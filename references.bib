abstract = "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) remains a leading cause of death in people with epilepsy. Despite the constant risk for patients and bereavement to family members, to date the physiological mechanisms of SUDEP remain unknown. Here we explore the potential to identify putative predictive signals of SUDEP from online digital behavioral data using text and sentiment analysis. Specifically, we analyze Facebook timelines of six epilepsy patients deceased due to SUDEP, donated by surviving family members. We find preliminary evidence for behavioral changes detectable by text and sentiment analysis tools. Namely, in the months preceding their SUDEP event patient social media timelines show: i) increase in verbosity; ii) increased use of functional words; and iii) sentiment shifts as measured by different sentiment analysis tools. Combined, these results suggest that social media engagement, as well as its sentiment, may serve as possible early-warning signals for SUDEP in people with epilepsy. While the small sample of patient timelines analyzed in this study prevents generalization, our preliminary investigation demonstrates the potential of social media data as complementary data in larger studies of SUDEP and epilepsy.",

author = "Savic, I and Bookheimer, S Y and Fried, I and Engel, Jr, J",
abstract = "BACKGROUND: Olfactory memory and discrimination are processed by the anteromesial temporal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Both functions may therefore be impaired in limbic epilepsy. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with mesial temporal lobe seizures (MTLS), 10 patients with neocortical seizures (NS), and 10 matched healthy control subjects underwent evaluation for olfactory quality discrimination (OD) and delayed recognition memory (OM). All patients were referred for presurgical evaluation. The olfactory tests were performed in a same-different paradigm with 10 seconds (OD) and 60 minutes (OM) between presentations of the odors, using the standardized University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. The presentations were monorhinal in the OD and birhinal in the OM tests. The results were related to regional glucose metabolism measured with fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Patients with MTLS had an impaired OD ipsilateral to the epileptogenic region (P < .001) and a higher total number of errors (including both tests) (P = .002). They also had lower OM scores, but not significantly lower than those of patients with NS (P = .05). The combined OM and OD tests correctly identified patients with MTLS with a sensitivity of 85\% and a specificity of 90\%, offering a correct lateralization in 74\% of patients. Patients with MTLS whose OD was more impaired than OM differed from those with more impaired OM by having a significant hypometabolism not only over the neocortex of the epileptogenic temporal lobe (P = .02) but also in the ipsilateral anterior (P = .008) and orbitofrontal cortex (P = .007) (2-way analysis of variance). CONCLUSIONS: Tests of olfactory function are useful in distinguishing between NS and MTLS. The impairments of OM and OD can be dissociated in pathological states and therefore mediated by different structures.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To assess the morbidity of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery on a nationwide level in order to address reservations regarding the morbidity of anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) for TLE despite class I evidence demonstrating the superiority of ATL over continued medical therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1988 to 2003 was used for analysis. PATIENTS: Only patients who were admitted for ATL for TLE (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 345.41 and 345.51; primary procedure code, 01.53) were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Morbidity and mortality. Analysis was adjusted for several variables including patient age, race, sex, admission type, primary payer for care, income in zip code of residence, and hospital volume of care. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses revealed that the overall morbidity (postoperative morbidity and/or adverse discharge disposition) following ATL for TLE was 10.8\%, with no mortality. Private insurance decreased postoperative morbidity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.52; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.28-0.98; P = .04) and adverse discharge disposition (OR = 0.31; 95\% CI = 0.12-0.81; P = .02). Increased patient age increased postoperative morbidity (OR = 1.04; 95\% CI = 1.01-1.07; P = .03) and adverse discharge disposition (OR = 1.08; 95\% CI = 1.02-1.13; P = .004). Neither sex, income, race, nor hospital volume was predictive of postoperative morbidity. The degree of medical comorbidity directly correlated with the incidence of postoperative morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Morbidity following ATL for TLE is low throughout the United States regardless of sex, race, insurance status, or income. Younger age and private insurance status are independently predictive of reduced postoperative morbidity. In patients with low medical comorbidity, ATL for TLE is safe, with low morbidity and no mortality.",

author = "Gavvala, Jay R and Schuele, Stephan U",
abstract = "Importance: Approximately 8\% to 10\% of the population will experience a seizure during their lifetime. Only about 2\% to 3\% of patients go on to develop epilepsy. Understanding the underlying etiology leading to an accurate diagnosis is necessary to ensure appropriate treatment and that patients with low risk for recurrence are not treated unnecessarily. Observations: Patients can present with new-onset seizure for a variety of reasons such as acute symptomatic seizures due to acute brain injury or metabolic derangements, or unprovoked seizures that are the initial manifestation of epilepsy. A patient history and physical examination may identify features more consistent with an epileptic event and laboratory studies and brain imaging can identify an acute insult contributing to the presentation. Patients diagnosed with first-time unprovoked seizure require electroencephalography and epilepsy protocol-specific magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, which includes thin-cut coronal slices to determine risk of recurrence and the need for long-term treatment. In patients who meet the criteria for diagnosis of epilepsy, a carefully selected antiepileptic medication with consideration of comorbidities, adverse effect profile, and type of epilepsy is essential along with appropriate counseling. Conclusions and Relevance: Approximately 3\% of the population will develop epilepsy but 2 to 3 times as many patients will experience a single seizure or seizure-like event. A diagnosis of epilepsy has significant medical, social, and emotional consequences. A careful patient history and physical examination, electroencephalography, and brain imaging are necessary to separate patients with acute symptomatic seizures, single unprovoked seizures, and nonepileptic events from those with new-onset epilepsy.",

abstract = "Importance: Functional seizures (formerly psychogenic nonepileptic seizures), paroxysmal episodes that are often similar to epileptic seizures in their clinical presentation and display no aberrant brain electrical patterns, are understudied. Patients experience a long diagnostic delay, few treatment modalities, a high rate of comorbidities, and significant stigma due to the lack of knowledge about functional seizures. Objective: To characterize the clinical epidemiology of a population of patients with functional seizures observed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study included patients with functional seizures identified in the VUMC electronic health record (VUMC-EHR) system from October 1989 to October 2018. Patients with epilepsy were excluded from the study and all remaining patients in the VUMC medical center system were used as controls. In total, the study included 1431 patients diagnosed with functional seizures, 2251 with epilepsy and functional seizures, 4715 with epilepsy without functional seizures, and 502 200 control patients who received treatment at VUMC for a minimum of a 3 years. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to March 2020. Exposure: Diagnosis of functional seizures, as identified from the VUMC-EHR system by an automated phenotyping algorithm that incorporated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, Current Procedural Terminology codes, and natural language processing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations of functional seizures with comorbidities and risk factors, measured in odds ratios (ORs). Results: Of 2 346 808 total patients in the VUMC-EHR aged 18 years or older, 3341 patients with functional seizures were identified (period prevalence, 0.14\%), 1062 (74.2\%) of whom were women and for which the median (interquartile range) age was 49.3 (39.4-59.9) years. This assessment replicated previously reported associations with psychiatric disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (OR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.21-1.24; P < 3.02 $\times$ 10-5), anxiety (OR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.15; P < 3.02 $\times$ 10-5), and depression (OR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.15; P < 3.02 $\times$ 10-5), and identified novel associations with cerebrovascular disease (OR, 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.09; P < 3.02 $\times$ 10-5). An association was found between functional seizures and the known risk factor sexual assault trauma (OR, 10.26; 95\% CI, 10.09-10.44; P < 3.02 $\times$ 10-5), and sexual assault trauma was found to mediate nearly a quarter of the association between female sex and functional seizures in the VUMC-EHR. Conclusions and Relevance: This case-control study found evidence to support previously reported associations, discovered new associations between functional seizures and PTSD, anxiety, and depression. An association between cerebrovascular disease and functional seizures was also found. Results suggested that sexual trauma may be a mediating factor in the association between female sex and functional seizures.",

abstract = "IMPORTANCE: Epileptic activity associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) deserves increased attention because it has a harmful impact on these patients, can easily go unrecognized and untreated, and may reflect pathogenic processes that also contribute to other aspects of the illness. We report key features of AD-related seizures and epileptiform activity that are instructive for clinical practice and highlight similarities between AD and transgenic animal models of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe common clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or early AD who also have epilepsy or subclinical epileptiform activity. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study from 2007 to 2012. SETTING Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco. PATIENTS: We studied 54 patients with a diagnosis of aMCI plus epilepsy (n = 12), AD plus epilepsy (n = 35), and AD plus subclinical epileptiform activity (n = 7). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical and demographic data, electroencephalogram (EEG) readings, and treatment responses to antiepileptic medications. RESULTS: Patients with aMCI who had epilepsy presented with symptoms of cognitive decline 6.8 years earlier than patients with aMCI who did not have epilepsy (64.3 vs 71.1 years; P = .02). Patients with AD who had epilepsy presented with cognitive decline 5.5 years earlier than patients with AD who did not have epilepsy (64.8 vs 70.3 years; P = .001). Patients with AD who had subclinical epileptiform activity also had an early onset of cognitive decline (58.9 years). The timing of seizure onset in patients with aMCI and AD was nonuniform (P < .001), clustering near the onset of cognitive decline. Epilepsies were most often complex partial seizures (47\%) and more than half were nonconvulsive (55\%). Serial or extended EEG monitoring appeared to be more effective than routine EEG at detecting interictal and subclinical epileptiform activity. Epileptic foci were predominantly unilateral and temporal. Of the most commonly prescribed antiepileptics, treatment outcomes appeared to be better for lamotrigine and levetiracetam than for phenytoin. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Common clinical features of patients with aMCI- or AD-associated epilepsy at our center included early age at onset of cognitive decline, early incidence of seizures in the disease course, unilateral temporal epileptic foci detected by serial/extended EEG, transient cognitive dysfunction, and good seizure control and tolerability with lamotrigine and levetiracetam. Careful identification and treatment of epilepsy in such patients may improve their clinical course.",

title = "Molecular Pathogenic Basis for {GABRG2} Mutations Associated With a Spectrum of Epilepsy Syndromes, From Generalized Absence Epilepsy to Dravet Syndrome",
author = "Kang, Jing-Qiong and Macdonald, Robert L",
abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In this review article, we focus on the molecular pathogenic basis for genetic generalized epilepsies associated with mutations in the inhibitory $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor $\gamma$2 subunit gene, GABRG2 (OMIM 137164), an established epilepsy gene. OBSERVATIONS: The $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor $\gamma$2 subunit gene, GABRG2, is abundantly expressed in the mammalian brain, and its encoded $\gamma$2 subunit is assembled into $\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$2 receptors, which are the major GABAA receptor isoforms in the brain. The $\gamma$2 subunits have a critical role in GABAA receptor trafficking and clustering at synapses. They reside inside the endoplasmic reticulum after synthesis, where they oligomerize with other binding partners, such as $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits, and further assemble into pentameric receptors. Only correctly assembled receptors can traffic beyond the endoplasmic reticulum and reach the cell surface and synapses, where they conduct chloride ion current when activated by GABA. Mutations in GABRG2 have been associated with simple febrile seizures and with genetic epilepsy syndromes, including childhood absence epilepsy, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, and Dravet syndrome or severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy. The mutations include missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, as well as splice-site and deletion mutations. The mutations have been identified in both coding and noncoding sequences like splice sites. In the coding sequence, these mutations are found in multiple locations, including the extracellular N-terminus, transmembrane domains, and transmembrane 3-transmembrane 4 intracellular loop. All of these mutations reduced channel function but to different extents and by diverse mechanisms, including nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay, endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation, dominant negative suppression of partnering subunits, mutant subunit aggregation causing cell stress and cell death, and gating defects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We conclude that the epilepsy phenotypic heterogeneity associated with GABRG2 mutations may be related to the extent of the reduction of GABAA receptor channel function and the differential dominant negative suppression, as well to toxicity related to the metabolism of mutant subunit proteins resulting from each mutant $\gamma$2 subunit, in addition to different genetic backgrounds.",

abstract = "Importance: A better understanding of the role of cortical structures in blood pressure control may help us understand cardiovascular collapse that may lead to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Objective: To identify cortical control sites for human blood pressure regulation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing intracranial electrode implantation as a prelude to epilepsy surgery in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center were potential candidates for this study. Inclusion criteria were patients 18 years or older who had electrodes implanted in one or more of the regions of interest and in whom deep brain electrical stimulation was indicated for mapping of ictal onset or eloquent cortex as a part of the presurgical evaluation. Twelve consecutive patients were included in this prospective case series from June 1, 2015, to February 28, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in continuous, noninvasive, beat-by-beat blood pressure parameter responses from amygdala, hippocampal, insular, orbitofrontal, temporal, cingulate, and subcallosal stimulation. Electrocardiogram, arterial oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, nasal airflow, and abdominal and thoracic plethysmography were monitored. Results: Among 12 patients (7 female; mean [SD] age, 44.25 [12.55] years), 9 electrodes (7 left and 2 right) all in Brodmann area 25 (subcallosal neocortex) in 4 patients produced striking systolic hypotensive changes. Well-maintained diastolic arterial blood pressure and narrowed pulse pressure indicated stimulation-induced reduction in sympathetic drive and consequent probable reduction in cardiac output rather than bradycardia or peripheral vasodilation-induced hypotension. Frequency-domain analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variability showed a mixed picture. No other stimulated structure produced significant blood pressure changes. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that Brodmann area 25 has a role in lowering systolic blood pressure in humans. It is a potential symptomatogenic zone for peri-ictal hypotension in patients with epilepsy.",

abstract = "Importance: People with epilepsy are at increased risk of mortality, but, to date, the cause-specific risks of all unnatural causes have not been reported. Objective: To estimate cause-specific unnatural mortality risks in people with epilepsy and to identify the medication types involved in poisoning deaths. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used 2 electronic primary care data sets linked to hospitalization and mortality records, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in England (from January 1, 1998, to March 31, 2014) and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank in Wales (from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2014). Each person with epilepsy was matched on age (within 2 years), sex, and general practice with up to 20 individuals without epilepsy. Unnatural mortality was determined using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes V01 through Y98 in the Office for National Statistics mortality records. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated in each data set using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, and meta-analyses were conducted using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models. The analysis was performed from January 5, 2016, to November 16, 2017. Exposures: People with epilepsy were identified using primary care epilepsy diagnoses and associated antiepileptic drug prescriptions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratios (HRs) for unnatural mortality and the frequency of each involved medication type estimated as a percentage of all medication poisoning deaths. Results: In total, 44 678 individuals in the CPRD and 14 051 individuals in the SAIL Databank were identified in the prevalent epilepsy cohorts, and 891 429 (CPRD) and 279 365 (SAIL) individuals were identified in the comparison cohorts. In both data sets, 51\% of the epilepsy and comparison cohorts were male, and the median age at entry was 40 years (interquartile range, 25-60 years) in the CPRD cohorts and 43 years (interquartile range, 24-64 years) in the SAIL cohorts. People with epilepsy were significantly more likely to die of any unnatural cause (HR, 2.77; 95\% CI, 2.43-3.16), unintentional injury or poisoning (HR, 2.97; 95\% CI, 2.54-3.48) or suicide (HR, 2.15; 95\% CI, 1.51-3.07) than people in the comparison cohort. Particularly large risk increases were observed in the epilepsy cohorts for unintentional medication poisoning (HR, 4.99; 95\% CI, 3.22-7.74) and intentional self-poisoning with medication (HR, 3.55; 95\% CI, 1.01-12.53). Opioids (56.5\% [95\% CI, 43.3\%-69.0\%]) and psychotropic medication (32.3\% [95\% CI, 20.9\%-45.3\%)] were more commonly involved than antiepileptic drugs (9.7\% [95\% CI, 3.6\%-19.9\%]) in poisoning deaths in people with epilepsy. Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with people without epilepsy, people with epilepsy are at increased risk of unnatural death and thus should be adequately advised about unintentional injury prevention and monitored for suicidal ideation, thoughts, and behaviors. The suitability and toxicity of concomitant medication should be considered when prescribing for comorbid conditions.",

Objective: To determine if the level of care (non-neurologist, neurologist, or comprehensive epilepsy program) is negatively associated with the risk of premature mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective open cohort study, all adult patients 18 years or older who met the administrative case definition for incident epilepsy in linked databases (Alberta Health Services administrative health data and the Comprehensive Calgary Epilepsy Programme Registry [CEP]) inclusive of the years 2002 to 2016 were followed up until death or loss to follow-up. The final analyses were performed on May 1, 2019. Exposures: Evaluation by a non-neurologist, neurologist, or epileptologist. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was all-cause mortality. We used extended Cox models treating exposure to a neurologist or the CEP as time-varying covariates. Age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, disease severity, and comorbid burden at index date were modeled as fixed-time coefficients. Results: A total 23 653 incident cases were identified (annual incidence of 89 per 100 000); the mean age (SD) at index date was 50.8 (19.1) years and 12 158 (50.3\%) were women. A total of 14 099 (60\%) were not exposed to specialist neurological care, 9554 (40\%) received care by a neurologist, and 2054 (9\%) received care in the CEP. In total, 4098 deaths (71\%) occurred in the nonspecialist setting, 1481 (26\%) for those seen by a neurologist, and 176 (3\%) for those receiving CEP care. The standardized mortality rate was 7.2\% for the entire cohort, 9.4\% for those receiving nonspecialist care, 5.6\% for those seen by a neurologist, and 2.8\% for those seen in the CEP. The hazard ratio (HR) of mortality was lower in those receiving neurologist (HR, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.77-0.93) and CEP (HR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.38-0.62) care. In multivariable modeling, specialist care, the age at index, and disease severity were retained in the final model of the association between specialist care and mortality.

Objective: To determine whether incident LOSU is associated with a higher risk of dementia among older US veterans. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted using data from US Veterans Health Administration medical centers from October 2001 to September 2015. Data were generated from all veteran inpatient and outpatient encounters that occurred within Veterans Health Administration facilities. A random sample of 941 524 veterans 55 years and older was generated. A total of 649 262 veterans previously diagnosed (using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes) with dementia, unprovoked seizures, epilepsy, and conditions that could lead to seizures (brain tumors, trauma, infections, stroke, and neurotoxin exposure) as well as veterans without follow-up data were excluded. Data were analyzed from October 2018 to July 2019. Exposures: Late-onset unprovoked seizures of unknown etiology were defined as a new diagnosis of epilepsy or unprovoked seizures without a diagnosis of a secondary cause for seizures. Incident LOSU was assessed during a 5-year baseline period. Main Outcomes and Measures: Veterans were assessed for incident dementia diagnosis during an outcome period. Fine-Gray proportional hazards models were used to determine whether LOSU was associated with greater risk of incident dementia. Models were adjusted for demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors, depression, and traumatic brain injury. Results: Of the 292 262 included veterans, 282 628 (96.7\%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 73.0 [8.8] years. During the baseline period, 2166 veterans developed LOSU. The mean (SD) follow-up after LOSU was 6.1 (2.9) years. After multivariable adjustment, veterans with LOSU had greater risk of dementia compared with veterans without seizures (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95\% CI, 1.62-2.20). A sensitivity analysis imposing a 2-year lag between incident LOSU and dementia diagnosis led to similar results. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest LOSU in older veterans is associated with a 2-fold risk of developing dementia. While seizures are commonly thought to occur in late stages of dementia, these findings suggest unexplained seizures in older adults may be a first sign of neurodegenerative disease.",

abstract = "Mossy fiber sprouting into the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus is an important neuroplastic change found in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy and in humans with this type of epilepsy. Recently, we reported in the perforant path stimulation model another neuroplastic change for dentate granule cells following seizures: hilar basal dendrites (HBDs). The present study determined whether status epilepticus-induced HBDs on dentate granule cells occur in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy and whether these dendrites are targeted by mossy fibers. Retrograde transport of biocytin following its ejection into stratum lucidum of CA3 was used to label granule cells for both light and electron microscopy. Granule cells with a heterogeneous morphology, including recurrent basal dendrites, and locations outside the granule cell layer were observed in control preparations. Preparations from both pilocarpine and kainate models of temporal lobe epilepsy also showed granule cells with HBDs. These dendrites branched and extended into the hilus of the dentate gyrus and were shown to be present on 5\% of the granule cells in pilocarpine-treated rats with status epilepticus, whereas control rats had virtually none. Electron microscopy was used to determine whether HBDs were postsynaptic to axon terminals in the hilus, a site where mossy fiber collaterals are prevalent. Labeled granule cell axon terminals were found to form asymmetric synapses with labeled HBDs. Also, unlabeled, large mossy fiber boutons were presynaptic to HBDs of granule cells. These results indicate that HBDs are present in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy, confirm the presence of HBDs in the kainate model, and show that HBDs are postsynaptic to mossy fibers. These new mossy fiber synapses with HBDs may contribute to additional recurrent excitatory circuitry for granule cells. J. Comp. Neurol. 428:240--253, 2000. \copyright{} 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The chapter provides an overview of interictal dysphoric disorder (IDD), a common ?atypical? affective disorder in epilepsy. It also talks about generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and suicide. Psychoses of epilepsy, forced normalization (FN), mental and behavioural disorders secondary to AED, and personality disorders in epilepsy are some additional disorders discussed.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects 1\% of the population. Approximately, 30\% of individuals with epilepsy are refractory to treatment, highlighting the need for novel therapies. Conventional anticonvulsant screening relies predominantly on induced seizure models. However, these models may not be etiologically relevant for genetic epilepsies. Mutations in SCN1A are a common cause of Dravet Syndrome, a severe epileptic encephalopathy. Dravet syndrome typically begins in infancy with seizures provoked by fever and then progresses to include afebrile pleomorphic seizure types. Affected children respond poorly to available anticonvulsants. Scn1a+/- heterozygous knockout mice recapitulate features of Dravet syndrome and provide a potential screening platform to investigate novel therapeutics. In this study, we conducted a screening of conventional anticonvulsants in Scn1a+/- mice to establish assays that most closely correlate with human response data. METHODS: On the basis of clinical response data from a large, single center, retrospective survey of Dravet syndrome case records, we selected nine drugs for screening in Scn1a+/- mice to determine which phenotypic measures correlate best with human therapeutic response. We evaluated several screening paradigms and incorporated pharmacokinetic monitoring to establish drug exposure levels. RESULTS: Scn1a+/- mice exhibited responses to anticonvulsant treatment similar to those observed clinically. Sodium channel blockers were not effective or exacerbated seizures in Scn1a+/- mice. Overall, clobazam was the most effective anticonvulsant in Scn1a+/- mice, consistent with its effect in Dravet syndrome. INTERPRETATION: Genetic models of spontaneous epilepsy provide alternative screening platforms and may augment the AED development process. In this study, we established an effective screening platform that pharmacologically validated Scn1a+/- mice for preclinical screening of potential Dravet syndrome therapeutics.",

METHODS: We selected cases with clinical DS, $\geq$6 years, SCN1A mutation, and $\geq$1 seizure/week. Home-based ECG recordings were performed for 20 days continuously. Cases were matched for age and sex to two epilepsy controls with no DS and $\geq$1 major motor seizure during video-EEG. We determined the prevalence of peri-ictal asystole, bradycardia, QTc changes, and effects of convulsive seizures (CS) on heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and PR/QRS. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for multiple seizures within subjects, seizure type, and sleep/wakefulness. RESULTS: We included 59 cases. Ictal recordings were obtained in 45 cases and compared to 90 controls. We analyzed 547 seizures in DS (300 CS) and 169 in controls (120 CS). No asystole occurred. Postictal bradycardia was more common in controls (n = 11, 6.5\%) than cases (n = 4, 0.7\%; P = 0.002). Peri-ictal QTc-lengthening ($\geq$60ms) occurred more frequently in DS (n = 64, 12\%) than controls (n = 8, 4.7\%, P = 0.048); pathologically prolonged QTc was rare (once in each group). In DS, interictal HRV was lower compared to controls (RMSSD P = 0.029); peri-ictal values did not differ between the groups. Prolonged QRS/PR was rare and more common in controls (QRS: one vs. none; PR: three vs. one). INTERPRETATION: We did not identify major arrhythmias in DS which can directly explain high SUDEP rates.

Pathogenic variants were identified in DEPDC5 and TSC2, both major genes for Mendelian FE syndromes. Interpretation: Our findings support the contribution of ultrarare variants in genes in the mTOR pathway complexes GATOR and TSC to the risk of sporadic FE and a shared genetic basis between rare and common epilepsies.

Using 2010 diagnostic criteria, three patients had classical Rett syndrome, including two for whom repeat MECP2 gene testing had identified mutations. In a patient with neonatal onset epilepsy with atypical Rett syndrome, we identified a frameshift deletion in STXBP1. Among seven patients with features of Rett syndrome not fulfilling formal diagnostic criteria, four had suspected pathogenic mutations, one each in MECP2, FOXG1, SCN8A, and IQSEC2.

Bromodeoxyuridine labeling, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were used to identify proliferating progenitors and mature DGCs in the adult rat pilocarpine temporal lobe epilepsy model. We also examined dentate gyri from epileptic human hippocampal surgical specimens. Prox-1 immunohistochemistry and pulse-chase bromodeoxyuridine labeling showed that progenitors migrate aberrantly to the hilus and molecular layer after prolonged seizures and differentiate into ectopic DGCs in rat. Neuroblast marker expression indicated the delayed appearance of chainlike progenitor cell formations extending into the hilus and molecular layer, suggesting that seizures alter migratory behavior of DGC precursors. Ectopic putative DGCs also were found in the hilus and molecular layer of epileptic human dentate gyrus. These findings indicate that seizure-induced abnormalities of neuroblast migration lead to abnormal integration of newborn DGCs in the epileptic adult hippocampus, and implicate aberrant neurogenesis in the development or progression of recurrent seizures.",

A Mann-Whitney U test showed that PGES was significantly longer in the generalized motor seizures of the SUDEP group (p 50 seconds (p 50 seconds) appears to identify refractory epilepsy patients who are at risk of SUDEP.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), although hippocampal atrophy lateralizes the focus, the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict postsurgical outcome is rather modest. Prediction solely based on the hippocampus may be hampered by widespread mesiotemporal structural damage shown by advanced imaging. Increasingly complex and high-dimensional representation of MRI metrics motivates a shift to machine learning to establish objective, data-driven criteria for pathogenic processes and prognosis. METHODS: We applied clustering to 114 consecutive unilateral TLE patients using 1.5T MRI profiles derived from surface morphology of hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex. To evaluate the diagnostic validity of the classification, we assessed its yield to predict outcome in 79 surgically treated patients. Reproducibility of outcome prediction was assessed in an independent cohort of 27 patients evaluated on 3.0T MRI. RESULTS: Four similarly sized classes partitioned our cohort; in all, alterations spanned over the 3 mesiotemporal structures. Compared to 46 controls, TLE-I showed marked bilateral atrophy; in TLE-II atrophy was ipsilateral; TLE-III showed mild bilateral atrophy; whereas TLE-IV showed hypertrophy. Classes differed with regard to histopathology and freedom from seizures. Classwise surface-based classifiers accurately predicted outcome in 92 $\pm$ 1\% of patients, outperforming conventional volumetry. Predictors of relapse were distributed bilaterally across structures. Prediction accuracy was similarly high in the independent cohort (96\%), supporting generalizability. INTERPRETATION: We provide a novel description of individual variability across the TLE spectrum. Class membership was associated with distinct patterns of damage and outcome predictors that did not spatially overlap, emphasizing the ability of machine learning to disentangle the differential contribution of morphology to patient phenotypes, ultimately refining the prognosis of epilepsy surgery.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy often display cognitive comorbidity with recurrent seizures. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the impairment of neuronal information processing remain poorly understood in temporal lobe epilepsy. Within the hippocampal formation neuronal networks undergo major reorganization, including the sprouting of mossy fibers in the dentate gyrus; they establish aberrant recurrent synapses between dentate granule cells and operate via postsynaptic kainate receptors. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that this aberrant local circuit alters information processing of perforant path inputs constituting the major excitatory afferent pathway from entorhinal cortex to dentate granule cells. METHODS: Experiments were performed in dentate granule cells from control rats and rats with temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine hydrochloride treatment. Neurons were recorded in patch clamp in whole cell configuration in hippocampal slices. RESULTS: Our present data revealed that an aberrant readout of synaptic inputs by kainate receptors triggered a long-lasting impairment of the perforant path input-output operation in epileptic dentate granule cells. We demonstrated that this is due to the aberrant activity-dependent potentiation of the persistent sodium current altering intrinsic firing properties of dentate granule cells. INTERPRETATION: We propose that this aberrant activity-dependent intrinsic plasticity, which lastingly impairs the information processing of cortical inputs in dentate gyrus, may participate in hippocampal-related cognitive deficits, such as those reported in patients with epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The DEPDC5 (DEP domain-containing protein 5) gene, encoding a repressor of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, has recently emerged as a major gene mutated in familial focal epilepsies. We aimed to further extend the role of DEPDC5 to focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs). METHODS: Seven patients from 4 families with DEPDC5 mutations and focal epilepsy associated with FCD were recruited and investigated at the clinical, neuroimaging, and histopathological levels. The DEPDC5 gene was sequenced from genomic blood and brain DNA. RESULTS: All patients had drug-resistant focal epilepsy, 5 of them underwent surgery, and 1 had a brain biopsy. Electroclinical phenotypes were compatible with FCD II, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was typical in only 4 cases. Histopathology confirmed FCD IIa in 2 patients (including 1 MRI-negative case) and showed FCD I in 2 other patients, and remained inconclusive in the last 2 patients. Three patients were seizure-free postsurgically, and 1 had a worthwhile improvement. Sequencing of blood DNA revealed truncating DEPDC5 mutations in all 4 families; 1 mutation was found to be mosaic in an asymptomatic father. A brain somatic DEPDC5 mutation was identified in 1 patient in addition to the germline mutation. INTERPRETATION: Germline, germline mosaic, and brain somatic DEPDC5 mutations may cause epilepsy associated with FCD, reinforcing the link between mTORC1 pathway and FCDs. Similarly to other mTORopathies, a ``2-hit'' mutational model could be responsible for cortical lesions. Our study also indicates that epilepsy surgery is a valuable alternative in the treatment of drug-resistant DEPDC5-positive focal epilepsies, even if the MRI is unremarkable.",

Recently, we identified mutations in DEPDC5 as a cause of familial focal epilepsy. In this study, we investigated whether mutations in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulators, NPRL2 and NPRL3, also contribute to cases of focal epilepsy. METHODS: We used targeted capture and next-generation sequencing to analyze 404 unrelated probands with focal epilepsy. We performed exome sequencing on two families with multiple members affected with focal epilepsy and linkage analysis on one of these. RESULTS: In our cohort of 404 unrelated focal epilepsy patients, we identified five mutations in NPRL2 and five in NPRL3. Exome sequencing analysis of two families with focal epilepsy identified NPRL2 and NPRL3 as the top candidate-causative genes. Some patients had focal epilepsy associated with brain malformations. We also identified 18 new mutations in DEPDC5. INTERPRETATION: We have identified NPRL2 and NPRL3 as two new focal epilepsy genes that also play a role in the mTOR-signaling pathway. Our findings show that mutations in GATOR1 complex genes are the most significant cause of familial focal epilepsy identified to date, including cases with brain malformations. It is possible that deregulation of cellular growth control plays a more important role in epilepsy than is currently recognized.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The leading cause of epilepsy-related premature mortality is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The cause of SUDEP remains unknown. To search for genetic risk factors in SUDEP cases, we performed an exome-based analysis of rare variants. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information of 61 SUDEP cases were collected. Exome sequencing and rare variant collapsing analysis with 2,936 control exomes were performed to test for genes enriched with damaging variants. Additionally, cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory control, and epilepsy genes were screened for variants with frequency of <0.1\% and predicted to be pathogenic with multiple in silico tools. RESULTS: The 61 SUDEP cases were categorized as definite SUDEP (n = 54), probable SUDEP (n = 5), and definite SUDEP plus (n = 2). We identified de novo mutations, previously reported pathogenic mutations, or candidate pathogenic variants in 28 of 61 (46\%) cases. Four SUDEP cases (7\%) had mutations in common genes responsible for the cardiac arrhythmia disease, long QT syndrome (LQTS). Nine cases (15\%) had candidate pathogenic variants in dominant cardiac arrhythmia genes. Fifteen cases (25\%) had mutations or candidate pathogenic variants in dominant epilepsy genes. No gene reached genome-wide significance with rare variant collapsing analysis; however, DEPDC5 (p = 0.00015) and KCNH2 (p = 0.0037) were among the top 30 genes, genome-wide. INTERPRETATION: A sizeable proportion of SUDEP cases have clinically relevant mutations in cardiac arrhythmia and epilepsy genes. In cases with an LQTS gene mutation, SUDEP may occur as a result of a predictable and preventable cause. Understanding the genetic basis of SUDEP may inform cascade testing of at-risk family members.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To understand how monosynaptic inputs onto adult-born dentate granule cells (DGCs) are altered in experimental mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) and whether their integration differs from early-born DGCs that are mature at the time of epileptogenesis. METHODS: A dual-virus tracing strategy combining retroviral birthdating with rabies virus-mediated putative retrograde trans-synaptic tracing was used to identify and compare presynaptic inputs onto adult- and early-born DGCs in the rat pilocarpine model of mTLE. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that hilar ectopic DGCs preferentially synapse onto adult-born DGCs after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) while normotopic DGCs synapse onto both adult- and early-born DGCs. We also find that parvalbumin+ and somatostatin+ interneuron inputs are greatly diminished onto early-born DGCs after SE. However, somatostatin+ interneuron inputs onto adult-born DGCs are maintained, likely due to preferential sprouting. Intriguingly, CA3 pyramidal cell backprojections that specifically target adult-born DGCs arise in the epileptic brain, while axons of interneurons and pyramidal cells in CA1 appear to sprout across the hippocampal fissure to preferentially synapse onto early-born DGCs. INTERPRETATION: These data support the presence of substantial hippocampal circuit remodeling after an epileptogenic insult that generates prominent excitatory monosynaptic inputs, both local recurrent and widespread feedback loops, involving DGCs. Both adult- and early-born DGCs are targets of new inputs from other DGCs as well as from CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells after pilocarpine-treatment, changes that likely contribute to epileptogenesis in experimental mTLE.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Structural and functional imaging studies in focal epilepsy often reveal distributed regions of abnormality. These are interpreted as representing the existence of epileptic networks, but the presence of actual neuronal interactions between these regions has not been demonstrated. We sought to determine whether the distributed hemodynamic responses often seen in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of scalp interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) actually correspond to synchronized neuronal activities when examining the intracerebral electroencephalogram (iEEG) at distant nodes of the network. METHODS: We studied 28 patients who underwent first EEG-fMRI and then iEEG, and had significant hemodynamic responses in the gray matter. We coregistered the hemodynamic responses to the iEEG electrode contact positions and analyzed synchrony, measured by correlation, between IEDs recorded by iEEG in regions with and without hemodynamic responses. RESULTS: The synchrony of intracerebral IED activity between pairs of regions showing a hemodynamic response was higher compared to that between pairs of regions without (p < 0.0001) and between pairs of regions, one with and one without hemodynamic response (p < 0.0001). These differences were found during the interictal periods with IEDs but were absent during the interictal periods without IEDs. Higher synchrony was also observed between regions involved at seizure onset (p < 0.0001). INTERPRETATION: EEG-fMRI studies are unique in their ability to reveal hemodynamic concomitants of IEDs anywhere in the brain. This study proves that iEEG activity is synchronized between these regions of hemodynamic response, thus demonstrating the existence of an actual neuronally based interictal epileptic network. This also validates the EEG-fMRI approach to reveal this network noninvasively. Ann Neurol 2017;82:57-66.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The cause of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is often unknown. We ascertained to what extent newly-diagnosed non-lesional MTLE actually represents familial MTLE (FMTLE). METHODS: We identified all consecutive patients presenting to the Austin Heath First Seizure Clinic with MTLE and a normal MRI or MRI-evidence of hippocampal sclerosis over a 10-year period. Patients' first-degree relatives and pairwise age- and sex-matched controls underwent a comprehensive epilepsy interview. Each interview transcript was reviewed independently by two epileptologists, blinded to relative or control status. Reviewers classified each subject as follows: epilepsy, specifying if MTLE; manifestations suspicious of epilepsy; or unaffected. Physiological d{\'e}j{\`a} vu was noted. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included. At the Clinic, MTLE had been recognized to be familial in 2 patients only. Among 242 subjects interviewed, MTLE was diagnosed in 9/121 relatives vs 0/121 controls (p=0.008). All affected relatives had seizures with intense d{\'e}j{\`a} vu and accompanying features; 6 relatives had not been previously diagnosed. D{\'e}j{\`a} vu experiences which were suspicious, but not diagnostic, of MTLE occurred in 6 additional relatives vs none of the controls (p=0.04). Physiological d{\'e}j{\`a} vu was common, and did not differ significantly between relatives and controls. After completing the relatives' interviews, FMTLE was diagnosed in 8 of 44 patients (18.2\%). INTERPRETATION: FMTLE accounts for almost one-fifth of newly diagnosed non-lesional MTLE, and it is largely unrecognized without direct questioning of relatives.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests that disordered breathing is critically involved in Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). To that end, evaluating structures that are activated by seizures and can activate brain regions that produce cardiorespiratory changes can further our understanding of the pathophysiology of SUDEP. Past preclinical studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the human amygdala induces apnea, suggesting a role for the amygdala in controlling respiration. In this study, we aimed to both confirm these findings in a larger group of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and also further explore the anatomical and cognitive properties of this effect. METHODS: Seven surgical TLE patients had depth electrodes implanted in the amygdala that were used to deliver electrical stimulation during functional mapping preceding resection. Real-time respiratory monitoring was performed in each patient to confirm apnea. RESULTS: Our data confirm that amygdala stimulation reliably induces apnea (occurring in all 7 patients) and further suggest that apnea can be overcome by instructing the patient to inhale, and can be prevented entirely by breathing through the mouth before electrical stimulation. Finally, stimulation-induced apnea occurred only when stimulating the medial-most amygdalar contacts located in the central nucleus. INTERPRETATION: These findings confirm a functional connection between the amygdala and respiratory control in humans. Moreover, they suggest specific amygdalar nuclei may be critical in mediating this effect and that attentional state is critical to apnea mediated by amygdala activation-perhaps alluding to future development of strategies for the prevention of SUDEP.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common treatment for medically-intractable epilepsy, but response rates are highly variable with no pre-operative means of identifying good candidates. This study aimed to predict VNS response using structural and functional connectomic profiling. METHODS: Fifty-six children, comprising Discovery (N = 38) and Validation (N = 18) Cohorts, were recruited from three separate institutions. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to identify group differences in white-matter microstructure, which in turn informed beamforming of resting-state magnetoencephalography recordings. The results were used to generate a support vector machine learning classifier, which was independently validated. This algorithm was compared to a second classifier generated using 31 clinical covariates. RESULTS: Treatment responders demonstrated greater fractional anisotropy in left thalamocortical, limbic, and association fibres, as well as greater connectivity in a functional network encompassing left thalamic, insular, and temporal nodes (p < 0.05). The resulting classifier demonstrated 89.5\% accuracy and area under the ROC curve of 0.93 on 10-fold cross-validation. In the external Validation Cohort, this model demonstrated an accuracy of 83.3\% with a sensitivity of 85.7\% and specificity of 75.0\%. This was significantly superior to predictions using clinical covariates alone, which exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.57 (p < 0.008). INTERPRETATION: This study provides the first multi-institutional, multi-modal connectomic prediction algorithm for VNS, and provides new insights into its mechanism of action.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Insula epilepsy is rare and can be evaluated effectively by Stereotactic intracerebral EEG (SEEG). Many previous studies of insulo-opercular seizures have been unable to separate insular and opercular onset. With adequate sampling of the insula, this study shows this is possible. METHODS: We analyzed intrainsular dynamics and extrainsular propagation in 12 patients with ``pure'' insula epilepsy (n = 9) or insular and only deepest opercular involvement (n = 3) at seizure onset. Review of semiology defined clinical groups, agglomerative cluster, and principal component analysis of semiological features were performed. Quantitative epileptogenicity, and intrainsular and extrainsular propagation were computed via time frequency analysis and epileptogenicity mapping. RESULTS: Seizure onset patterns were heterogeneous; the seizure onset zone was focal. Seizure onset and first ictal change within insula functional subdivision correlated with aura and reflex component. No paninsular spread occurred; contralateral insular spread was very early. While the discharge was intrainsular, clinical signs related to aura or vegetative signs. Extrainsular propagation was early and related to the emergence of the majority of clinical signs. Cluster analysis found an anterior, intermediate, and posterior insula seizure onset group. The largest principal component separated anterior insula manifestations, including early hypermotor signs, early recovery, and no aura from posterior insula features of early dystonia, early tonic motor features, and sensorimotor aura. INTERPRETATION: Aura is vital to identifying seizure onset and relates to insula functional subdivision. Seizures are heterogenous; extrainsular propagation occurs early, accounting for most of the semiology. With adequate sampling, ``pure'' insula epilepsy can be identified and focal curative resection is possible. ANN NEUROL 2020.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an unpredictable and devastating comorbidity of epilepsy that is believed to be due to cardiorespiratory failure immediately after generalized convulsive seizures. METHODS: We performed cardiorespiratory monitoring of seizure-induced death in mice carrying either an p.Arg1872Trp or p.Asn1768Asp mutation in a single Scn8a allele - mutations identified from patients that died from SUDEP - and by seizure-induced death of pentylenetetrazole-treated wild type mice. RESULTS: The primary cause of seizure-induced death for all mice was apnea, as 1) apnea began during a seizure and continued for tens of minutes until terminal asystole, and 2) death was prevented by mechanical ventilation. Fatal seizures always included a tonic phase that was coincident with apnea. This tonic phase apnea was not sufficient to produce death, as it also occurred during many nonfatal seizures; however, all seizures that were fatal had tonic phase apnea. We also made the novel observation that continuous tonic diaphragm contraction occurred during tonic phase apnea, which likely contributes to apnea by preventing exhalation, and this was only fatal when breathing did not resume after the tonic phase ended. Finally, recorded seizures from a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy with a previously undocumented SCN8A likely pathogenic variant (p,Leu257Val) revealed similarities to those of the mice; an extended tonic phase that was accompanied by apnea. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that apnea coincident with the tonic phase of a seizure, and subsequent failure to resume breathing, are the determining events that cause seizure-induced death in Scn8a mutant mice.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Intracranial EEG (icEEG) studies show that interictal ripples propagate across the brain of children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE) and the onset of this propagation (ripple-onset-zone, ROZ) estimates the epileptogenic zone. It is still unknown whether we can map this propagation non-invasively. The goal of this study is to map ripples (ripple-zone, RZ) and their propagation onset (ROZ) using high-density EEG (HD-EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and to estimate their prognostic value in pediatric epilepsy surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed simultaneous HD-EEG and MEG data from 28 children with MRE who underwent icEEG and epilepsy surgery. Using electric and magnetic source imaging, we estimated virtual sensors (VSs) at brain locations that matched the icEEG implantation. We detected ripples on VSs, defined virtual-RZ and virtual-ROZ, and estimated their distance from icEEG. We assessed the predictive value of resecting virtual-RZ and virtual-ROZ for postsurgical outcome. Interictal spike localization on HD-EEG and MEG was also performed and compared with ripples. RESULTS: We mapped ripple propagation in all patients with HD-EEG and in 27 (96\%) patients with MEG. The distance from icEEG did not differ between HD-EEG and MEG when mapping the RZ (26-27 mm; p = 0.6) or ROZ (22-24 mm; p = 0.4). Resecting the virtual-ROZ, but not virtual-RZ or the sources of spikes, was associated with good outcome for HD-EEG (p = 0.016) and MEG (p = 0.047).

Two novel Depdc5 mouse strains, a HA-tagged Depdc5 mouse strain and a Depdc5 heterozygous knockout with a neuron-specific deletion of the second allele (Depdc5c/- ) were generated to investigate the role of Depdc5 in SUDEP and cardiac activity during seizures. RESULTS: Holter, echocardiography and ECG exams provided no evidence for altered clinical cardiac function in the patient cohort, of whom three DEPDC5-patients succumbed to a SUDEP and six had a family history of SUDEP. There was no cardiac injury at autopsy in a postmortem DEPDC5-SUDEP case. The HA-tagged Depdc5 mouse revealed expression of Depdc5 in the brain, heart and lungs. Simultaneous EEG-ECG records on Depdc5c/- mice showed that spontaneous epileptic seizures resulting in a SUDEP-like event, are not preceded by cardiac arrhythmia. INTERPRETATION: Mouse and human data show neither structural nor functional cardiac damage that might underlie a primary contribution to SUDEP in the spectrum of DEPDC5-related epilepsies.

abstract = "Twenty-five patients with occipital lobe seizure origin were retrospectively evaluated to determine clinical seizure characteristics and electroencephalographic manifestations. Certain symptoms and signs served to identify occipital lobe origin in 22 (88\%). These included elementary visual hallucinations, ictal amaurosis, eye movement sensations, early forced blinking or eyelid flutter, and visual field deficits. Eye or head deviation, or both, was observed frequently and was contralateral to the side of seizure origin in 13, but 3 patients exhibited ipsilateral deviation in some or all their seizures. After the initial signs and symptoms, clinical seizure characteristics resembled those of seizures originating elsewhere. Seizures typical of temporal lobe origin with loss of contact and various types of automatic, semipurposeful activity occurred in 11 patients. Seizures in 3 patients exhibited asymmetrical tonic or focal clonic motor patterns characteristic of frontal lobe seizures. Eleven of the 25 patients had, on two occasions, two or more distinctly different seizure types. Scalp electroencephalographic findings were seldom helpful for occipital lobe localization and were frequently misleading. Intracranial electroencephalographic recording correctly identified occipital lobe seizure origin in most, but not all, patients who had such studies. Intracranial electroencephalic recording also proved the variability in clinical seizure characteristics was related to different seizure spread patterns, medially or laterally above and below the sylvian fissure, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the occipital lobe of seizure origin. Eighteen patients had occipital lobe lesions detected with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans or both. Resection of the lesions in 16 patients produced excellent results in 14 (88\%). Five patients had temporal lobectomies, with good results in 3, but poor results in 2. Two patients with unlocalized seizures had complete section of the corpus callosum, 1 with a good result and the other with a poor result.",

author = "Sloviter, Robert S",
abstract = "Temporal lobe seizures are frequently associated with a characteristic pattern of hippocampal pathology (hippocampal sclerosis), as well as pathology in other temporal lobe structures. Despite more than a century of study, the relationship between pathology and epileptogenesis remains unclear. Endfolium sclerosis, which is characterized by the loss of dentate hilar neurons that are presumed to govern dentate granule cell excitability, is evident whenever hippocampal sclerosis exists and is the only temporal lobe pathology in some patients. Because prolonged seizures or head trauma produce endfolium sclerosis and granule cell hyperexictability in experimental animals, hilar neuron loss may be the common pathological denominator and primary network defect underlying development of a hippocampal seizure ``focus.'' Physiological studies suggest that vulnerable hilar mossy cells normally excite neurons that mediate granule cell inhibition. Recent anatomical studies indicate that the axons of mossy cells project longitudinally, out of the lamellar plane in which their cell bodies lie. If mossy cells in one lamella excite inhibitory neurons in surrounding lamellae, neocortical excitation of one segment of the granule cell layer may produce lateral inhibition and limit neocortical excitation to the targeted lamella. In patients who have had status epilepticus, prolonged febrile seizures, head trauma, or encephalitis, loss of dentate mossy cells may deafferent inhibitory neurons, render them ``dormant,'' and thereby disinhibit an encephalitis, loss of dentate mossy cells may deafferent inhibitory neurons, render them ``dormant,'' and thereby disinhibit an enlarged expanse of the granule cell layer. The selective loss of neurons that normally govern lateral inhibition in the dentate gyrus may cause functional delamination of the granule cell layer and result in synchronous, multilamellar discharges in response to cortical stimuli. Repetitive seizures may ultimately produce the full pattern of hippocampal and mesial temporal sclerosis by destroying cells within the seizure circuit that were not injured irreversibly by the initial insult. Thus, hippocampal pathology may be both the cause and effect of seizures that originate in the temporal lobe.",

A number of features of the spontaneous seizures and of their ictal onset patterns can be analyzed from these recordings. We compared a number of the typical electroencephalographic (EEG) changes at seizure onset with several cellular parameters recorded in dentate granule cells from the same 14 patients diagnosed with medial temporal sclerosis (MTS) to examine the pathophysiological correlates of this spontaneous EEG activity in this form of TLE. The intracellularly recorded parameters include the propensity to fire evoked epileptiform bursts, the absence of evoked inhibitory potentials, the presence of polysynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and the presence of spontaneous excitatory activity. We noted several correlations between the EEG data and the intracellular recordings. The absence of synaptically evoked bursts was correlated with the presence of low-voltage fast activity at seizure onset. In addition, the loss of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials was correlated with the presence of periodic spiking pre-ictally. Several other correlations were also noted. These data indicate that EEG findings may be predictive of anatomical and cellular pathological changes and provide clues to the physiological mechanisms involved in this form of epilepsy.",

Previous studies in a well-established sheep model of status epilepticus showed that more than one-third of the unsedated animals died within 5 minutes of seizure onset due to hypoventilation. The relative contributions of airway obstruction and central hypoventilation could not be determined because airway flow and respiratory effort were not monitored. In this study, status epilepticus was induced in unsedated sheep with tracheostomies monitored by electrocardiography, electroencephalography, arterial line, serial blood gases, and airway flowmeter. All 8 animals demonstrated central apnea and hypoventilation, which resulted in the death of 1 and contributed to the death of another. A third animal died of acute heart failure within 2 minutes of seizure onset, accompanied by a large septal myocardial hemorrhage, contraction bands, and signs of global cardiac ischemia. More subtle contraction bands, subendocardial hemorrhage, and signs of acute myocardial ischemia were seen in other animals as well, none of which died of cardiac causes. Malignant arrhythmia was not seen in any of the sheep. Central hypoventilation and apnea accompany generalized status epilepticus and may be an important cause of sudden death in epileptics. Acute cardiac failure may also be a cause of epileptic sudden death.",

In 94\% of concordant MZ pairs, and 71\% of concordant DZ pairs, both twins had the same major epilepsy syndrome. When analyzed according to major epilepsy syndrome, the casewise concordances for generalized epilepsies (MZ = 0.82; DZ = 0.26), both idiopathic (MZ = 0.76; DZ = 0.33) and symptomatic (MZ = 0.83; DZ = 0), were greater than those for partial epilepsies (MZ = 0.36; DZ = 0.05), with intermediate values seen for febrile seizures (MZ = 0.58; DZ = 0.14) and unclassified epilepsies (MZ = 0.53; DZ = 0.18). We conclude that genetic factors are particularly important in the generalized epilepsies but also play a role in the partial epilepsies.

abstract = "Neurons in the rat nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) possess morphologic characteristics that have been correlated with the type of synaptic information they receive. These features have been described for viscerosensory neurons but not for premotor NTS neurons. The morphologic and synaptic features of neurons in the rat caudal NTS were assessed using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and biocytin labeling in brainstem slices. Gastric-related premotor NTS neurons were identified for recording after inoculation of the stomach wall with a transneuronal retrograde viral label that reports enhanced green fluorescent protein. Three morphologic groups of NTS neurons were identified based on quantitative aspects of soma area and proximal dendritic arborization, measures that were consistent across slice recordings. The most common type of cell (group I) had relatively small somata and one to three sparsely branching dendrites, whereas the other groups had larger somata and more than three dendrites, which branched predominantly close to (group II) or distant from (group III) the soma. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents in all neurons, regardless of morphology. Gastric-related premotor NTS neurons composed two of the three morphologic types (i.e., groups I and II). Compared with unlabeled neurons, these cells were less likely to receive constant-latency synaptic input from the tractus solitarius. These results refute the hypothesis that general patterns of synaptic input to NTS neurons depend on morphology. Gastric premotor neurons comprise a subset of NTS morphologic types, the organization of the viscerosensory input to which has yet to be defined.",

abstract = "The subiculum was recently shown to be crucially involved in the generation of interictal activity in human temporal lobe epilepsy. Using the pilocarpine model of epilepsy, this study examines the anatomical substrates for network hyperexcitability recorded in the subiculum. Regular- and burst-spiking subicular pyramidal cells were stained with fluorescence dyes and reconstructed to analyze seizure-induced alterations of the dendritic and axonal system. In control animals burst-spiking cells outnumbered regular-spiking cells by about two to one. Regular- and burst-spiking cells were characterized by extensive axonal branching and autapse-like contacts, suggesting a high intrinsic connectivity. In addition, subicular axons projecting to CA1 indicate a CA1-subiculum-CA1 circuit. In the subiculum of pilocarpine-treated rats we found an enhanced network excitability characterized by spontaneous rhythmic activity, polysynaptic responses, and all-or-none evoked bursts of action potentials. In pilocarpine-treated rats the subiculum showed cell loss of about 30\%. The ratio of regular- and burst-spiking cells was practically inverse as compared to control preparations. A reduced arborization and spine density in the proximal part of the apical dendrites suggests a partial deafferentiation from CA1. In pilocarpine-treated rats no increased axonal outgrowth of pyramidal cells was observed. Hence, axonal sprouting of subicular pyramidal cells is not mandatory for the development of the pathological events. We suggest that pilocarpine-induced seizures cause an unmasking or strengthening of synaptic contacts within the recurrent subicular network.",

Immunohistochemistry for somatostatin (SOM), neuropeptide Y (NPY), parvalbumin (PV), cholecystokinin (CCK), and Fluoro-Jade B was performed on sections from hippocampus contralateral to the stimulated side and studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Compared to paired age-matched control animals, there were fewer SOM and NPY-immunoreactive (IR) interneurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in animals with epilepsy (40-60 days after SE), and 1, 3, and 7 days following SE. In the hilus of animals that had recently undergone SE, some SOM-IR and NPY-IR interneurons also stained for Fluoro-Jade B. Furthermore, there was electron microscopic evidence of the degeneration of SOM-IR interneurons following SE. In contrast, the number of CCK and PV-IR basket cells in epileptic animals was similar to that in controls, although it was transiently diminished following SE; there was no evidence of degeneration of CCK or PV-IR interneurons. Patch-clamp recordings revealed a diminished frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents in dentate granule cells (DGCs) recorded from epileptic animals and animals that had recently undergone SE compared with controls. These results confirm the selective vulnerability of a particular subset of dentate hilar interneurons after prolonged SE. This loss may contribute to the reduced GABAergic synaptic inhibition of granule cells in epileptic animals.",

abstract = "Prolonged dentate granule cell discharges produce hippocampal injury and chronic epilepsy in rats. In preparing to study this epileptogenic process in genetically altered mice, we determined whether the background strain used to generate most genetically altered mice, the C57BL/6 mouse, is vulnerable to stimulation-induced seizure-induced injury. This was necessary because C57BL/6 mice are reportedly resistant to the neurotoxic effects of kainate-induced seizures, which we hypothesized to be related to strain differences in kainate's effects, rather than genetic differences in intrinsic neuronal vulnerability. Bilateral perforant pathway stimulation-induced granule cell discharge for 4 hours under urethane anesthesia produced degeneration of glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GluR2)-positive hilar mossy cells and peptide-containing interneurons in both FVB/N (kainate-vulnerable) and C57BL/6 (kainate-resistant) mice, indicating no strain differences in neuronal vulnerability to seizure activity. Granule cell discharge for 2 hours in C57BL/6 mice destroyed most GluR2-positive dentate hilar mossy cells, but not peptide-containing hilar interneurons, indicating that mossy cells are the neurons most vulnerable to this insult. Stimulation for 24 hours caused extensive hippocampal neuron loss and injury to the septum and entorhinal cortex, but no other detectable damage. Mice stimulated for 24 hours developed hippocampal sclerosis, granule cell mossy fiber sprouting, and chronic epilepsy, but not the granule cell layer hypertrophy (granule cell dispersion) produced by intrahippocampal kainate. These results demonstrate that perforant pathway stimulation in mice reliably reproduces the defining features of human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis. Experimental studies in transgenic or knockout mice are feasible if electrical stimulation is used to produce controlled epileptogenic insults.",

abstract = "Many patients with temporal lobe epilepsy display neuron loss in the dentate gyrus. One potential epileptogenic mechanism is loss of GABAergic interneurons and inhibitory synapses with granule cells. Stereological techniques were used to estimate numbers of gephyrin-positive punctae in the dentate gyrus, which were reduced short-term (5 days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus) but later rebounded beyond controls in epileptic rats. Stereological techniques were used to estimate numbers of synapses in electron micrographs of serial sections processed for postembedding GABA-immunoreactivity. Adjacent sections were used to estimate numbers of granule cells and glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons per dentate gyrus. GABAergic neurons were reduced to 70\% of control levels short-term, where they remained in epileptic rats. Integrating synapse and cell counts yielded average numbers of GABAergic synapses per granule cell, which decreased short-term and rebounded in epileptic animals beyond control levels. Axo-shaft and axo-spinous GABAergic synapse numbers in the outer molecular layer changed most. These findings suggest interneuron loss initially reduces numbers of GABAergic synapses with granule cells, but later, synaptogenesis by surviving interneurons overshoots control levels. In contrast, the average number of excitatory synapses per granule cell decreased short-term but recovered only toward control levels, although in epileptic rats excitatory synapses in the inner molecular layer were larger than in controls. These findings reveal a relative excess of GABAergic synapses and suggest that reports of reduced functional inhibitory synaptic input to granule cells in epilepsy might be attributable not to fewer but instead to abundant but dysfunctional GABAergic synapses.

abstract = "In refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, seizures often arise from a shrunken hippocampus exhibiting a pattern of selective neuron loss called ``classic hippocampal sclerosis.'' No single experimental injury has reproduced this specific pathology, suggesting that hippocampal atrophy might be a progressive ``endstage'' pathology resulting from years of spontaneous seizures. We posed the alternative hypothesis that classic hippocampal sclerosis results from a single excitatory event that has never been successfully modeled experimentally because convulsive status epilepticus, the insult most commonly used to produce epileptogenic brain injury, is too severe and necessarily terminated before the hippocampus receives the needed duration of excitation. We tested this hypothesis by producing prolonged hippocampal excitation in awake rats without causing convulsive status epilepticus. Two daily 30-minute episodes of perforant pathway stimulation in Sprague--Dawley rats increased granule cell paired-pulse inhibition, decreased epileptiform afterdischarge durations during 8 hours of subsequent stimulation, and prevented convulsive status epilepticus. Similarly, one 8-hour episode of reduced-intensity stimulation in Long--Evans rats, which are relatively resistant to developing status epilepticus, produced hippocampal discharges without causing status epilepticus. Both paradigms immediately produced the extensive neuronal injury that defines classic hippocampal sclerosis, without giving any clinical indication during the insult that an injury was being inflicted. Spontaneous hippocampal-onset seizures began 16--25 days postinjury, before hippocampal atrophy developed, as demonstrated by sequential magnetic resonance imaging. These results indicate that classic hippocampal sclerosis is uniquely produced by a single episode of clinically ``cryptic'' excitation. Epileptogenic insults may often involve prolonged excitation that goes undetected at the time of injury. J. Comp. Neurol. 518:3381--3407, 2010. \copyright{} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Neurons immunoreactive for cholera toxin B (CTB-ir), retrogradely transported from the RVLM, were assessed for expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) or preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA using in situ hybridization. GAD67 mRNA was expressed in CTB-ir neurons in the following regions: the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS, 6\% of CTB-ir neurons), area postrema (AP, 8\%), caudal ventrolateral medulla (17\%), midline raphe (40\%), ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VLPAG, 15\%), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA, 25\%), central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA, 77\%), sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA, 86\%), interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure (IPAC, 56\%), bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST, 59\%), and medial preoptic area (MPA, 53\%).

This review is an attempt to discuss equivalencies and extent of the five subicular components in human, monkey, and rodent based on available information on their cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, molecular signature, and neural connectivity. All five subicular cortices exist in human, monkey, and rodent. In human and monkey, the ProS and Sub extend into the uncal region anteriorly, and the PoS and PaS reach the cingulate isthmus posteriorly. In rodent, most of the typical subicular cortices are located in the dorsal and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation, and the modified version of the ventral ProS and Sub corresponds to the modified description of the uncal ProS and Sub in monkey and human. An interesting triangular region in rodent located at the juncture of the PoS, PaS, retrosplenial cortex, and visual cortex appears to be the equivalent of the monkey area prostriata. Major connections of the five subicular cortices are also summarized based on unified criteria discussed in this review, with distinct connections revealed between the ProS and the Sub.",

abstract = "Regulation of BNSTALG neuronal firing activity is tightly regulated by the opposing actions of the fast outward potassium current, IA , mediated by $\alpha$ subunits of the Kv4 family of ion channels, and the transient inward calcium current, IT . Together, these channels play a critical role in regulating the latency to action potential onset, duration, and frequency, as well as dendritic back-propagation and synaptic plasticity. Previously we have shown that Type I-III BNSTALG neurons express mRNA transcripts for each of the Kv4 $\alpha$ subunits. However, the biophysical properties of native IA channels are critically dependent on the formation of macromolecular complexes of Kv4 channels with a family of chaperone proteins, the potassium channel-interacting proteins (KChIP1-4). Here we used a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the expression and function of Kv4 channels and KChIPs in neurons of the rat BNSTALG . Using immunofluorescence we demonstrated the pattern of localization of Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and KChIP1-4 proteins in the BNSTALG . Moreover, our single-cell reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (scRT-PCR) studies revealed that mRNA transcripts for Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and all four KChIPs were differentially expressed in Type I-III BNSTALG neurons. Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 channels were primarily localized to the dendrites and spines of BNSTALG neurons, and are thus ideally situated to modulate synaptic transmission. Consistent with this observation, in vitro patch clamp recordings showed that reducing postsynaptic IA in these neurons lowered the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. These results are discussed in relation to potential modulation of IA channels by chronic stress.",

abstract = "Inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway with rapamycin blocks granule cell axon (mossy fiber) sprouting after epileptogenic injuries, including pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. However, it remains unclear whether axons from other types of neurons sprout into the inner molecular layer and synapse with granule cell dendrites despite rapamycin treatment. If so, other aberrant positive-feedback networks might develop. To test this possibility stereological electron microscopy was used to estimate the numbers of excitatory synapses in the inner molecular layer per hippocampus in pilocarpine-treated control mice, in mice 5 days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, and after status epilepticus and daily treatment beginning 24 hours later with rapamycin or vehicle for 2 months. The optical fractionator method was used to estimate numbers of granule cells in Nissl-stained sections so that numbers of excitatory synapses in the inner molecular layer per granule cell could be calculated. Control mice had an average of 2,280 asymmetric synapses in the inner molecular layer per granule cell, which was reduced to 63\% of controls 5 days after status epilepticus, recovered to 93\% of controls in vehicle-treated mice 2 months after status epilepticus, but remained at only 63\% of controls in rapamycin-treated mice. These findings reveal that rapamycin prevented excitatory axons from synapsing with proximal dendrites of granule cells and raise questions about the recurrent excitation hypothesis of temporal lobe epilepsy.",

It contains a collection of subnuclei delineated by gross cytoarchitecture features; however, there has yet to be a systematic examination of specific BNST neuronal types and their associated neurochemical makeup. The present study focuses on improved characterization of the anterior BNST based on differing molecular and chemical expression aided by mouse genetics. Specific Cre driver lines crossed with a fluorescent reporter line were used for genetic cell targeting and immunochemical staining. Using this new approach, we were able to robustly identify specific excitatory and inhibitory cell types in the BNST. The presence and distribution of excitatory neurons were firmly established; glutamatergic neurons in the anterior BNST accounted for about 14\% and 31\% of dorsal and ventral BNST cells, respectively. GABAergic neurons expressing different isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase were found to have differential subregional distributions. Almost no parvalbumin-expressing cells were found in the BNST, while somatostatin-expressing cells and calretinin-expressing cells account for modest proportions of BNST cells. In addition, vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing axonal plexuses were prominent in the oval and juxtacapsular subregions. In addition, we discovered that corticotropin-releasing hormone-expressing cells contain GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Together, this study reveals new information on excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the BNST, which will facilitate genetic dissection and functional studies of BNST subregions. J. Comp.

abstract = "Epilepsy occurs in one of 26 people. Temporal lobe epilepsy is common and can be difficult to treat effectively. It can develop after brain injuries that damage the hippocampus. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms involving the hippocampal dentate gyrus have been proposed. The present study evaluated a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy to test which pathological changes in the dentate gyrus correlate with seizure frequency and help prioritize potential mechanisms for further study. FVB mice (n = 127) that had experienced status epilepticus after systemic treatment with pilocarpine 31 - 61 d earlier were video-monitored for spontaneous, convulsive seizures 9 h/d every day for 24 - 36 d. Over 4060 seizures were observed. Seizure frequency ranged from an average of one every 3.6 d to one every 2.1 h. Hippocampal sections were processed for Nissl stain, Prox1-immunocytochemistry, Timm stain, GFAP-immunocytochemistry, GAD in situ hybridization, and parvalbumin-immunocytochemistry. Stereological methods were used to measure hilar ectopic granule cells, mossy fiber sprouting, astrogliosis, and GABAergic interneurons. Seizure frequency was not significantly correlated with the generation of hilar ectopic granule cells, the extent of mossy fiber sprouting, the extent of astrogliosis, the number of mossy cells, or the number of GABAergic interneurons in the molecular layer or hilus. Seizure frequency significantly correlated with the loss of GABAergic interneurons in or adjacent to the granule cell layer, but not with the loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons. These findings prioritize the loss of granule cell layer interneurons for further testing as a potential cause of temporal lobe epilepsy. This article is protected by copyright.

Excitatory preB{\"o}tC neurons in rats project to major breathing-related brainstem regions. Here, we provide a brainstem connectivity map in mice for both excitatory and inhibitory preB{\"o}tC neurons. Using a genetic strategy to label preB{\"o}tC neurons, we confirmed extensive projections of preB{\"o}tC excitatory neurons within the brainstem breathing CPG including the contralateral preB{\"o}tC, B{\"o}tzinger Complex (B{\"o}tC), ventral respiratory group (VRG), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), parahypoglossal nucleus, parafacial region (RTN/pFRG or alternatively, pFL/pFV), parabrachial and K{\"o}lliker-F{\"u}se nuclei, as well as major projections to the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). Interestingly, preB{\"o}tC inhibitory projections paralleled the excitatory projections. Moreover, we examined overlapping projections in the pons in detail and found that they targeted the same neurons. We further explored the direct anatomical link between the preB{\"o}tC and suprapontine brain regions that may govern emotion and other complex behaviors that can affect or be affected by breathing. Forebrain efferent projections were sparse and restricted to specific nuclei within the thalamus and hypothalamus, with processes rarely observed in cortex, basal ganglia, or other limbic regions, e.g., amygdala or hippocampus. We conclude that the preB{\"o}tC sends direct, presumably inspiratory-modulated, excitatory and inhibitory projections in parallel to distinct targets throughout the brain that generate and modulate breathing pattern and/or coordinate breathing with other behaviors, physiology, cognition, or emotional state.

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a critical node involved in stress and reward-related behaviours. Relaxin family peptide 3 receptor (RXFP3) signalling in the BNST has been implicated in stress-induced alcohol seeking behaviour. However, the neurochemical phenotype and connectivity of BNST RXFP3-expressing (RXFP3+) cells have yet to be elucidated. We interrogated the molecular signature and electrophysiological properties of BNST RXFP3+ neurons using a RXFP3-Cre reporter mouse line. BNST RXFP3+ cells are circumscribed to the dorsal BNST (dBNST) and are neurochemically heterogeneous, comprising a mix of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ~48\% of BNST RXFP3+ neurons are GABAergic, and a quarter of these co-express the calcium-binding protein, calbindin. A subset of BNST RXFP3+ cells (~41\%) co-express CaMKII$\alpha$, suggesting this subpopulation of BNST RXFP3+ neurons are excitatory. Corroborating this, RNAscope\textregistered{} revealed that ~35\% of BNST RXFP3+ cells express vVGluT2 mRNA, indicating a subpopulation of RXFP3+ neurons are glutamatergic. RXFP3+ neurons show direct hyperpolarisation to bath application of a selective RXFP3 agonist, RXFP3-A2, while around 50\% of cells were depolarised by exogenous corticotrophin releasing factor. In behaviourally naive mice the majority of RXFP3+ neurons were type II cells exhibiting Ih and T type calcium mediated currents. However, chronic swim stress caused persistent plasticity, decreasing the proportion of neurons that express these channels. These studies are the first to characterise the BNST RXFP3 system in mouse and lay the foundation for future functional studies appraising the role of the murine BNST RXFP3 system in more complex behaviours.

It is also the brain's primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top-down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain-wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone-sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS-projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express Slc17a6/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express Slc32a1/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington's nucleus, K{\"o}lliker-Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral ``mind-body'' symptoms.",

title = "Regulation of breathing and autonomic outflows by chemoreceptors",
author = "Guyenet, Patrice G",
abstract = "Lung ventilation fluctuates widely with behavior but arterial PCO2 remains stable. Under normal conditions, the chemoreflexes contribute to PaCO2 stability by producing small corrective cardiorespiratory adjustments mediated by lower brainstem circuits. Carotid body (CB) information reaches the respiratory pattern generator (RPG) via nucleus solitarius (NTS) glutamatergic neurons which also target rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) presympathetic neurons thereby raising sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). Chemoreceptors also regulate presympathetic neurons and cardiovagal preganglionic neurons indirectly via inputs from the RPG. Secondary effects of chemoreceptors on the autonomic outflows result from changes in lung stretch afferent and baroreceptor activity. Central respiratory chemosensitivity is caused by direct effects of acid on neurons and indirect effects of CO2 via astrocytes. Central respiratory chemoreceptors are not definitively identified but the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a particularly strong candidate. The absence of RTN likely causes severe central apneas in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Like other stressors, intense chemosensory stimuli produce arousal and activate circuits that are wake- or attention-promoting. Such pathways (e.g., locus coeruleus, raphe, and orexin system) modulate the chemoreflexes in a state-dependent manner and their activation by strong chemosensory stimuli intensifies these reflexes. In essential hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea and congestive heart failure, chronically elevated CB afferent activity contributes to raising SNA but breathing is unchanged or becomes periodic (severe CHF). Extreme CNS hypoxia produces a stereotyped cardiorespiratory response (gasping, increased SNA). The effects of these various pathologies on brainstem cardiorespiratory networks are discussed, special consideration being given to the interactions between central and peripheral chemoreflexes.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and cause substantial suffering and impairment. Whereas the amygdala has well-established contributions to anxiety, evidence from rodent and nonhuman primate models suggests that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) may play a critical, and possibly distinct, role in human anxiety disorders. The BNST mediates hypervigilance and anticipatory anxiety in response to an unpredictable or ambiguous threat, core symptoms of social anxiety, yet little is known about the BNST's role in social anxiety. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure neural responses during a cued anticipation task with an unpredictable, predictable threat, and predictable neutral cues followed by threat or neutral images. Social anxiety was examined using a dimensional approach (N = 44 adults). RESULTS: For unpredictable cues, higher social anxiety was associated with lower BNST-amygdala connectivity. For unpredictable images, higher social anxiety was associated with greater connectivity between the BNST and both the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex and lower connectivity between the BNST and postcentral gyrus. Social anxiety moderated the BNST-amygdala dissociation for unpredictable images; higher social anxiety was associated with BNST > amygdala response to unpredictable threat relative to unpredictable neutral images. CONCLUSIONS: Social anxiety was associated with alterations in BNST responses to unpredictability, particularly in the BNST's interactions with other brain regions, including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first evidence for the BNST's role in social anxiety, which may be a potential new target for prevention and intervention.",

author = "Hamed, Sherifa A",
abstract = "Epilepsy is a common neurological disease. A growing number of research studies provide evidence regarding the progressive neuronal damage induced by prolonged seizures or status epilepticus (SE), as well as recurrent brief seizures. Importantly, seizure is only one aspect of epilepsy. However, cognitive and behavioral deficits induced by progressive seizures or antiepileptic treatment can be detrimental to individual function. The neurobiology of epilepsy is poorly understood involving complex cellular and molecular mechanisms. The brain undergoes changes in its basic structure and function, e.g., neural plasticity with an increased susceptibility in neuronal synchronization and network circuit alterations. Some of these changes are transient, while others are permanent with an involvement of both glutamatergic and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic systems. Recent data suggest that impaired neuronal plasticity may underlie the cognitive impairment and behavioral changes associated with epilepsy. Many neurologists recognize that the prevention or suppression of seizures by the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) alone is insufficient without clear predictions of disease outcome. Hence, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis because this may allow the development of innovative strategies to prevent or cure this condition. In addition, this realization would have significant impact in reducing the long-term adverse consequences of the disease, including neurocognitive and behavioral adverse effects.

The advances in genetics have identified genes that control the development, maturation and integration of GABAergic interneurons and implicated them in the pathogenesis of epileptic encephalopathies or neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, mutations of the Aristaless-Related homeobox X-linked gene (ARX) may result in defective GABAergic interneuronal migration in infants with epileptic encephalopathies like West syndrome (WS), Ohtahara syndrome or X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG). The concept of ``interneuronopathy'', i.e. impaired development, migration or function of interneurons, has emerged as a possible etiopathogenic mechanism for epileptic encephalopathies. Treatments that enhance GABA levels, may help seizure control but do not necessarily show disease modifying effect. On the other hand, interneuronopathies can be seen in other conditions in which epilepsy may not be the primary manifestation, such as autism. In this review, we plan to outline briefly the current state of knowledge on the origin, development, and migration and integration of GABAergic interneurons, present neurodevelopmental conditions, with or without epilepsy, that have been associated with interneuronopathies and discuss the evidence linking certain types of interneuronal dysfunction with epilepsy and/or cognitive or behavioral deficits.",

abstract = "The revolution in theory, swift technological developments, and invention of new devices have driven tremendous progress in neurostimulation as a third-line treatment for epilepsy. Over the past decades, neurostimulation took its place in the field of epilepsy as an advanced treatment technique and opened up a new world. Numerous animal studies have proven the physical efficacy of stimulation of the brain and peripheral nerves. Based on this optimistic fundamental research, new advanced techniques are being explored in clinical practice. Over the past century, drawing on the benefits brought about by vagus nerve stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy, various new neurostimulation modalities have been developed to control seizures. Clinical studies including case reports, case series, and clinical trials have been booming in the past several years. This article gives a comprehensive review of most of these clinical studies. In addition to highlighting the advantages of neurostimulation for the treatment of epilepsy, concerns with this modality and future development directions are also discussed. The biggest advantage of neurostimulation over pharmacological treatments for epilepsy is the modulation of the epilepsy network by delivering stimuli at a specific target or the ``hub.'' Conversely, however, a lack of knowledge of epilepsy networks and the mechanisms of neurostimulation may hinder further development. Therefore, theoretical research on the mechanism of epileptogenesis and epilepsy networks is needed in the future. Within the multiple modalities of neuromodulation, the final choice should be made after full discussion with a multidisciplinary team at a presurgical conference. Furthermore, the establishment of a neurostimulation system with standardized parameters and rigorous guidelines is another important issue. To achieve this goal, a worldwide collaboration of epilepsy centers is also suggested in the future.",

All 4 patients presented with explosive onset of seizures and developed medically intractable epilepsy, and 2 exhibited a marked response to immunotherapy. Associated features included cognitive and behavioral disturbances (4/4), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis (3/4), and a neural autoantibody (2/4). Electroencephalogram (EEG) features consisted of slow wave activity and epileptiform discharges in frontal and parasagittal regions, where ictal patterns were captured in 1 patient. In 1 patient, magnetoencephalographic source imaging of interictal spikes revealed dipole sources in anterior insular or subinsular localizations, mirroring claustrum FLAIR hyperintensities, which developed after a short lag from presentation and resolved in all but 1 patient. These MRI abnormalities were isolated (2/4) or associated with mesial temporal hyperintensities (2/4). Claustrum FLAIR hyperintensities may be a useful MRI marker of autoimmune epilepsy.",

The majority of witnessed cases are reported to be preceded by a convulsive seizure and postictal hypoventilation. Here, we report an 8-year-old girl with drug-resistant focal seizures secondary to a focal cortical dysplasia type IIb. While undergoing invasive intracranial monitoring with subdural and depth electrodes, she had a clinical apnea event recorded on video, followed by bradycardia, which required resuscitation. Her intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) during the event showed diffuse slowing and attenuation of cortical activity, with bradycardia that responded to positive pressure ventilation with oxygen. This near SUDEP event was not preceded by either an electroclinical or electrographic seizure. This is the first report of a witnessed, near-SUDEP event during intracranial monitoring. It emphasizes the fact that near-SUDEP can occur without a preceding seizure.",

On average, cases of PNES + ES died at a younger age (23 $\pm$ 11 years) than the ES-only cohort (30 $\pm$ 14 years), and died an average of 3 years after PNES diagnosis. We found no statistically significant confounding cardiac, respiratory, or psychiatric comorbidities and equal rates of anti-seizure medication adherence, although there was a trend for higher rates of psychiatric disorders in the PNES group. Our findings confirm that patients with comorbid ES and PNES can die from SUDEP and that there may be a high-risk period after the diagnosis of PNES is made in patients with comorbid ES. Such patients should be closely monitored and provided with coordinated care of both their epilepsy and psychiatric disorder(s).",

abstract = "Glial glutamate transporter GLT1 plays a key role in the maintenance of extracellular glutamate homeostasis. Recent human genetic studies have suggested that de novo mutations in GLT1 (EAAT2) cause early-onset epilepsy with multiple seizure types. Consistent with these findings, global GLT1 null mice show lethal spontaneous seizures. The consequences of GLT1 dysfunction vary between different brain regions, suggesting that the role of GLT1 dysfunction in epilepsy may also vary with brain regions. In this study, we generated region-specific GLT1 knockout mice by crossing floxed-GLT1 mice with mice that express the Cre recombinase in a particular domain of the ventricular zone. Selective deletion of GLT1 in the diencephalon, brainstem and spinal cord is sufficient to reproduce the phenotypes (excess mortality, decreased body weight, and lethal spontaneous seizure) of the global GLT1 null mice. By contrast, dorsal forebrain-specific GLT1 knockout mice showed nonlethal complex seizures including myoclonic jerks, hyperkinetic running, spasm and clonic convulsion via the activation of NMDA receptors during a limited period from P12 to P14 and selective neuronal death in cortical layer II/III and the hippocampus. Thus, GLT1 dysfunction in the dorsal forebrain is involved in the pathogenesis of infantile epilepsy and GLT1 in the diencephalon, brainstem and spinal cord may play a critical role in preventing seizure-induced sudden death.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to explore the functional connectivity between the insula and other cortical regions, in human, using cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed intra-cerebral electrical stimulation in eleven patients with refractory epilepsy investigated with depth electrodes, including 39 targeting the insula. Electrical stimulation consisted of two series of 20 pulses of 1-ms duration, 0.2-Hz frequency, and 1-mA intensity delivered at each of the 39 insular bipoles. Rates of connectivity were reported whenever a noninsular cortical region was tested by at least ten stimulating/recording electrode pairs in three or more patients RESULTS: Significant CCEPs were elicited in 193 of the 578 (33\%) tested connections, with an average latency of 33 $\pm$ 5 ms. The highest connectivity rates were observed with the nearby perisylvian structures (59\%), followed by the pericentral cortex (38\%), the temporal neocortex (28\%), the lateral parietal cortex (26\%), the orbitofrontal cortex (25\%), the mesial temporal structures (24\%), the dorsolateral frontal cortex (15\%), the temporal pole (14\%), and the mesial parietal cortex (11\%). No connectivity was detected in the mesial frontal cortex or cingulate gyrus. The pattern of connectivity also differed between the five insular gyri, with greater connectivity rate for the posterior short gyrus (49\%), than for the middle short (29\%), and two long gyri (28 and 33\%) CONCLUSION: The human insula is characterized by a rich and complex connectivity that varies as a function of the insular gyrus and appears to partly differ from the efferences described in nonhuman primates.",

Its small size and connection to other small regions prevents standard imaging techniques from easily capturing it and its connectivity with confidence. Seed-based resting state functional connectivity is an established method for mapping functional connections across the brain from a region of interest. We, therefore, mapped the BNST resting state network with high spatial resolution using 7 Tesla fMRI, demonstrating the in vivo reproduction of many human BNST connections previously described only in animal research. We identify strong BNST functional connectivity in amygdala, hippocampus and thalamic subregions, caudate, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, and cortical areas such as the medial PFC and precuneus. This work, which demonstrates the power of ultra-high field for mapping functional connections in the human, is an important step toward elucidating cortical and subcortical regions and subregions of the BNST network.",

abstract = "Several lines of evidence suggest that the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are differentially involved in phasic and sustained fear. Even though, results from neuroimaging studies support this distinction, a specific effect of a temporal dissociation with phasic responses to onset versus sustained responses during prolonged states of threat anticipation has not been shown yet. To explore this issue, we investigated brain activation during anticipation of threat in 38 healthy participants by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were presented different visual cues indicated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of a subsequent aversive or neutral stimulus. During the onset of aversive versus neutral anticipatory cues, results showed a differential phasic activation of amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). In contrast, activation in the BNST and other brain regions, including insula, dorsolateral PFC, ACC, cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and periaqueductal grey was characterized by a sustained response during the threat versus neutral anticipation period. Analyses of functional connectivity showed phasic amygdala response as positively associated with activation, mainly in sensory cortex areas whereas sustained BNST activation was negatively associated with activation in visual cortex and positively correlated with activation in the insula and thalamus. These findings suggest that the amygdala is responsive to the onset of cues signaling the unpredictable occurrence of a potential threat while the BNST in concert with other areas is involved in sustained anxiety.

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST) is a subcortical structure involved in anticipatory and sustained reactivity to threat and is thus essential to the understanding of anxiety and stress responses. Although chronic stress and anxiety represent a hallmark of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to date, few studies have examined the functional connectivity of the BNST in PTSD. Here, we used resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to investigate the functional connectivity of the BNST in PTSD (n = 70), its dissociative subtype (PTSD + DS) (n = 41), and healthy controls (n = 50). In comparison to controls, PTSD showed increased functional connectivity of the BNST with regions of the reward system (ventral and dorsal striatum), possibly underlying stress-induced reward-seeking behaviors in PTSD. By contrast, comparing PTSD + DS to controls, we observed increased functional connectivity of the BNST with the claustrum, a brain region implicated in consciousness and a primary site of kappa-opioid receptors, which are critical to the dynorphin-mediated dysphoric stress response. Moreover, PTSD + DS showed increased functional connectivity of the BNST with brain regions involved in attention and salience detection (anterior insula and caudate nucleus) as compared to PTSD and controls. Finally, BNST functional connectivity positively correlated with default-mode network regions as a function of state identity dissociation, suggesting a role of BNST networks in the disruption of self-relevant processing characterizing the dissociative subtype. These findings represent an important first step in elucidating the role of the BNST in aberrant functional networks underlying PTSD and its dissociative subtype.",

abstract = "Observations in witnessed Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) suggest that a fatal breakdown of the central autonomic control could play a major role in SUDEP. A previous MR study found volume losses in the mesencephalon in focal epilepsy that were more severe and extended into the lower brainstem in two patients who later died of SUDEP. The aims of this study were to demonstrate an association (1) between brainstem volume loss and impaired autonomic control (reduced heart rate variability [HRV]); (2) between brainstem damage and time to SUDEP in patients who later died of SUDEP. Two populations were studied: (1) Autonomic system function population (ASF, 18 patients with focal epilepsy, 11 controls) with HRV measurements and standardized 3 T MR exams. (2) SUDEP population (26 SUDEP epilepsy patients) with clinical MRI 1-10 years before SUDEP. Deformation-based morphometry of the brainstem was used to generate profile similarity maps from the resulting Jacobian determinant maps that were further characterized by graph analysis to identify regions with excessive expansion indicating significant volume loss or atrophy. The total number of regions with excessive expansion in ASF was negatively correlated with HRV (r = -.37, p = .03), excessive volume loss in periaqueductal gray/medulla oblongata autonomic nuclei explained most of the HRV associated variation (r/r2 = -.82/.67, p < .001). The total number of regions with excessive expansion in SUDEP was negatively correlated with time to SUDEP (r = -.39, p = .03), excessive volume loss in the raphe/medulla oblongata at the obex level explained most of the variation of the time between MRI to SUDEP (r/r2 = -.60/.35,p = .001). Epilepsy is associated with brainstem atrophy that impairs autonomic control and can increase the risk for SUDEP if it expands into the mesencephalon.",

Although previous research provided deeper insight into the structural and functional connections between these nuclei, studies investigating their resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity were solely based on undirected connectivity measures. Here, we used high-quality data of 391 subjects from the Human Connectome Project to estimate the effective connectivity (EC) between the BNST, the LB, CM, and SF through spectral dynamic causal modeling, the relation of the EC estimates with age and sex as well as their stability over time. Our results reveal a time-stable asymmetric EC structure with positive EC between all amygdala nuclei, which strongly inhibited the BNST while the BNST exerted positive influence onto all amygdala nuclei. Simulation of the impulse response of the estimated system showed that this EC structure shapes partially antagonistic (out of phase) activity flow between the BNST and amygdala nuclei. Moreover, the BNST-LB and BNST-CM EC parameters were less negative in males. In conclusion, our data points toward partially separated information processing between BNST and amygdala nuclei in the resting-state.",

abstract = "Patients with epilepsy are often able to predict seizure occurrence subsequent to an acute stress experience. However, neuroimaging investigations into the neural basis of this relationship or the potential influence of perceived life stress are limited. The current study assessed the relationship between perceived stress and the neurobehavioral response to stress in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE) and healthy controls (HCs) using heart rate, salivary cortisol level, and functional magnetic resonance imaging and compared these effects between HCs and LTLE. Matched on perceived stress levels, groups of 36 patients with LTLE and 36 HCs completed the Montreal Imaging Stress Task, with control and stress math task conditions. Among LTLEs, 27 reported that prior (acute) stress affected their seizures (LTLES+), while nine did not (LTLES-). The results revealed that increased perceived stress was associated with seizure frequency in LTLE. Further, cortisol secretion was greater in LTLE, but did not vary with perceived stress as observed in HCs. A linear mixed-effects analysis revealed that as perceived stress increased, activation in the hippocampal complex (parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus) decreased during stressful math in the LTLES+, increased in HCs, but did not vary in the LTLES-. Task-based functional connectivity analyses revealed LTLE differences in hippocampal functional connectivity with sensory cortex specific to stressor modalities. We argue that the current study demonstrates an inhibitory hippocampal mechanism underlying differences in resilience to stress between HCs and LTLE, as well as LTLE patients who report stress as a precipitant of seizures.",

abstract = "Seizures induced by fever (febrile seizures) are the most frequent seizures affecting infants and children; however, their impact on the developing hippocampal formation is not completely understood. Such understanding is highly important because of the potential relationship of prolonged febrile seizures to temporal lobe epilepsy. Using an immature rat model, we have previously demonstrated that prolonged experimental febrile seizures render the hippocampus hyperexcitable throughout life. Here we examined whether (1) neuronal loss, (2) altered neurogenesis, or (3) mossy fiber sprouting, all implicated in epileptogenesis in both animal models and humans, were involved in the generation of a pro-epileptic, hyperexcitable hippocampus by these seizures. The results demonstrated that prolonged experimental febrile seizures did not result in appreciable loss of any vulnerable hippocampal cell population, though causing strikingly enhanced sensitivity to hippocampal excitants later in life. In addition, experimental febrile seizures on postnatal day 10 did not enhance proliferation of granule cells, whereas seizures generated by kainic acid during the same developmental age increased neurogenesis in the immature hippocampus. However, prolonged febrile seizures resulted in long-term axonal reorganization in the immature hippocampal formation: Mossy fiber densities in granule cell- and molecular layers were significantly increased by 3 months (but not 10 days) after the seizures. Thus, the data indicate that prolonged febrile seizures influence connectivity of the immature hippocampus long-term, and this process requires neither significant neuronal loss nor altered neurogenesis. In addition, the temporal course of the augmented mossy fiber invasion of the granule cell and molecular layers suggests that it is a consequence, rather than the cause, of the hyperexcitable hippocampal network resulting from these seizures.",

Subicular neurons in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (EC) slices of epileptic rats were: (i) hyperexcitable when activated by CA1 or EC inputs; and (ii) generated spontaneous postsynaptic potentials at higher frequencies than NEC cells. Analysis of pharmacologically isolated, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials revealed more positive reversal potentials in epileptic tissue (-67.8 +/- 6.3 mV, n = 16 vs. -74.8 +/- 3.6 mV in NEC, n = 13; P < 0.001) combined with a reduction in peak conductance (17.6 +/- 11.3 nS vs. 41.1 +/- 26.7 nS in NEC; P < 0.003).

Full transections of the dentate gyrus and hilus were performed in the transverse axis at 22 days after KA injection when spontaneous HPD were fully developed.

abstract = "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of partial epilepsy and affects 40\% of the patients. Seizures arising from the mesial temporal lobe structures (i.e., amygdala and hippocampus) are common, whereas neocortical seizures are rare. In recent years, many studies aimed to identify the pattern of gene expression of neurotransmitters involved in molecular mechanisms of epilepsy. We used real-time PCR to quantify the expression of GABAA (subunits $\alpha$1, $\beta$1, $\beta$2) and NMDA (subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) receptor genes in amygdalae of 27 patients with TLE and 14 amygdalae from autopsy controls. The NR1 subunit was increased in patients with epilepsy when compared with controls. No differences were found in expression of NMDA subunits NR2A and NR2B or in $\alpha$1, $\beta$1, and $\beta$2 subunits of GABAA receptors. Our results suggest that the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors is involved in the amygdala hyperexcitability in some of the patients with TLE. \copyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Inc.",

author = "Singh, Shatrunjai P and He, Xiaoping and McNamara, James O and Danzer, Steve C",
abstract = "Temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with changes in the morphology of hippocampal dentate granule cells. These changes are evident in numerous models that are associated with substantial neuron loss and spontaneous recurrent seizures. By contrast, previous studies have shown that in the kindling model, it is possible to administer a limited number of stimulations sufficient to produce a lifelong enhanced sensitivity to stimulus evoked seizures without associated spontaneous seizures and minimal neuronal loss. Here we examined whether stimulation of the amygdala sufficient to evoke five convulsive seizures (class IV or greater on Racine's scale) produce morphological changes similar to those observed in models of epilepsy associated with substantial cell loss. The morphology of GFP-expressing granule cells from Thy-1 GFP mice was examined either 1 day or 1 month after the last evoked seizure. Interestingly, significant reductions in dendritic spine density were evident 1 day after the last seizure, the magnitude of which had diminished by 1 month. Further, there was an increase in the thickness of the granule cell layer 1 day after the last evoked seizure, which was absent a month later. We also observed an increase in the area of the proximal axon, which again returned to control levels a month later. No differences in the number of basal dendrites were detected at either time point. These findings demonstrate that the early stages of kindling epileptogenesis produce transient changes in the granule cell body layer thickness, molecular layer spine density, and axon proximal area, but do not produce striking rearrangements of granule cell structure.",

abstract = "Although there are many types of epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is probably in humans the most common and most often studied. TLE represents 40\% of the total epilepsy form of the disease and is difficult to treat. Despite a wealth of descriptive data obtained from the disease history of patients, the EEG recording, imaging techniques, and histological studies, the epileptogenic process remains poorly understood. However, it is unlikely that a single factor or a single mechanism can cause many changes associated with this neuropathological phenomenon. MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) coupled to protein identification, because of its ability to study a wide range of molecules, appears to be suitable for the preparation of molecular profiles in TLE. Seven neuropeptides have been have been identified in Dental gyrus regions of the hippocampus in relation with TLE pathology. Shot-gun studies taking into account gender influence have been performed. Tissue microextraction from control (10) toward 10 TLE patients have been analyzed after trypsin digestion followed by separation on nanoLC coupled to LTQ orbitrap. From the shot-gun analyses, results confirmed the presence of specific neuropeptides precursors and receptors in TLE patients as well as proteins involved in axons regeneration including neurotrophins, ECM proteins, cell surface proteins, membrane proteins, G-proteins, cytoskeleton proteins and tumor suppressors. Among the tumor suppressors identified, the Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) protein was found. LGI1 gene recently been demonstrated being implicated in heritability of TLE. We have also demonstrate the presence a complete profile of tumor suppressors in TLE patients, 7 have been identified. Refining this analysis taken into account the gender influence in both control and in TLE reflected the presence of specific proteins between male and female and thus mechanisms in pathology development could be completely different.",

author = "Zhang, Wei and Thamattoor, Ajoy K and LeRoy, Christopher and Buckmaster, Paul S",
abstract = "Numerous hypotheses of temporal lobe epileptogenesis have been proposed, and several involve hippocampal mossy cells. Building on previous hypotheses we sought to test the possibility that after epileptogenic injuries surviving mossy cells develop into super-connected seizure-generating hub cells. If so, they might require more cellular machinery and consequently have larger somata, elongate their dendrites to receive more synaptic input, and display higher frequencies of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs). To test these possibilities pilocarpine-treated mice were evaluated using GluR2-immunocytochemistry, whole-cell recording, and biocytin-labeling. Epileptic pilocarpine-treated mice displayed substantial loss of GluR2-positive hilar neurons. Somata of surviving neurons were 1.4-times larger than in controls. Biocytin-labeled mossy cells also were larger in epileptic mice, but dendritic length per cell was not significantly different. The average frequency of mEPSCs of mossy cells recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin and bicuculline was 3.2-times higher in epileptic pilocarpine-treated mice as compared to controls. Other parameters of mEPSCs were similar in both groups. Average input resistance of mossy cells in epileptic mice was reduced to 63\% of controls, which is consistent with larger somata and would tend to make surviving mossy cells less excitable. Other intrinsic physiological characteristics examined were similar in both groups. Increased excitatory synaptic input is consistent with the hypothesis that surviving mossy cells develop into aberrantly super-connected seizure-generating hub cells, and soma hypertrophy is indirectly consistent with the possibility of axon sprouting. However, no obvious evidence of hyperexcitable intrinsic physiology was found. Furthermore, similar hypertrophy and hyper-connectivity has been reported for other neuron types in the dentate gyrus, suggesting mossy cells are not unique in this regard. Thus, findings of the present study reveal epilepsy-related changes in mossy cell anatomy and synaptic input but do not strongly support the hypothesis that mossy cells develop into seizure-generating hub cells.",

abstract = "Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) or autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is an inherited epileptic syndrome with onset in childhood/adolescence and benign evolution. The hallmark of the syndrome consists of typical auditory auras or ictal aphasia in most affected family members. ADTLE/ADPEAF is associated in about half of the families with mutations of the leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene. In addition, de novo LGI1 mutations are found in about 2\% of sporadic cases with idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features, who are clinically similar to the majority of patients with ADLTE/ADPEAF but have no family history. Twenty-five LGI1 mutations have been described in familial and sporadic lateral temporal epilepsy patients. The mutations are distributed throughout the gene and are mostly missense mutations occurring in both the N-terminal leucine rich repeat (LRR) and C-terminal EPTP (beta propeller) protein domains. We show a tridimensional model of the LRR protein region that allows missense mutations of this region to be divided into two distinct groups: structural and functional mutations. Frameshift, nonsense and splice site point mutations have also been reported that result in protein truncation or internal deletion. The various types of mutations are associated with a rather homogeneous phenotype, and no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation can be identified. Both truncating and missense mutations appear to prevent secretion of mutant proteins, suggesting a loss of function effect of mutations. The function of LGI1 is unclear. Several molecular mechanisms possibly leading to lateral temporal epilepsy are illustrated and briefly discussed.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To investigate changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures in limbic system white matter of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using diffusion tensor tractography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), $\lambda$1, $\lambda$2, $\lambda$3, and trace (Tr) coefficients were obtained from tractography for bilateral fornix, superior and inferior cingulum fibers in 18 patients and 10 healthy controls. Hippocampal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) quantitative analysis was performed in order to confirm the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hippocampal lesion presence or absence in TLE patients. RESULTS: Nine patients presented unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (TLE+HS) and nine patients had no signal abnormalities on conventional MRI (TLE-HS). On the ipsilateral seizure side, all three investigated tracts showed significant DTI indices abnormalities in both patient groups when compared with controls, most marked on the inferior cingulum. Contralateral to the seizure side, the three tracts presented significant DTI parameters in only the TLE+HS group when compared with controls. CONCLUSION: The DTI abnormalities found in the TLE-HS group may suggest that in the inferior cingulum the structural integrity is more affected than in the fornix or superior cingulum white matter bundles. The eigenvalues taken separately add complementary information to the FA and Tr metrics and may be useful indices in better understanding the architectural reorganization of limbic system tracts in TLE patients without HS.",

abstract = "Many patients with epilepsy do not obtain proper control of their seizures through conventional treatment. We review aspects of the pathophysiology underlying epileptic phenomena, with a special interest in the role of the amygdala, stressing the importance of hypersynchronism in both ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. We then review experimental studies on electrical stimulation of mesiotemporal epileptogenic areas, the amygdala included, as a means to treat medically refractory epilepsy. Regular high-frequency stimulation (HFS) commonly has anticonvulsant effects and sparse antiepileptogenic properties. On the other hand, HFS is related to acute and long-term increases in excitability related to direct neuronal activation, long-term potentiation, and kindling, raising concerns regarding its safety and jeopardizing in-depth understanding of its mechanisms. In turn, the safer regular low-frequency stimulation (LFS) has a robust antiepileptogenic effect, but its pro- or anticonvulsant effect seems to vary at random among studies. As an alternative, studies by our group on the development and investigation of temporally unstructured electrical stimulation applied to the amygdala have shown that nonperiodic stimulation (NPS), which is a nonstandard form of LFS, is capable of suppressing both acute and chronic spontaneous seizures. We hypothesize two noncompetitive mechanisms for the therapeutic role of amygdala in NPS, 1) a direct desynchronization of epileptic circuitry in the forebrain and brainstem and 2) an indirect desynchronization/inhibition through nucleus accumbens activation. We conclude by reintroducing the idea that hypersynchronism, rather than hyperexcitability, may be the key for epileptic phenomena and epilepsy treatment.",

abstract = "Previous research has shown that in vivo on-demand optogenetic stimulation of inhibitory interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) is sufficient to suppress seizures in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Surprisingly, this intervention was capable of suppressing seizures when PV-expressing interneurons were stimulated ipsilateral or contralateral to the presumed seizure focus, raising the possibility of commissural inhibition in TLE. There are mixed reports regarding commissural PV interneuron projections in the healthy hippocampus, and it was previously unknown whether these connections would be maintained or modified following the network reorganization associated with TLE. Using retrograde labeling and viral vector technology in both sexes and the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of TLE, we therefore examined these issues. Our results reveal that healthy controls possess a population of commissurally projecting hippocampal PV interneurons. Two weeks post kainate injection, we observed a slight, but not statistically significant decrease in retrogradely labeled PV interneurons in the hippocampus contralateral to kainate and tracer injection. By 6 months post kainate, however, there was a significant increase in retrogradely labeled PV interneurons, suggesting commissural inhibitory axonal sprouting. Using viral green fluorescent protein expression selectively in PV neurons, we demonstrated sprouting of commissural PV projections in the dentate gyrus of the kainate-injected hippocampus 6 months post kainate. These findings indicate that PV interneurons supply direct inhibition to the contralateral hippocampus and undergo sprouting in a mouse model of TLE. \copyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is a debilitating disorder of uncontrollable recurrent seizures that occurs as a result of imbalances in the brain excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signals, that could stem from a range of functional and structural neuronal impairments. Globally, nearly 70 million people are negatively impacted by epilepsy and its comorbidities. One such comorbidity is the effect epilepsy has on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which plays a role in the control of blood circulation, respiration and gastrointestinal function. These epilepsy-induced impairments in the circulatory and respiratory systems may contribute toward sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although, various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of epilepsy on ANS, the linking pathological mechanism still remains unclear. Channelopathies and seizure-induced damages in ANS-control brain structures were some of the causal/pathological candidates of cardiorespiratory comorbidities in epilepsy patients, especially in those who were drug resistant. However, emerging preclinical research suggest that neurotransmitter/receptor dysfunction and synaptic changes in the ANS may also contribute to the epilepsy-related autonomic disorders. Thus, pathological mechanisms of cardiorespiratory dysfunction should be elucidated by considering the modifications in anatomy and physiology of the autonomic system caused by seizures. In this regard, we present a comprehensive review of the current literature, both clinical and preclinical animal studies, on the cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy and elucidate the possible pathological mechanisms of these findings, in hopes to prevent SUDEP especially in patients who are drug resistant.",

Using Western blotting and immunofluorescence, we investigated dysbindin expression in brain tissues of the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and rats with TLE (lithium chloride pilocarpine model) to explore its possible role in epileptogenesis. Twenty-five samples of temporal neocortex from patients undergoing surgery for drug-refractory TLE epilepsy and 10 histologically normal temporal lobes tissues from control subjects were used in our study. We also examined dysbindin expression in the hippocampus and adjacent cortex from experimental Sprague-Dawley rats. Dysbindin was expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons from epileptic specimens, and levels of dysbindin proteins were significantly increased in patients with TLE. Dysbindin was also expressed in the neurons of the hippocampus and adjacent cortex from experimental and control rats. Western blotting of rat brain tissue showed that dysbindin was upregulated gradually from 6 h after kindling. Maximal expression was seen around 2 months in chronic epileptic phase. These results demonstrated that the increased expression of dysbindin might play a role in the pathogenesis of drug-refractory TLE.",

Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level. In this respect, little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy-induced neuronal cell death. Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R -/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine. We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid (KA), a potent glutamate agonist. Importantly, D2R -/- mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity. However, pilocarpine-induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R -/- brains in comparison to KA. Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine. Moreover, the dopaminergic control of epilepsy-induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters.",

abstract = "We hypothesized that overexpression of specific glutamate receptors within the hippocampus would induce seizures and the associated cellular changes seen in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The GluR6 kainate receptor was overexpressed by injecting rat hippocampi with HSVGluR6, a viral vector transducing fully edited GluR6. These animals experienced limbic seizures approximately 4 h following the injection. Control animals injected with HSVlac, a vector expressing beta-galactosidase, did not have seizures. Recordings from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were performed 12 to 48 h and 1 week to 1 month postinjection. We observed nonsynaptic Na(+)-mediated bursting in 77.5\% of cells 12 to 48 h following injection of HSVGluR6 but not HSVlac. The synaptic responses were normal in both groups. However, the physiological properties of cells from HSVGluR6-injected hippocampi changed over time. Two weeks following HSVGluR6 injection, synaptic bursts could be evoked, but intrinsic bursting became rare. These changes persisted for at least 1 month. We postulate that this transition from intrinsic to synaptic hyperexcitability may be important in the development of TLE.",

abstract = "Epilepsy and stress are each significant concerns in today's society, bearing heavy impacts on mental and physical health and overall quality of life. Unfortunately, the intersection between these is potentially even more concerning, as stress is a frequent trigger of seizures and may contribute to neural hyperexcitability. A growing body of research suggests a connection between early life stress (occurring in the prenatal or postnatal stage) and later development of epilepsy. While the larger part of this literature suggests that early life stress increases vulnerability for epilepsy development, there are a number of interacting factors influencing this relationship. These factors include developmental stage at which both stressor and seizure assessment occur, type of stressor, sex effects, and type of seizure (convulsive or non-convulsive). Additionally, a number of potential mechanisms have been identified, including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, neuroinflammation, altered inhibitory/excitatory balance, and temporal lobe structures. Developing a clearer understanding of this relationship between early life stress and epilepsy, the factors that influence it, and underlying mechanisms that may serve as targets for intervention is crucial to improving quality of life for persons with epilepsy.",

It is not surprising then, that the pathways of seizure spread observed in different laboratories depend largely upon which areas of the brain into which monitoring electrodes have been implanted. As a result, previous studies of temporal lobe seizure spread have emphasized different candidate pathways which vary in the significance attributed to their role in interhemispheric seizure propagation. In addition, different techniques may be used for measuring seizure spread which may or may not correspond with one another, and may also provide differing perspectives.",

People with epilepsy consistently report stress as one of the most common triggers, although disentangling from confounders such as sleep deprivation, mood, and alcohol, and cause from effect has proved challenging. A great deal of effort (and money) has gone into pre-clinical and clinical research, including more recently functional imaging studies, such that we now have a good understanding of pathways and potential mechanisms. Similarly, there has been considerable work looking at ways to reduce stress, which can undoubtedly be of benefit in terms of psychological well-being, though may not improve seizure control. There has been very little consideration of cost-effectiveness or cost-utility thus far, which is of particular importance when there are inevitable limitations on resources. Thus beyond heightened awareness about the potential for stress and epilepsy to interact, little of this work has as yet translated into meaningful changes for clinical practice. Hopefully, further carefully directed preclinical and especially clinical research will lead to greater understanding of the interaction and benefit to patients.",

abstract = "The term ``Epilepsy'' encompasses a broad spectrum of medical and social disorders that affect about 65 million people worldwide and is commonly defined as a tendency to suffer recurrent seizures. In patients with epilepsy, ictal discharges that occur in (or propagate to) the anterior cingulate, insular, posterior orbito-frontal, and the pre-frontal cortices, along with the amygdala and hypothalamus play a key role in influencing the autonomic nervous system (ANS) at the cortical level. In turn, this can result in cardiac effects which are widespread and range from subtle changes in heart rate variability (HRV) to ictal sinus arrest, and from QT-interval shortening to atrial fibrillation. In addition, cardiac events are the main hypothesized mechanisms underlying sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which occurs in absence of a known structural cause. Patients with epilepsy also experience long-lasting changes in the regulation of the ANS and target organs. Heart rate (HR) and HRV can be easily measured/estimated when compared to other biomarkers that are commonly associated with seizures (i.e., long-term EEG), and are therefore potentially valuable biomarkers when it comes to characterizing seizures. In this context, a number of linear and nonlinear analysis techniques have been applied in order to detect and characterize epilepsy-related ANS changes. While the physiological and clinical applicability of nonlinear analyses like fractal and complexity measures of HR dynamics are not yet completely understood, in view of recent experimental findings it is reasonable to assume that such indices highlight abnormal patterns of RR interval behaviour that are not easily detected by commonly used moment statistics of HR variation. These findings may provide new insight regarding physiological and seizure-induced states of the complex brain-heart network underlying epilepsy and related autonomic modifications. A better understanding of the autonomic manifestations of seizures would provide practical added value to clinical epileptologists dealing with differential diagnosis of epilepsy and related disorders, as well as aiding in designing more sensitive seizure detection and prediction algorithms.",

Nevertheless, there remains a common assumption that epilepsy can be explained by simply an insufficiency of GABAergic inhibition. Alternatively, investigators have suggested that there is hyperinhibition that masks an underlying hyperexcitability. Here we examine the status epilepticus (SE) models of TLE and focus on the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where a great deal of data have been collected. The types of GABAergic neurons and GABAA receptors are summarized under normal conditions and after SE. The role of GABA in development and in adult neurogenesis is discussed. We suggest that instead of ``too little or too much'' GABA there is a complexity of changes after SE that makes the emergence of chronic seizures (epileptogenesis) difficult to understand mechanistically, and difficult to treat. We also suggest that this complexity arises, at least in part, because of the remarkable plasticity of GABAergic neurons and GABAA receptors in response to insult or injury.",

abstract = "Many patients with temporal lobe epilepsy display structural changes in the seizure initiating zone, which includes the hippocampus. Structural changes in the hippocampus include granule cell axon (mossy fiber) sprouting. The role of mossy fiber sprouting in epileptogenesis is controversial. A popular view of temporal lobe epileptogenesis contends that precipitating brain insults trigger transient cascades of molecular and cellular events that permanently enhance excitability of neuronal networks through mechanisms including mossy fiber sprouting. However, recent evidence suggests there is no critical period for mossy fiber sprouting after an epileptogenic brain injury. Instead, findings from stereological electron microscopy and rapamycin-delayed mossy fiber sprouting in rodent models of temporal lobe epilepsy suggest a persistent, homeostatic mechanism exists to maintain a set level of excitatory synaptic input to granule cells. If so, a target level of mossy fiber sprouting might be determined shortly after a brain injury and then remain constant. Despite the static appearance of synaptic reorganization after its development, work by other investigators suggests there might be continual turnover of sprouted mossy fibers in epileptic patients and animal models. If so, there may be opportunities to reverse established mossy fiber sprouting. However, reversal of mossy fiber sprouting is unlikely to be antiepileptogenic, because blocking its development does not reduce seizure frequency in pilocarpine-treated mice. The challenge remains to identify which, if any, of the many other structural changes in the hippocampus are epileptogenic.",

These drugs target the inhibitory and excitatory processes of the synaptic circuitry. However, it is known that the full performance of synaptic processes depends on ionic homeostasis, controlled by mechanisms such as: enzymes, sodium/potassium pump, cotransporters, ion exchangers and extra-synaptic channels. In this sense, the present work investigated the expression of mechanisms responsible for ionic homeostasis, such as the cotransporter NKCC1, KCC2 and the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, in the amygdaloid nuclei of rats submitted to the status epilepticus (SE) by pilocarpine injection. The results showed clear lesions in various amygdaloid nuclei and variations in KCC2 and Na+/K+ ATPase expression. The observed changes suggest an imbalance in the control of inhibitory and excitatory processes, which modulate the synchronous activities of the amygdala, such as cardiorespiratory functions, evidencing a possible biomarker of the increase in the risk of sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and revealing possible targets for its prevention.",

abstract = "RATIONALE: High doses of cocaine can elicit seizures in humans and in laboratory animals. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the induction of seizures by cocaine, including enhanced monoaminergic signaling, blockade of ion channels, and alterations in GABA and glutamate transmission. Mutations in the SCN1A gene, which encodes the central nervous system (CNS) voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) Nav1.1, are responsible for several human epilepsy disorders including Dravet syndrome and genetic (generalized) epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Mice heterozygous for the R1648H GEFS+ mutation (RH mice) exhibit reduced interneuron excitability, spontaneous seizures, and lower thresholds to flurothyl- and hyperthermia-induced seizures. However, it is unknown whether impaired CNS VGSC function or a genetic predisposition to epilepsy increases susceptibility to cocaine-induced seizures. OBJECTIVES: Our primary goal was to determine whether Scn1a dysfunction caused by the RH mutation alters sensitivity to cocaine-induced behavioral and electrographic (EEG) seizures. We also tested novelty- and cocaine-induced locomotor activity and assessed the expression of Nav1.1 in midbrain dopaminergic neurons. RESULTS: We found that RH mice had a profound increase in cocaine-induced behavioral seizure susceptibility compared to wild-type (WT) controls, which was confirmed with cortical EEG recordings. By contrast, although the RH mice were hyperactive in novel environments, cocaine-induced locomotor activity was comparable between the mutants and WT littermates. Finally, immunofluorescence experiments revealed a lack of Nav1.1 immunoreactivity in dopaminergic neurons. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that a disease-causing CNS VGSC mutation confers susceptibility to the proconvulsant, but not motoric, effects of cocaine.",

Variable expressivity among family members is a common feature of these inherited epilepsies, suggesting that genetic modifiers may influence the clinical manifestation of epilepsy. The transgenic mouse model Scn2a Q54 has an epilepsy phenotype as a result of a mutation in Scn2a that slows channel inactivation. The mice display progressive epilepsy that begins with short-duration partial seizures that appear to originate in the hippocampus. The partial seizures become more frequent and of longer duration with age and often induce secondary generalized seizures. Clinical severity of the Scn2a Q54 phenotype is influenced by genetic background. Congenic C57BL/6J.Q54 mice exhibit decreased incidence of spontaneous seizures, delayed seizure onset, and longer survival in comparison with [C57BL/6J $\times$ SJL/J]F1.Q54 mice. This observation indicates that strain SJL/J carries dominant modifier alleles at one or more loci that determine the severity of the epilepsy phenotype. Genome-wide interval mapping in an N2 backcross revealed two modifier loci on Chromosomes 11 and 19 that influence the clinical severity of of this sodium channel-induced epilepsy. Modifier genes affecting clinical severity in the Scn2a Q54 mouse model may contribute to the variable expressivity seen in epilepsy patients with sodium channel mutations.",

The molecular pathogenesis of FCD(IIb), which lack familial inheritance, is only poorly understood. Due to their highly differentiated, malformative nature and glioneuronal phenotype, FCD(IIb) share neuropathological characteristics with lesions observed in familial disorders such as cortical tubers present in patients with autosomal dominant tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), related to mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, and dysplastic gangliocytomas of the cerebellum found in Cowden disease. Current data have indicated distinct allelic variants of TSC1 to accumulate in FCD(IIb). TSC1 represents a tumor suppressor operating in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/insulin pathway. The tumor-suppressor gene PTEN is mutated in Cowden disease. Like PTEN, also carboxyl-terminal modulator protein (CTMP) modulates PI3K-pathway signaling, both via inhibition of Akt/PKB, a kinase inactivating the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Here, we have analyzed alterations of Akt, PTEN and CTMP relevant for insulin signaling upstream of TSC1/TSC2 in FCD(IIb). Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against phosphorylated Akt (phospho-Akt; Ser 473) in FCD(IIb) (n=23) showed strong phospho-Akt expression in dysplastic FCD(IIb) components. We have further studied sequence alterations of PTEN (n=34 FCD(IIb)) and CTMP (n=20 FCD(IIb)) by laser microdissection/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. We observed a somatic mutation in an FCD(IIb), i.e., amino-acid exchange at nucleotide position 834 (PTEN cDNA, GenBank AH007803.1) in exon 8 with replacement of phenylalanine by leucine (F278L). We also found several silent polymorphisms of PTEN in exon 2 and exon 8 as well as silent and coding polymorphisms but no mutations in CTMP. No loss of heterozygosity in FCD(IIb) (n=6) at 10q23 was observed. To our knowledge, we here report on the first somatic mutation of a tumor-suppressor gene, i.e., PTEN, in FCD(IIb). However, our study also demonstrates that mutational alterations of PTEN and CTMP do not play major pathogenetic roles for activation of Akt in FCD(IIb). Future studies need to determine the origin of insulin pathway activation upstream of TSC1/TSC2 in FCD(IIb).",

Pathway analysis of altered proteins identified top signaling pathways associated with activated oxidative phosphorylation (p = 6.3 $\times$ 10-15, z = 4.08) and inhibited EIF2 signaling (p = 2.0 $\times$ 10-21, z = - 2.56) in frontal cortex, and activated acute phase response in DG (p = 8.5 $\times$ 10-6, z = 2.65) and CA1-3 (p = 4.7 $\times$ 10-6, z = 2.00). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of clinical history indicated that SUDC-positive post-mortem virology (n = 4/17) had the most significant module in each brain region, with the top most significant associated with decreased mRNA metabolic processes (p = 2.8 $\times$ 10-5) in frontal cortex. Additional modules were associated with clinical history, including fever within 24 h of death (top: increased mitochondrial fission in DG, p = 1.8 $\times$ 10-3) and febrile seizure history (top: decreased small molecule metabolic processes in frontal cortex, p = 8.8 $\times$ 10-5) in all brain regions, neuropathological hippocampal findings in the DG (top: decreased focal adhesion, p = 1.9 $\times$ 10-3). Overall, cortical and hippocampal protein changes were present in SUDC cases and some correlated with clinical features. Our studies support that proteomic studies of SUDC cohorts can advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of these tragedies and may inform the development of preventive strategies.",

abstract = "Changes of cardiovascular function are frequent in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The baroreflex - the most important reflex for cardiovascular stability - has not been studied systematically in TLE. We evaluated cardiovascular variability and baroreflex function in TLE. In 22 TLE patients and 20 controls, we continuously monitored heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Time-domain parameters were derived from recordings at rest and from standard cardiovascular reflex tests. Spectral analysis determined sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of HR and BP in the low (LF-power) and high frequency range (HF-power). We calculated the relative LF- and HF-powers of HR in relation to the sum of LF- and HF-powers. LF/HF-ratio of HR was assessed as a parameter of sympatheticovagal balance. LF-transfer function gain between BP and HR determined baroreflex function.Time-domain parameters did not differ between TLE patients and controls. Spectral analysis showed decreased absolute LF- and HF-powers but increased relative LF-power and LF/HF-ratio of HR in TLE. LF-transfer function gain between BP and HR was reduced in TLE (p<0.05). The reduction of absolute LF- and HF-powers indicates decreased total autonomic variability in TLE. However, increased relative LF-power and LF/HF-ratio of HR in TLE show a relative increase of sympathetic tone. Most importantly, we demonstrate an impaired baroreflex function in TLE. These cardiovascular autonomic abnormalities may contribute to cardiac arrhythmia in TLE.",

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from MTLE patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (n = 28; 16 left-sided) and healthy controls (HC, n = 18) watching an animated fearful face paradigm. To explore functional connectivity, we used independent component analysis (ICA) of fMRI data to characterize possible amygdala network alterations that may be caused by lateralized amygdala dysfunction. We furthermore investigated the relationship between activation within the amygdala network and ToM task performance. The pattern of amygdalar BOLD activation observed in response to an animated fearful face paradigm was bilateral amygdalar activation in HC and amygdala activation lateralized to the contralateral side in MTLE patients. In HC, a hemispheric asymmetry of the amygdala network was present with amygdala co-activation in predominantly left temporolateral and frontal brain structures. In MTLE patients, the observed asymmetry of amygdala connectivity was modulated by the side of pathology and the extent of amygdalar connectivity to the parahippocampal gyrus and insula was related to ToM test performance. These findings suggest that ipsilateral amygdalar dysfunction in MTLE is associated with alterations in remote temporal and frontal brain areas. The study of psychiatric and neurological disorders via network analysis allows for a shift of focus away from viewing dysfunctions of individual structures to a pathological network that possibly gives rise to a variety of symptoms.",

At 12-month follow-up, the delay until the first recurrence was longer in the ECPC group (p = 0.008).

abstract = "BACKGROUND: People with epilepsy (PWE) and people with intellectual disabilities (ID) both live shorter lives than the general population and both conditions increase the risk of death further. We aimed to measure associations between certain risk factors for death in PWE and ID. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted in ten regions in England and Wales. Data were collected on PWE registered with secondary care ID and neurology services between 2017 and 2021. Prevalence rates of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and medical diagnoses, seizure frequency, psychotropic and antiseizure medications (ASM) prescribed, and health activity (epilepsy reviews/risk assessments/care plans/compliance etc.) recorded were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: 190 PWE and ID who died were compared with 910 living controls. People who died were less likely to have had an epilepsy risk assessment but had a greater prevalence of genetic conditions, older age, poor physical health, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, polypharmacy (not ASMs) and antipsychotic use. The multivariable logistic regression for risk of epilepsy-related death identified that age over 50, medical condition prevalence, antipsychotic medication use and the lack of an epilepsy review in the last 12 months as associated with increased risk of death. Reviews by psychiatrists in ID services was associated with a 72\% reduction in the odds of death compared neurology services. CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy and use of antipsychotics may be associated with death but not ASMs. Greater and closer monitoring by creating capable health communities may reduce the risk of death. ID services maybe more likely to provide this holistic approach.",

author = "Jane{\v c}ek, Michael and Dabrowska, Joanna",
abstract = "Despite its relatively well-understood role as a reproductive and pro-social peptide, oxytocin (OT) tells a more convoluted story in terms of its modulation of fear and anxiety. This nuanced story has been obscured by a great deal of research into the therapeutic applications of exogenous OT, driving more than 400 ongoing clinical trials. Drawing from animal models and human studies, we review the complex evidence concerning OT's role in fear learning and anxiety, clarifying the existing confusion about modulation of fear versus anxiety. We discuss animal models and human studies demonstrating the prevailing role of OT in strengthening fear memory to a discrete signal or cue, which allows accurate and rapid threat detection that facilitates survival. We also review ostensibly contrasting behavioral studies that nonetheless provide compelling evidence of OT attenuating sustained contextual fear and anxiety-like behavior, arguing that these OT effects on the modulation of fear vs. anxiety are not mutually exclusive. To disambiguate how endogenous OT modulates fear and anxiety, an understudied area compared to exogenous OT, we survey behavioral studies utilizing OT receptor (OTR) antagonists. Based on emerging evidence about the role of OTR in rat dorsolateral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and elsewhere, we postulate that OT plays a critical role in facilitating accurate discrimination between stimuli representing threat and safety. Supported by human studies, we demonstrate that OT uniquely facilitates adaptive fear but reduces maladaptive anxiety. Last, we explore the limited literature on endogenous OT and its interaction with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) with a special emphasis on the dorsolateral BNST, which may hold the key to the neurobiology of phasic fear and sustained anxiety.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is being investigated as a treatment for therapy-refractory obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Many different brain targets are being trialled. Several of these targets such as the ventral striatum (including the nucleus accumbens (NAc)), the ventral capsule, the inferior thalamic peduncle, and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST)) belong to the same network, are anatomically very close to one another, or even overlap. Data is still missing on how various stimulation parameters in a given target will affect surrounding anatomical areas and impact the clinical outcome of DBS. METHODS: In a pilot study of eleven participants with DBS of the BNST, we investigate through patient-specific simulation of electric field, which anatomical areas are affected by the electric field, and if this can be related to the clinical results. Our study combined individual patient's stimulation parameters at 12- and 24-month follow-up with image data from the preoperative MRI and postoperative CT. These data were used to calculate the distribution of electric field and create individual anatomical models of the field of stimulation. RESULTS: The individual electric stimulation fields by stimulation in the BNST were similar at both the 12- and 24-month follow-up, involving mainly anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), genu of the internal capsule (IC), BNST, fornix, anteromedial globus pallidus externa (GPe), and the anterior commissure. A statistical significant correlation (p < 0.05) between clinical effect measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and stimulation was found at the 12-month follow-up in the ventral ALIC and anteromedial GPe. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the targets under investigation for OCD are in anatomical proximity. As seen in our study, off-target effects are overlapping. Therefore, DBS in the region of ALIC, NAc, and BNST may perhaps be considered to be stimulation of the same target.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is a network disorder and each type of seizure involves distinct cortical and subcortical network, differently implicated in the control and propagation of the ictal activity. The role of the basal ganglia has been revealed in several cases of focal and generalized seizures. Here, we review the data that show the implication of the basal ganglia in absence, temporal lobe, and neocortical seizures in animal models (rodent, cat, and non-human primate) and in human. Based on these results and the advancement of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, basal ganglia neuromodulation has been tested with some success that can be equally seen as promising or disappointing. The effect of deep brain stimulation can be considered promising with a 76\% in seizure reduction in temporal lobe epilepsy patients, but also disappointing, since only few patients have become seizure free and the antiepileptic effects have been highly variable among patients. This variability could probably be explained by the heterogeneity among the patients included in these clinical studies. To illustrate the importance of specific network identification, electrophysiological activity of the putamen and caudate nucleus has been recorded during penicillin-induced pre-frontal and motor seizures in one monkey. While an increase of the firing rate was found in putamen and caudate nucleus during pre-frontal seizures, only the activity of the putamen cells was increased during motor seizures. These preliminary results demonstrate the implication of the basal ganglia in two types of neocortical seizures and the necessity of studying the network to identify the important nodes implicated in the propagation and control of each type of seizure.",

author = "Aroniadou-Anderjaska, V and Qashu, F and Braga, M F M",
abstract = "The amygdala, a temporal lobe structure that is part of the limbic system, has long been recognized for its central role in emotions and emotional behavior. Pathophysiological alterations in neuronal excitability in the amygdala are characteristic features of certain psychiatric illnesses, such as anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. Furthermore, neuronal excitability in the amygdala, and, in particular, excitability of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and symptomatology of temporal lobe epilepsy. Here, we describe two recently discovered mechanisms regulating neuronal excitability in the BLA, by modulating GABAergic inhibitory transmission. One of these mechanisms involves the regulation of GABA release via kainate receptors containing the GluR5 subunit (GluR5KRs). In the rat BLA, GluR5KRs are present on both somatodendritic regions and presynaptic terminals of GABAergic interneurons, and regulate GABA release in an agonist concentration-dependent, bidirectional manner. The relevance of the GluR5KR function to epilepsy is suggested by the findings that GluR5KR agonists can induce epileptic activity, whereas GluR5KR antagonists can prevent it. Further support for an important role of GluR5KRs in epilepsy comes from the findings that antagonism of GluR5KRs is a primary mechanism underlying the antiepileptic properties of the anticonvulsant topiramate. Another mechanism regulating neuronal excitability in the BLA by modulating GABAergic synaptic transmission is the facilitation of GABA release via presynaptic alpha1A adrenergic receptors. This mechanism may significantly underlie the antiepileptic properties of norepinephrine. Notably, the alpha1A adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of GABA release is severely impaired by stress. This stress-induced impairment in the noradrenergic facilitation of GABA release in the BLA may underlie the hyperexcitability of the amygdala in certain stress-related affective disorders, and may explain the stress-induced exacerbation of seizure activity in epileptic patients.",

Five patients (41.7\%) had recurrent events prior to initial review by an epileptologist, but when anti-syncope measures were instituted there were no seizure recurrences over a median follow-up period of 34.5 (interquartile range 29.3-41.8) months. CONCLUSIONS: Syncope may be an under-recognized trigger for convulsive acute symptomatic seizures. Avoidance of syncope may be more effective than anti-seizure medications in preventing reflex anoxic seizures.",

It also carries sensory afferent fibres from these viscera and reaches different brain structures. These connections have proven useful in the treatment of different diseases. Afferent stimulation of the left vagus nerve is used to treat epilepsy and major depression, and stimulation of the right vagus nerve is being tried for the treatment of heart failure. The device used for the therapy delivers intermittent stimuli. It is indicated worldwide for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in patients who are not appropriate candidates for respective surgery. It has also received approval for the treatment of major depression, obesity and episodic cluster headache by the Food and Drug Administration. Randomised controlled trials and prospective studies have confirmed the efficacy and safety of this therapy in epilepsy. Nevertheless, sporadic cases of ventricular asystole have been reported. To evaluate the effect of vagus nerve stimulation therapy on the autonomic nervous system, different studies that assess heart function and blood pressure changes have been conducted, although the methods employed were not homogeneous. These studies have found subtle or no significant changes in heart rate variability and blood pressure in epileptic patients. Moreover, this therapy may reduce the risk of one of the most lethal conditions in epilepsy-sudden unexpected death.",

title = "Autonomic aspects of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy ({SUDEP})",
author = "Barot, Niravkumar and Nei, Maromi",
abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major cause of epilepsy-related mortality. SUDEP is highly linked to seizures, with most deaths occurring after convulsive seizures in sleep. In most cases of SUDEP, convulsive seizures appear to directly trigger catastrophic cardiorespiratory dysfunction leading to death. In the last few decades, many pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the sequence of events leading to death. Patients with epilepsy often have underlying autonomic dysfunction, as measured by heart rate variability and other testing modalities. Additionally, seizures often trigger acute cardiac and respiratory dysfunction. While sinus tachycardia is the most common cardiac finding during seizures, asystole and malignant tachyarrhythmias may also occur. Seizures can also lead to respiratory dysfunction, including central ictal and obstructive apnea related to laryngospasm. Available data suggest that there could be underlying autonomic dysfunction, potentially related to genetic, medication, and other factors that might predispose individuals to sudden catastrophic cardio-respiratory dysfunction in the setting of a seizure, resulting in SUDEP. Further exploration of this possible link is needed. Patients with medically refractory epilepsy are at the highest risk, and adequate management via medical therapy to control convulsive seizures, or surgical intervention may decrease the SUDEP risk. Recently, many automated seizure detection systems have been developed to detect convulsive seizures, which may enable caregivers to more closely monitor individuals with epilepsy. Improved identification of seizures may be important for patients with refractory epilepsy as close supervision and timely intervention after a seizure could potentially reduce the risk of SUDEP.",

abstract = "Voltage-gated sodium channels initiate action potentials in brain neurons. In the 1970s, much was known about the function of sodium channels from measurements of ionic currents using the voltage clamp method, but there was no information about the sodium channel molecules themselves. As a postdoctoral fellow and staff scientist at the National Institutes of Health, I developed neurotoxins as molecular probes of sodium channels in cultured neuroblastoma cells. During those years, Bruce Ransom and I crossed paths as members of the laboratories of Marshall Nirenberg and Philip Nelson and shared insights about sodium channels in neuroblastoma cells from my work and electrical excitability and synaptic transmission in cultured spinal cord neurons from Bruce's pioneering electrophysiological studies. When I established my laboratory at the University of Washington in 1977, my colleagues and I used those neurotoxins to identify the protein subunits of sodium channels, purify them, and reconstitute their ion conductance activity in pure form. Subsequent studies identified the molecular basis for the main functions of sodium channels-voltage-dependent activation, rapid and selective ion conductance, and fast inactivation. Bruce Ransom and I re-connected in the 1990s, as ski buddies at the Winter Conference on Brain Research and as faculty colleagues at the University of Washington when Bruce became our founding Chair of Neurology and provided visionary leadership of that department. In the past decade my work on sodium channels has evolved into structural biology. Molecular modeling and X-ray crystallographic studies have given new views of sodium channel function at atomic resolution. Sodium channels are also the molecular targets for genetic diseases, including Dravet Syndrome, an intractable pediatric epilepsy disorder with major co-morbidities of cognitive deficit, autistic-like behaviors, and premature death that is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the brain sodium channel NaV1.1. Our work on a mouse genetic model of this disease has shown that its multi-faceted pathophysiology and co-morbidities derive from selective loss of electrical excitability and action potential firing in GABAergic inhibitory neurons, which disinhibits neural circuits throughout the brain and leads directly to the epilepsy, premature death and complex co-morbidities of this disease. It has been rewarding for me to use our developing knowledge of sodium channels to help understand the pathophysiology and to suggest potential therapeutic approaches for this devastating childhood disease.",

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of consecutive subjects who are more than 15 years old without known sleep disorders, recruited from a single epilepsy clinic in a tertiary care facility. Participants underwent polysomnography. Scoring was performed by two blinded board-certified sleep physicians. The relationships between rSUDEP-7 scores and OSA measures were evaluated using Wilcoxon rank-sum test, chi-squared test, and quantile regression. RESULTS: Our study population consisted of 95 participants. Overall median (IQR) apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of our populations was 2.3 (0.7,7.5) events rate per hour; 12 (75\%) patients had moderate OSA and 4 (25\%) patients had severe OSA. Nine patients had a rSUDEP-7 score of 5 to 7. There was no significant difference between total rSUDEP-7 score or rSUDEP-7 score of > 5 or 15. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals no association between AHI score, OSA, and total rSUDEP-7 score or rSUDEP-7 score of > 5. The pathophysiology underlying SUDEP appears complex. We need further studies on SUDEP to help elucidate the cardiorespiratory mechanisms and predisposing factors.",

Individuals with panic disorder may demonstrate significant differences in causal connectivity of the BNST in comparison to healthy controls. To test this hypothesis, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify aberrant causal connectivity of the BNST in PD patients. 19 PD patients and 18 healthy controls (HC) matched for gender, age and education were included. Granger causality analysis (GCA) utilizing the BNST as a seed region was used to investigate changes in directional connectivity. Relative to healthy controls, PD patients displayed abnormal directional connectivity of the BNST including enhanced causal connectivity between the left parahippocampal gyrus and left BNST, the right insula and the right BNST, the left BNST and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and right BNST to the left and right dlPFC. Furthermore, PD patients displayed weakened causal connectivity between the right dlPFC and the left BNST, the left dlPFC and the right BNST, the left BNST and the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), right insula, right fusiform, and right BNST to the right insula. The results suggest that PD strongly correlates with increased causal connectivity between emotional processing regions and the BNST and enhanced causal connectivity between the BNST and cognitive control regions.",

Invasive EEG study is usually necessary to delineate the epileptogenic zone, but constructing an accurate hypothesis to define an appropriate electrode implantation scheme and the treatment is challenging. This article reviews recent studies that help understanding the epileptogenicity and potential therapeutic options in PNH. RECENT FINDINGS: New noninvasive diagnostic and intracerebral EEG analytic tools demonstrated that cortical hyperexcitability and aberrant connectivity (between nodules and cortices and among nodules) are likely mechanisms causing epilepsy in most patients. The deeply seated PNH, if epileptogenic, are ideal target for stereotactic ablative techniques, which offer concomitant ablation of multiple regions with relatively satisfactory seizure outcome. Advance in diagnostic and analytic tools have enhanced our understanding of the complex epileptogenicity in PNH. Development in stereotactic ablative techniques now offers promising therapeutic options for these patients.",

abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review aims at providing an overview of relevant aspects of anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders (AD) in adults patients with epilepsy (PWE). RECENT FINDINGS: Firstly, the appropriate diagnosis of type of anxiety symptoms and AD in PWE will be presented. Anxiety symptoms are often peri-ictal and classified in relation to their temporal occurrence to seizures. Anxiety symptoms are of three types: preictal (preceding a seizure), ictal (presenting as part of the seizure symptoms and signs), and postictal (occurring within 72 h of a seizure). AD are diagnosed in the interictal period and occur independently of seizures. Four specific AD in PWE can be objectified: anticipatory anxiety of epileptic seizures (AAS), seizure phobia, epileptic social phobia, and epileptic panic disorder. Secondly, the bidirectional pathophysiological relationship between anxiety and epilepsy will be described. Anxiety is a trigger for seizures in some patients, and the notion of stress and arousal is essential to understand the relationship between anxiety and seizure. Moreover, seizures arising from the limbic network especially involving amygdala, which may express fear-related semiology, provide insight into the pathophysiology of AD comorbidities. Thirdly, the methods of screening for AD and anxiety symptoms will be detailed. Fourthly, the pharmacological and psychobehavioral management of anxiety symptoms and AD in PWE will be presented. Arousal-based approaches for preictal and ictal symptoms and anxiety-based approaches for postictal and interictal symptoms will be presented. Despite lack of evidence-based approaches, it is recognized that management of epilepsy is not only about controlling seizures, but also depends heavily on detecting, correctly diagnosing, and appropriately managing anxiety symptoms and AD comorbidities, in order to maximize quality of life. Improving self-control and self-efficacy is of fundamental importance in the management of PWE. Further rigorously designed studies focusing on anxiety symptoms and AD are essential to improve the overall care of PWE.",

abstract = "OPINION STATEMENT: Seizures represent a common symptom in low- and high-grade gliomas. Tumor location and histology influence the risk for epilepsy. Some molecular factors (BRAF V 600E mutations in glioneuronal tumors and IDH1/2 mutations in diffuse grade II and III gliomas) are molecular factors that are relevant for diagnosis and prognosis and have been associated with the risk of epilepsy as well. Glutamate plays a central role in epileptogenicity and growth of glial and glioneuronal tumors, based on the release of glutamate from tumor cells that enhances excitotoxicity, and a downregulation of the inhibitory GABAergic pathways. Several potential targets for therapy have been identified, and m-TOR inhibitors have already shown activity. Gross total resection is the strongest predictor of seizure freedom in addition to clinical factors, such as preoperative seizure duration, type, and control with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Radiotherapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents (procarbazine, CCNU, vincristine, temozolomide) are effective in reducing the frequency of seizures in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Newer AEDs (in particular levetiracetam and lacosamide) seem to be better tolerated than the old AEDs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine), but randomized clinical trials are needed to prove their superiority in terms of efficacy.",

A review of post-mortem reports from 2003 to 2018 was carried out to identify cases of SUDC, SUDEP and SIDS.

Statistical analysis was performed to compare the three groups. 48 SUDC, 18 SUDEP and 358 SIDS cases were identified. Hippocampal abnormalities associated with temporal lobe epilepsy were found in 44.4\% of SUDC cases. 5/15 SUDC cases with a history of seizures demonstrated hippocampal abnormalities. SUDC cases were also more likely to be found prone compared to SIDS cases.

abstract = "Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. These seizures are due to abnormal excessive and synchronous neuronal activity in the brain caused by a disruption of the delicate balance between excitation and inhibition. Neuropeptides can contribute to such misbalance by modulating the effect of classical excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. In this review, we discuss 21 different neuropeptides that have been linked to seizure disorders. These neuropeptides show an aberrant expression and/or release in animal seizure models and/or epilepsy patients. Many of these endogenous peptides, like adrenocorticotropic hormone, angiotensin, cholecystokinin, cortistatin, dynorphin, galanin, ghrelin, neuropeptide Y, neurotensin, somatostatin, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, are able to suppress seizures in the brain. Other neuropeptides, such as arginine-vasopressine peptide, corticotropin-releasing hormone, enkephalin, $\beta$-endorphin, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and tachykinins have proconvulsive properties. For oxytocin and melanin-concentrating hormone both pro- and anticonvulsive effects have been reported, and this seems to be dose or time dependent. All these neuropeptides and their receptors are interesting targets for the development of new antiepileptic drugs. Other neuropeptides such as nesfatin-1 and vasoactive intestinal peptide have been less studied in this field; however, as nesfatin-1 levels change over the course of epilepsy, this can be considered as an interesting marker to diagnose patients who have suffered a recent epileptic seizure.",

However, the central sites and circuit mechanisms underlying the respiratory effects of leptin remain incompletely understood. The present study aimed to address whether neurons expressing leptin receptor b (LepRb) in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) contribute to respiratory control. Both chemogenetic and optogenetic stimulation of LepRb-expressing NTS (NTSLepRb) neurons notably activated breathing. Moreover, stimulation of NTSLepRb neurons projecting to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) not only remarkably increased basal ventilation to a level similar to that of the stimulation of all NTSLepRb neurons, but also activated LPBN neurons projecting to the preB{\"o}tzinger complex (preB{\"o}tC). By contrast, ablation of NTSLepRb neurons projecting to the LPBN notably eliminated the enhanced respiratory effect induced by NTSLepRb neuron stimulation. In brainstem slices, bath application of leptin rapidly depolarized the membrane potential, increased the spontaneous firing rate, and accelerated the Ca2+ transients in most NTSLepRb neurons. Therefore, leptin potentiates breathing in the NTS most likely via an NTS-LPBN-preB{\"o}tC circuit.",

author = "Stewart, Mark",
abstract = "This review traces the examination of autonomic, cardiovascular, and respiratory derangements associated with seizure activity in the clinical and preclinical literature generally, and in the author's animal model specifically, and concludes with the author's views on the potential mechanisms for sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP). An animal model that employs kainic acid-induced seizures on a background of urethane anesthesia has permitted unprecedented access to the behavior of autonomic, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems during seizure activity. The result is a detailed description of the major causes of death and how this animal model can be used to develop and test preventative and interventional strategies. A critical translational step was taken when the rat data were shown to directly parallel data from definite SUDEP cases in the clinical literature. The reasons why ventricular fibrillation as a cause of death is so rarely reported and tools for verifying that seizure-associated laryngospasm can induce obstructive apnea as a cause of death are discussed in detail. Many details of the specific kinetics of activation of brainstem neurons serving autonomic and respiratory function remain to be elucidated, but the boundary conditions described in this review provide an excellent framework for more focused studies. A number of studies conducted in animal models of seizure activity and in epilepsy patients have contributed information on the autonomic, cardiovascular, and respiratory consequences of seizure activity spreading through hypothalamus and brainstem to the periphery. The result is detailed information on the systemic impact of seizure spread and the development of an understanding of the essential mechanistic features of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This review summarizes translation of data obtained from animal models to biomarkers that are useful in evaluating data from epilepsy patients.",

abstract = "Epilepsies affect about 4\% of the population and are frequently characterized by a prolonged ``silent'' period before the onset of spontaneous seizures. Most current animal models of epilepsy either involve acute seizure induction or kindling protocols that induce repetitive seizures. We have developed a rat model of epilepsy that is characterized by a slowly progressing series of behavioral abnormalities prior to the onset of behavioral seizures. In the current study, we further describe an accompanying progression of cytoarchitectural changes in the hippocampal formation. Groups of male and female SD rats received serial injections of a low dose of domoic acid (0.020 mg/kg) (or vehicle) throughout the second week of life. Postmortem hippocampal tissue was obtained on postnatal days 29, 64, and 90 and processed for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), NeuN, and calbindin expression. The data revealed no significant changes on postnatal day (PND) 29 but a significant increase in hilar NeuN-positive cells in some regions on PND 64 and 90 that were identified as ectopic granule cells. Further, an increase in GFAP positive cell counts and evidence of reactive astrogliosis was found on PND 90 but not at earlier time points. We conclude that changes in cellular expression, possibly due to on-going non-convulsive seizures, develop slowly in this model and may contribute to progressive brain dysfunction that culminates in a seizure-prone phenotype.",

abstract = "When mimicking epileptic processes in a laboratory setting, it is important to understand the differences between experimental models of seizures and epilepsy. Because human epilepsy is defined by the appearance of multiple spontaneous recurrent seizures, the induction of a single acute seizure without recurrence does not constitute an adequate epilepsy model. Animal models of epilepsy might be useful for various tasks. They allow for the investigation of pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, the evaluation, or the development of new antiepileptic treatments, and the study of the consequences of recurrent seizures and neurological and psychiatric comorbidities. Although clinical relevance is always an issue, the development of models of pediatric epilepsies is particularly challenging due to the existence of several key differences in the dynamics of human and rodent brain maturation. Another important consideration in modeling pediatric epilepsy is that ``children are not little adults,'' and therefore a mere application of models of adult epilepsies to the immature specimens is irrelevant. Herein, we review the models of pediatric epilepsy. First, we illustrate the differences between models of pediatric epilepsy and models of the adulthood consequences of a precipitating insult in early life. Next, we focus on new animal models of specific forms of epilepsies that occur in the developing brain. We conclude by emphasizing the deficiencies in the existing animal models and the need for several new models.",

Studies of epileptogenesis, however, as distinct from ictogenesis, have been pursued for only a few decades, and antiepileptogenesis, the prevention of epilepsy or its progression, and the reversal of the epileptogenic process or cure, are relatively recent interests of the basic research community. The goal to develop antiepileptogenic interventions would be greatly facilitated by the identification of reliable biomarkers of epileptogenesis that could be used to create cost-effective, high-throughput screening models for potential antiepileptogenic compounds, as well as enrich patient populations and serve as surrogate endpoints for clinical trials. Without such biomarkers, the cost for clinical validation of antiepileptogenic interventions would be prohibitive. Epileptogenic mechanisms, antiepileptogenic interventions, and biomarkers are likely to be specific for the many different causes of epilepsy, which include genetic influences, cell loss and synaptic plasticity, malformations of cortical development, and autoimmune disorders, to name but a few. A high priority is currently being placed on investigations to elucidate fundamental mechanisms of epileptogenesis and identify biomarkers for specific models of human epilepsy, such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and a variety of pediatric diseases, including tuberous sclerosis and West syndrome.",

While traditionally psychiatric disorders were considered as a complication of the underlying seizure disorder, new epidemiologic data, supported by clinical and experimental research, have suggested the existence of a bidirectional relation between the two types of conditions: not only are patients with epilepsy at greater risk of experiencing a psychiatric disorder, but patients with primary psychiatric disorders are at greater risk of developing epilepsy. Do these data suggest that some of the pathogenic mechanisms operant in psychiatric comorbidities play a role in epileptogenesis? The aim of this article is to review the epidemiologic data that demonstrate that primary psychiatric disorders are more frequent in people who develop epilepsy, before the onset of the seizure disorder than among controls. The next question looks at the available data of pathogenic mechanisms of primary mood disorders and their potential for facilitating the development and/or exacerbation in the severity of epileptic seizures. Finally, we review data derived from experimental studies in animal models of depression and epilepsy that support a potential role of pathogenic mechanisms of mood disorders in the development of epileptic seizures and epileptogenesis. The data presented in this article do not yet establish conclusive evidence of a pathogenic role of psychiatric comorbidities in epileptogenesis, but raise important research questions that need to be investigated in experimental, clinical, and population-based epidemiologic research studies.",

Epileptiform discharges and antiepileptic medications may in turn detrimentally impact sleep. Co-morbid sleep disorders also have the potential to worsen seizure control.

abstract = "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked epileptic seizures. The majority of people given a diagnosis of epilepsy have a good prognosis, but 20-30 \% will develop drug-resistant epilepsy. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulatory treatment that is used as an adjunctive therapy for treating people with medically refractory epilepsy. It consists of chronic intermittent electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, delivered by a programmable pulse generator (Neuro-Cybernetic Prosthesis). In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration approved VNS as adjunctive treatment for medically refractory partial-onset seizures in adults and adolescents. This article reviews the literature from 1988 to nowadays. We discuss thoroughly the anatomy and physiology of vagus nerve and the potential mechanisms of actions and clinical applications involved in VNS therapy, as well as the management, safety, tolerability and effectiveness of VNS therapy. VNS for partial seizures appears to be an effective and well tolerated treatment in adult and pediatric patients. People noted improvements in feelings of well-being, alertness, memory and thinking skills, as well as mood. The adverse effect profile is substantially different from the adverse effect profile associated with antiepileptic drugs, making VNS a potential alternative for patients with difficulty tolerating antiepileptic drug adverse effects. Despite the passing years and the advent of promising neuromodulation technologies, VNS remains an efficacy treatment for people with medically refractory epilepsy. Past and ongoing investigations in other indications have provided signals of the therapeutic potential in a wide variety of conditions.",

The study included 46 drug-resistant and 42 seizure-free epilepsy patients. The demographic and clinical features of the patients were investigated for their effects on patient QoL. The QoL was assessed by the QoL in Epilepsy Inventory-89 and depression was detected by the Beck Depression Inventory. The QoL was significantly lower in the drug-resistant patients than in the seizure-free epilepsy patients (p < 0.001). Depression, lower education level, and unemployment were associated with lower QoL scores (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively). After adjusting for lower education level and unemployment, depression remained as an independent factor affecting QoL (p < 0.05).

Devices that facilitate the detection of seizures can have a large influence on a patient's quality of life, therapeutic decisions and the conduct of clinical trials with anti-epileptic drugs. This article provides an up-to-date overview and comparison between wearable seizure detection devices (WSDDs), taking into account the newly proposed standards for testing and clinical validation of devices. 16 devices were included in our comparison. The F1-score, combining the device's accurate recall and precision, was calculated for each of these devices and used to evaluate their performance. The devices were separated by development phase and ranked by F1-score from highest to lowest. We describe 16 WSDDs: 6 of which were accelerometry (ACM)-based, 3 surface electromyography-based, 1 was a wearable application of EEG, 4 had multimodal sensors and 2 other types of sensors. We observed a significant inconsistency in the description of performance measures. The devices in the most advanced development phase with the highest F1-scores incorporated ACM- and sEMG-based sensors to detect tonic-clonic seizures. This review highlights the importance of implementing standards for an optimal comparison and, therefore, improving the research and development of WSDDs. WSDDs can improve the patient's care and quality of life, decrease seizure underreporting and they could potentially prevent sudden-unexpected-death in epilepsy. We discuss the central role of the neurologist in the use of WSDDs, and why a business to business to consumer model is better than the current business to consumer model of most WSDDs.",

Over time, patients develop other seizure types (myoclonic, atypical absences, drops), intellectual disability, crouch gait and other co-morbidities (sleep problems, autonomic dysfunction). Complete seizure control is generally not achievable with current therapies, and the goals of treatment are to balance reduction of seizure burden with adverse effects of therapies. Treatment of co-morbidities must also be addressed, as they have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with DS. Seizures are typically worsened with sodium-channel agents. Accepted first-line agents include clobazam and valproic acid, although these rarely provide adequate seizure control. Benefit has also been noted with topiramate, levetiracetam, the ketogenic diet and vagal nerve stimulation. Several agents presently in development, specifically fenfluramine and cannabidiol, have shown efficacy in clinical trials. Status epilepticus is a recurring problem for patients with DS, particularly in their early childhood years. All patients should be prescribed a home rescue therapy (usually a benzodiazepine) but should also have a written seizure action plan that outlines when rescue should be given and further steps to take in the local hospital if the seizure persists despite home rescue therapy.",

author = "L{\"o}scher, Wolfgang and Klein, Pavel",
abstract = "Epilepsy is one of the most common and disabling chronic neurological disorders. Antiseizure medications (ASMs), previously referred to as anticonvulsant or antiepileptic drugs, are the mainstay of symptomatic epilepsy treatment. Epilepsy is a multifaceted complex disease and so is its treatment. Currently, about 30 ASMs are available for epilepsy therapy. Furthermore, several ASMs are approved therapies in nonepileptic conditions, including neuropathic pain, migraine, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Because of this wide spectrum of therapeutic activity, ASMs are among the most often prescribed centrally active agents. Most ASMs act by modulation of voltage-gated ion channels; by enhancement of gamma aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition; through interactions with elements of the synaptic release machinery; by blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors; or by combinations of these mechanisms. Because of differences in their mechanisms of action, most ASMs do not suppress all types of seizures, so appropriate treatment choices are important. The goal of epilepsy therapy is the complete elimination of seizures; however, this is not achievable in about one-third of patients. Both in vivo and in vitro models of seizures and epilepsy are used to discover ASMs that are more effective in patients with continued drug-resistant seizures. Furthermore, therapies that are specific to epilepsy etiology are being developed. Currently, ~ 30 new compounds with diverse antiseizure mechanisms are in the preclinical or clinical drug development pipeline. Moreover, therapies with potential antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying effects are in preclinical and clinical development. Overall, the world of epilepsy therapy development is changing and evolving in many exciting and important ways. However, while new epilepsy therapies are developed, knowledge of the pharmacokinetics, antiseizure efficacy and spectrum, and adverse effect profiles of currently used ASMs is an essential component of treating epilepsy successfully and maintaining a high quality of life for every patient, particularly those receiving polypharmacy for drug-resistant seizures.",

Microelectrophoretic deposits of tritiated proline and leucine which involved the caudal part of the NTS, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (dmX), and portions of the hypoglossal nucleus, nucleus intercalatus and/or nucleus gracilis were found to label ascending fibers that, besides going to numerous brain stem territories that included prominently the parabrachial area, could also be traced to several forebrain structures, namely, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), the paraventricular (PA), dorsomedial (HDM) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei of the hypothalamus, the central nucleus of the amygdaloid complex (AC), the medial preoptic area (PM) and the periventricular nucleus of the thalamus (TPV). Smaller isotope injections almost completely confined to the NTS and dmX resulted in lighter labeling of a similar set of parabrachial and forebrain projections, whereas in another case, in which the deposit was almost exclusively limited to the nucleus gracilis, no label was seen in the aforementioned structures. In another series of experiments, aimed at further localizing the neurons of origin of the prosencephalic projections under consideration, small microelectrophoretic HRP injections confined almost totally to BST, PA, HDM, AC, PM or TPV, as well as both small and large injections involving ARC, resulted in labeled neurons situated in the dorsal medullary region, mainly in the medial portion of the NTS at the level of and caudal to the area postrema.

abstract = "Variation in cell loss and mossy fiber reorganization was examined along the longitudinal axis of the dentate gyrus from temporal lobe epileptic (TLE) patients. Previous evidence has indicated that the anterior hippocampus is prone to seizure activity. We compared granule and hilar cell number in addition to Timm stain density of the molecular layer and hilus in more anterior and more posterior specimens of hippocampus obtained from patients surgically treated for intractable epilepsy by the removal of the anterior half of the hippocampus. Granule cells/mm in the more anterior specimen were less than or equal to those in the more posterior specimen locations in 77\% of the patients, while there was no significant difference in hilar neuron density between the two blocks. These results demonstrate a significantly greater pathology in the granule cell layer in more anterior specimens and no difference in pathology for hilar neurons. Molecular layer Timm stain density was significantly greater in the more anterior specimen of 71\% of the patients. The molecular layer Timm stain density ratio was inversely related to hilar cell density in more anterior specimens, whereas in more posterior specimens there was no significant relationship with hilar cell density. Our observations show that although differences exist among TLE patients for these neuroanatomic measures, pathology was greater in more anterior specimens. The latter result is consistent with the conclusion that seizure activity may originate in the anterior region of the hippocampus in a majority of patients.",

author = "Naritoku, Dean K and Mecozzi, Laura B and Aiello, Mary T and Faingold, Carl L",
abstract = "Repetition of seizures appears to increase severity in a number of seizure models, but the nature of these severity increases has not been elucidated in naturally occurring genetic epilepsy models. The genetically epilepsy-prone rat (GEPR) is highly susceptible to many seizure provoking stimuli, and high intensity acoustic stimuli induce audiogenic seizures (AGS). The role of forebrain structures in AGS in the GEPR has not been clear, and the presence of cortical epileptiform EEG activity in the GEPR is controversial. The present study examined the effects of 21 daily AGS repetitions on behavior and EEG activity recorded from the cortex of two GEPR substrains that exhibit moderate (GEPR-3) or severe AGS (GEPR-9). The results indicated that AGS repetition induced seizure severity increases in both GEPR substrains and resulted in prominent cortical epileptiform EEG activity. The AGS behavioral patterns remained distinctly different in the two substrains throughout seizure repetition. In each substrain a different additional behavioral phase was expressed; the GEPR-9 exhibited post-tonic clonus, and the GEPR-3 exhibited facial and forelimb clonus. These findings indicate that seizure repetition results in expansion of the neuronal network subserving AGS to involve forebrain structures. The medial geniculate body and amygdala appear to be part of this expanded network, and long-term potentiation, which was reported in the pathway between the latter brain structures, may be involved. These data suggest that recruitment of forebrain structures into the AGS neuronal network appears to be essential for production of the additional ictal behaviors evoked by AGS repetition.",

Ictal (duration: 3-20 s; rate of occurrence: 3-12 x 10(-3) s-1) and interictal (duration: 0.2-0.8 s; rate of occurrence: 0.2-0.8 s-1) discharges were recorded in young slices, while only interictal activity (duration: 70-90 ms; rate of occurrence: 0.5-0.9 s-1) discharges were observed in adult slices. In addition, in both young and adult slices 4-AP disclosed a synchronous long-lasting potential (duration and rate of occurrence: 0.6-3 s, 7-70 x 10(-3) s-1 and 260-660 ms, 8-60 x 10(-3) s-1, respectively) that was caused by the activation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. In young slices, ictal discharges were blocked by CBZ (0.05 mM), PHT (0.1 mM), PhB (0.5 mM) and VPA (0.5 mM). With the exception of PhB, higher concentrations were necessary in these experiments for blocking the interictal activity (i.e., CBZ: 0.1 mM; PHT: > 0.2 mM; VPA: 2 mM). At these concentrations, none of the AEDs blocked the interictal activity in the adult hippocampus, but only reduced the rate of occurrence. PhB enhanced the rate of occurrence of the synchronous GABA-mediated long-lasting potentials both in young (increase: 190\%) and in adult (increase: 145\%) slices, while VPA increased their occurrence by 54\% only in young slices. CBZ decreased the rate of occurrence of this long-lasting potential only in adult hippocampus.

author = "Faingold, Carl L and Tupal, Srinivasan",
editor = "Faingold, Carl L and Blumenfeld, Hal",
abstract = "As discussed in this book, there are many primary neuronal networks that mediate important physiological functions of the central nervous system (CNS), including vision, hearing, locomotion, and respiration. Each of these normal networks can interact with other primary networks to mediate important cross-network functions, and the interaction can be either additive or competitive. An example of an additive or positive form of network interaction is seen in sensorimotor integration, including the visual-motor interactions that mediate eye movements in response to visual stimuli. Primary networks can also interact with nonprimary conditional multireceptive networks, leading to the emergence of more complex phenomena. These phenomena include certain forms of learning as well as CNS disorders, including, for example, those that can lead to death in epilepsy. Neuronal networks can compete with each other to reduce the network function. This occurs, for example, when an acoustic stimulus can induce cessation of locomotion in a learning paradigm such as fear conditioning. A negative interaction is also seen in the prototypical competitive network interaction that forms the basis of the original and conceptually important network interaction hypothesis, the gate control theory of pain. This network competition mechanism is proposed to be a critical mechanism mediating the therapeutic stimulation paradigms currently used to treat many CNS disorders. Network interactions are mediated by (1) direct electrophysiological connections between network neurons that release endogenous neuroactive substances via synaptic transmission and (2) indirect interactions that release these substances via volume transmission. These network interactions can occur essentially instantaneously or sequentially over a finite time course. The interactions can involve two networks, as in the somatosensory-motor network interactions, which occur in the tactile startle response, and are also seen in the interaction of the pain network with the therapeutic network initiated by certain pain-relieving electrical stimulation therapies. The network interactions can be more complex, involving three or more networks, and examples of multinetwork interaction include fear-potentiated startle, seizure-induced analgesia, and audiogenic seizure kindling. An example of such a multinetwork interaction with fatal consequences is proposed to occur in the CNS disorder of epilepsy called sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The DBA/1 and DBA/2 mouse models of SUDEP involve additive interactions between the auditory and locomotor networks and a subsequent negative interaction with the respiratory network, which results in respiratory arrest. These network interactions may be mediated, in part, by the release of endogenous neuroactive substances that inhibit (e.g. adenosine) or enhance (e.g. serotonin) the activity of the respiratory network via synaptic and/or volume transmission. Thus, investigations of network interactions in normal situations and in CNS disorders may provide the keys to understanding learning mechanisms and also for treating CNS disorders with stimulation and/or pharmacological paradigms.",

Epileptic seizures represent the situation of increased neuronal activity associated with the enhanced demands for sufficient energy supply. For that purpose, very efficient regulatory mechanisms have to operate to ensure that cerebral blood flow, delivery of oxygen, and nutrients are continuously adapted to the local metabolic needs. The sophisticated regulation has to function in concert at several levels (systemic, tissue, cellular, and subcellular). Particularly, mitochondria play a key role not only in the energy production, but they are also central to many other processes including those leading to neuronal death. Impairment of any of the involved pathways can result in serious functional alterations, neurodegeneration, and potentially in epileptogenesis.

From a variety of sensory inputs, the BNST acts as a node for signal integration and coordination for information relay to downstream central neuroendocrine and autonomic centers for appropriate homeostatic physiological and behavioral responses. In contrast to the role of the amygdala in fear, the BNST has gained wide interest from work suggesting that it has main roles in mediating sustained responses to diffuse, unpredictable and/or long-duration threats that are typically associated with anxiety-related responses. Further, some BNST subregions are highly sexually dimorphic which appear contributory to the differential stress and social interactive behaviors, including reproductive responses, between males and females. Notably, maladaptive BNST neuroplasticity and function have been implicated in chronic pain, depression, anxiety-related abnormalities, and other psychopathologies including posttraumatic stress disorders. The BNST circuits are predominantly GABAergic---the glutaminergic neurons represent a minor population---but the complexity of the system results from an overlay of diverse neuropeptide coexpression in these neurons. More than a dozen neuropeptides may be differentially coexpressed in BNST neurons, and from variable G protein-coupled receptor signaling, may inhibit or activate downstream circuit activities. The mechanisms and roles of these peptides in modulating intrinsic BNST neurocircuit signaling and BNST long-distance target cell projections are still not well understood. Nevertheless, an understanding of some of the principal players may allow assembly of the circuit interactions.",

The connections between the BNST and hypothalamus are conserved across species, promote activation of the HPA axis, and can increase avoidance of aversive environments, which is historically associated with anxiety behaviors. However, BNST--hypothalamus circuitry is also implicated in motivated behaviors, drug seeking, feeding, and sexual behavior. These complex and diverse roles, as well its sexual dimorphism, indicate that the BNST--hypothalamus circuitry is an essential component of the neural circuitry that may underlie various psychiatric diseases, ranging from anorexia to anxiety to addiction. The following review is a cross-species exploration of BNST--hypothalamus circuitry. First, we describe the BNST subnuclei, microcircuitry and complex reciprocal connections with the hypothalamus.

In this chapter, we review contributions of the BNST and amygdala to subjective, behavioral, and physiological aspects of fear. Despite the fact that both regions are together involved in each of these aspects of fear, they appear complimentary in their contributions. Specifically, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), through its connections to sensory and orbitofrontal regions, is ideally poised for fast learning and controlling fear reactions in a variety of situations. The central amygdala (CeA) relies on BLA input and is particularly important for adjusting physiological and behavioral responses under acute threat. In contrast, the BNST may profit from more extensive striatal and dorsomedial prefrontal connections to drive anticipatory responses under more ambiguous conditions that allow more time for planning. Thus current evidence suggests that the BNST is ideally suited to play a critical role responding to distant or ambiguous threats and could thereby facilitate goal-directed defensive action.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a limbic forebrain structure nestled below the lateral ventricles, surrounding the anterior commissure, and its neighboring regions, the striatum, thalamus, and hypothalamus. The BNST is an integral component of the extended amygdala, a network of brain areas that span the anterior/posterior gradient of the brain starting anterior in the nucleus accumbens, continuing through the transition areas, and into the BNST and the central nucleus of the amygdala. The BNST has functional outputs relevant for reward and stress, and it is interconnected with brain areas involved in generating and regulating mood and overall emotional state. Various brain circuits are regulated by BNST outputs, and complex intrinsic microcircuits regulate the overall activity state of the BNST and modulate outputs to other brain areas. The BNST integrates cortical and subcortical inputs to determine affective state and whether a stimulus/situation will produce fear, anxiety, depression, irritability, or reward motivation/goal-directed behavior. On the cellular level, this highly heterogeneous brain area contains a diverse population of cell types and inputs, thus allowing for nuanced regulation of emotional state and behavioral responses.",

Many people with epilepsy live normal lives, but are at risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This mysterious comorbidity of epilepsy causes premature death in 17\%--50\% of those with epilepsy. Most SUDEP occurs after a generalized seizure, and patients are typically found in bed in the prone position. Until recently, it was thought that SUDEP was due to cardiovascular failure, but patients who died while being monitored in hospital epilepsy units revealed that most SUDEP is due to postictal central apnea. Some cases may occur when seizures invade the amygdala and activate projections to the brainstem. Evidence suggests that the pathophysiology is linked to defects in the serotonin system and central CO2 chemoreception, and that there is considerable overlap with mechanisms thought to be involved in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Future work is needed to identify biomarkers for patients at highest risk, improve ascertainment, develop methods to alert caregivers when SUDEP is imminent, and find effective approaches to prevent these fatal events.",

Many 5-HT neurons are closely associated with large arteries of the brainstem, where they respond to changes in arterial CO2 levels by increasing their firing rate. These properties allow them to play an important role as central respiratory chemoreceptors, causing an increase in ventilation in response to increased CO2 levels so that CO2 and pH return back to normal. Some 5-HT neurons in the midbrain play a similar role in sensing changes in blood CO2, and induce arousal when CO2 levels increase during sleep. Defects in 5-HT neurons occur in a variety of human diseases and may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and panic disorder, each of which may involve abnormalities of respiratory control and blood gas homeostasis.",

CRF itself can produce limbic seizures which resemble kindling in some aspects. However, tolerance to the convulsant effects of CRF develops rapidly. Hypothetically, this could be explained should seizures also induce the CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP), which has been postulated to restrict the actions of CRF. Therefore, in the present study, we used in situ hybridization to examine the effects of amygdala-kindled seizures on the mRNA levels of CRF and CRF-BP. Kindled seizures markedly elevated CRF and CRF-BP in the dentate gyrus of rats. CRF and CRF-BP were induced almost exclusively in GABAergic interneurons of the dentate hilus. The CRF and CRF-BP interneurons also expressed neuropeptide Y but not cholecystokinin. CRF appeared to have an excitatory role in the dentate gyrus as it decreased the afterhyperpolarization of dentate granule neurons. These results suggest that CRF may contribute to the development of amygdala kindling. However, the compensatory induction of CRF-BP may serve to limit the excitatory effects of CRF in the dentate gyrus.",

In this study, the cardiovascular effects of microinjecting the tridecapeptide neurotensin (NT) or its analogues NT 1-8 and [D-Trp11]NT into NTS were investigated in the chloralose-anesthetized, paralyzed and artificially ventilated rat. Microinjection of NT (10 pmol) elicited decreases in arterial pressure (AP) (-34 +/- 3 mm Hg) and heart rate (HR) (-28 +/- 2 beats/min), whereas microinjection of equimolar amounts of the NT fragment NT 1-8 elicited a significantly smaller depressor response (-14 +/- 3 mm Hg), but the bradycardic (-22 +/- 4 beats/min) response was similar in magnitude to that elicited by NT. On the other hand, microinjection of [D-Trp11]NT did not elicit cardiovascular responses from sites in NTS. In addition, the prior injection of [D-Trp11]NT into cardiovascular responsive sites in the NTS did not significantly reduce the AP or HR response to NT. The depressor response elicited by NT was not affected by bilateral vagotomy but was abolished by either C1-C2 spinal cord transection or the i.v. administration of the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium bromide. The cardiac slowing was partially attenuated by either bilateral vagotomy (-19 +/- 2 beats/min), i.v. administration of atropine methyl bromide (-17 +/- 4 beats/min), i.v. administration of hexamethonium bromide (-11 +/- 4 beats/min) or by spinal cord transection (-12 +/- 3 beats/min), and completely abolished after total autonomic blockade or by combined bilateral vagotomy and spinal cord transection. These data have demonstrated that within a restricted region of the caudal NTS NT activates neurons that contribute to vasodepressor responses as a result of sympatho-inhibition and to bradycardia responses as a result of vagal excitation and sympatho-inhibition. Furthermore, these data suggest that NT may act as a neurotransmitter or modulator in central cardiovascular reflex pathways.",

abstract = "Aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, which presumably results from hilar mossy cell death after status epilepticus (SE), is a frequently studied feature of temporal lobe epilepsy. Although mossy fiber sprouting can be suppressed by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, spontaneous seizures remain unaltered. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying the ability of cycloheximide to block SE-induced mossy fiber sprouting in the inner molecular layer of dentate gyrus (IML). Pilocarpine-induced SE in the presence of cycloheximide resulted in a reduced number of injured hilar cells compared to rats not pretreated with cycloheximide. Presumed mossy cells, identified by calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) immunohistochemistry, were not significantly reduced in either group 60 days after SE. Whereas controls had a strong band of CGRP-positive fibers (putative mossy cell axons) and no neo-Timm stained fibers in the IML, pilocarpine-treated rats had no CGRP fibers and strong neo-Timm staining. Cycloheximide-pilocarpine-treated animals, in contrast, had CGRP and neo-Timm staining similar to controls. Cycloheximide might protect hilar CGRP-positive cells during SE and, by allowing those cells to retain their normal axonal projection, prevent mossy fiber sprouting. The recently suggested ``irritable'' mossy cell hypothesis relies on the survival of mossy cells for network hyperexcitability. We hypothesized that CGRP may be a marker for a subpopulation of relatively resistant mossy cells in rats, which, if they survive injury, may become irritable and contribute to hyperexcitability. We suggest that cycloheximide prevents SE-induced mossy fiber sprouting by preventing the loss of hilar CGRP-positive cells (putative mossy cells).",

abstract = "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is contained in at least four types of GABAergic interneurons in the dentate gyrus, many of which also contain somatostatin and give rise to the dense NPY innervation of the dentate outer molecular layer. In humans but not rats, minute amounts of NPY are also normally expressed in dentate granule cells, while seizure activity in rats induces robust NPY expression in granule cells. Y1 and Y2 receptors are the most abundant NPY receptors expressed in the dentate gyrus. Y1 receptors are postsynaptic receptors, primarily located on granule cell dendrites in the molecular layer and some interneurons, while Y2 receptors are presynaptic receptors mediating inhibition of glutamate release, and potentially that of NPY and GABA depending on their presynaptic localization, and may also be expressed on some hilar interneurons. In humans, monkeys and mice, Y2 receptors are also present on mossy fibers, but not in most rat species, though functional evidence suggests their presence. Hilar interneurons containing NPY degenerate in temporal lobe epilepsy and in Alzheimer's disease and reduced levels of NPY in dentate hilus are associated with depression. By activating Y1 receptors, NPY also exerts powerful neuroproliferative effects on subgranular zone progenitor cells, increasing the number of newly born granule cells in the adult dentate gyrus. Functionally, NPY exerts anticonvulsive actions mediated by Y2 receptors at mossy fiber terminals, but there are no presynaptic responses to NPY at perforant path inputs to dentate granule cells in rats or mice. NPY also has potentially complicated actions on NPY-containing interneurons. Elevated expression of NPY in mossy fibers of the rat, sprouting of NPY interneurons in the human dentate, and over-expression of Y2 receptors in mossy fibers indicate an anticonvulsive role of endogenous NPY in epilepsy. However, the physiological role of NPY in the healthy dentate gyrus remains unclear.",

Of the ionotropic receptors, NMDARs and AMPARs have been extensively studied for decades, while relatively fewer studies have focused on the role of the KARs in the glutamatergic synapse. Despite this, there is considerable experimental data that suggest a major role for KARs in modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity, particularly in the hippocampal formation, as well as an involvement in disease states. KARs mediate most aspects of kainate-induced seizures and excitotoxic cell death, and thus, are a rational drug target for antiepileptic drug discovery. Recent data from human studies have also highlighted a role for KARs in certain psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia and major depression, and a recent association of KAR gene variants with response to antidepressants has brought considerable interest in developing a clearer understanding of KAR action in the brain. We have recently found that exposure to stress and stress hormone administration can produce contrasting changes in KAR subunit expression in the rat hippocampus, suggesting that a modification of hippocampal KARs by stress may be a mechanism for predisposing individuals to stress-related psychiatric diseases. Here, we review the anatomical and functional characteristics of hippocampal KARs, their role in synaptic plasticity, their regulation by certain hormones, and briefly review what is known about their involvement in disease states such as epilepsy and depression.",

Several different mechanisms probably exist, and most research has focused on seizure-related respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmia, cerebral depression, and autonomic dysfunction. Data from a pooled analysis of risk factors indicate that the higher the frequency of tonic-clonic seizures, the higher the risk of SUDEP; furthermore, risk of SUDEP is also elevated in male patients, patients with long-duration epilepsy, and those on antiepileptic polytherapy. SUDEP usually occurs when the seizures are not witnessed and often at night. In this Seminar, we provide advice to clinicians on ways to minimise the risk of SUDEP, information to pass on to patients, and medicolegal aspects of these deaths.",

Although the presence of this interictal emotionality has been well documented, little progress has been made in identifying its precise nature and cause because it is not amenable to experimental analysis in clinical populations. Accordingly, there is much to gain by studying the fundamental nature and neural basis of interictal emotionality using animal models. Kindling is a widely studied animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy in which daily electrical stimulation of certain brain regions results in the gradual progression and intensification of limbic motor seizures. Several investigators have found that partial and short-term kindling produce robust changes in emotional behavior in both cats and rats. Recently, our laboratory has developed a new model to study interictal emotionality using long-term kindling in rats. These long-term kindled rats display profound changes in fearful and defensive behavior which last for at least two months after the final stimulation. We are now beginning to use this model to study the neural mechanisms underlying the development and expression of interictal emotionality.",

Surprisingly, the majority of developmental seizures are not spontaneous but are provoked by injurious or stressful stimuli. What mechanisms mediate `triggering' of seizures and limit such reactive seizures to early postnatal life? Recent evidence implicates the excitatory neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Stress activates expression of the CRH gene in several limbic regions, and CRH-expressing neurons are strategically localized in the immature rat hippocampus, in which this neuropeptide increases the excitability of pyramidal cells in vitro. Indeed, in vivo, activation of CRH receptors---maximally expressed in hippocampus and amygdala during the developmental period which is characterized by peak susceptibility to `provoked' convulsions---induces severe, age-dependent seizures. Thus, converging data indicate that activation of expression of CRH constitutes an important mechanism for generating developmentally regulated, triggered seizures, with considerable clinical relevance.

Olfactory stimulation with toluene was able to suppress seizures in most kindled rats after stimulation at 20\% above the threshold for eliciting epileptic afterdischarges. Olfactory stimulation with toluene or ammonia increased the threshold by 27 and 25\% compared to control conditions. Our data substantiate that olfactory brain regions, such as the piriform cortex, are involved in amygdala-kindled seizures and suggest that strong physiological stimulation of this nucleus interferes with on-going seizure activity in the limbic system.

abstract = "The clinical and basic literature suggest that hilar cells of the dentate gyrus are damaged after seizures, particularly prolonged and repetitive seizures. Of the cell types within the hilus, it appears that the mossy cell is one of the most vulnerable. Nevertheless, hilar neurons which resemble mossy cells appear in some published reports of animal models of epilepsy, and in some cases of human temporal lobe epilepsy. Therefore, mossy cells may not always be killed after severe, repeated seizures. However, mossy cell survival in these studies was not completely clear because the methods did allow discrimination between mossy cells and other hilar cell types. Furthermore, whether surviving mossy cells might have altered physiology after seizures was not examined. Therefore, intracellular recording and intracellular dye injection were used to characterize hilar cells in hippocampal slices from pilocarpine-treated rats that had status epilepticus and recurrent seizures ('epileptic' rats). For comparison, mossy cells were also recorded from age-matched, saline-injected controls, and pilocarpine-treated rats that failed to develop status epilepticus. Numerous hilar cells with the morphology, axon projection, and membrane properties of mossy cells were recorded in all three experimental groups. Thus, mossy cells can survive severe seizures, and those that survive retain many of their normal characteristics. However, mossy cells from epileptic tissue were distinct from mossy cells of control rats in that they generated spontaneous and evoked epileptiform burst discharges. Area CA3 pyramidal cells also exhibited spontaneous and evoked bursts. Simultaneous intracellular recordings from mossy cells and pyramidal cells demonstrated that their burst discharges were synchronized, with pyramidal cell discharges typically beginning first. From these data we suggest that hilar mossy cells can survive status epilepticus and chronic seizures. The fact that mossy cells have epileptiform bursts, and that they are synchronized with area CA3, suggest a previously unappreciated substrate for hyperexcitability in this animal model.",

Most of the clinical studies are retrospective and anecdotal, and the few studies we have reviewed do not shed any clear light on the nature of the relationship. There are several inherent problems that render the cause-effect relationship between stress and seizures difficult to establish: (a) Stress is difficult to quantify, and there are marked individual differences; (b) stress can cause anxiety with hyperventilation, sleep deprivation, depression, noncompliance with antiepilepric drugs, increased alcohol intake, and all of these may, in turn, contribute to seizures; (c) seizures themselves can cause stress, which may subsequently aggravate seizures; and (d) EEG changes under stress fail to provide convincing evidence of increased epileptogenicity. In the review of the basic science research, we find no definite proconvulsant effects related to catecholamines, although we note possible associations of seizure/stress to corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), serotonin, ACTH, steroids, and GABA.",

abstract = "Activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors produces oscillations in the hippocampal slice that resemble the theta rhythm, but also may produce abnormal synchronous activity that is more characteristic of epileptiform activity. We used pilocarpine, a muscarinic agonist and convulsant, and an elevation in extracellular potassium (5-7.5 mM) to produce synchronous neuronal activity that was prolonged (>2 s) and mimicked synchronization noted during seizures in vivo (ictal activity). In the CA3 region of adult rat hippocampal slices, prolonged ictal oscillations consisted of rhythmic field potentials occurring at 4-10 Hz for up to 30 s (ictal duration) that occurred in a regular periodic pattern every 12-166 s (ictal interval). The duration and interval between ictal oscillations were measured before and after application of drugs to define determinants of ictal occurrence. High threshold calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine and verapamil) blocked ictal activity. Release of calcium from intracellular stores also appeared to be important for ictal synchronization because ictal activity was blocked by dantrolene, an inhibitor of calcium release from intracellular stores, and by thapsigargin which blocks the ATPase that maintains intracellular calcium stores. These suppressive effects appeared to be postsynaptic because nifedipine, dantrolene, and thapsigargin had no effect on evoked fEPSPs. Enhancement of presynaptic inhibition by activation of GABA(B) or adenosine A(1) receptors suppressed ictal activity and depressed the amplitude of evoked population synaptic potentials. The results point to an important role for high threshold calcium channels and release of calcium from intracellular stores in addition to strength of synaptic connections in generation of prolonged oscillations that underlie seizure activity.",

title = "Do the epilepsies, pain syndromes, and affective disorders share common kindling-like mechanisms?",
author = "Post, Robert M",
abstract = "Kindling, in the classical sense, involves progressively increasing responsivity to the intermittent repetition of the same 1-s subthreshold electrical stimulation over time, with the amygdala being the area most frequently studied. Such repeated subthreshold stimulation is associated with: lowering of the after-discharge (AD) threshold; lengthening and spread of the AD; marked seizure stage progression culminating in full-blown tonic-clonic forelimb convulsions with rearing and falling; and evolution from triggered to spontaneous seizures. This evolving process concomitantly involves changes in the spatio-temporal expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), neurotrophic factors, and late effector genes (LEGs), and an associated changing pattern of effectiveness of different pharmacological interventions. Since seizures are the paradigmatic behavioral manifestation of kindling, some types of pharmacological seizures, such as those induced by the local anesthetics cocaine and lidocaine, and some epileptic syndromes, are most likely homologously modeled by kindling. However, since non-epileptiform syndromes, such as recurrent episodes of affective illness and some pain syndromes possess non-homogenous elements of kindling-like evolution, some of the principles involved in kindling progression may, nonetheless, be pertinent to the understanding and treatment of these syndromes. For example, one could attempt to distinguish between the genes involved in the primary pathological processes of syndrome evolution versus those that are secondary and adaptive; such a differentiation could have important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches targeted to suppressing or enhancing these alterations, respectively. In these instances, inferences drawn from the kindling model are necessarily indirect and circumscribed because different neuroanatomical and biochemical processes are likely involved in the evolution of each neuropsychiatric syndrome. Given these recognized limitations of non-homologous models, kindling may still provide insights into the longitudinal course, progression, and treatment of some neuropsychiatric syndromes that can then be directly tested in the clinic.",

METHODS: Of 94 TLE patients evaluated for epilepsy surgery, 76 underwent a resective procedure, 18 continued on medical treatment alone. Depression (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)) and anxiety scores (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SRAS)) were examined during presurgical evaluation (T1) and after a mean of 16 months (T2), or 12 months after surgery. Depression and anxiety scores were related to type of intervention, underlying epileptogenic lesion, change of seizure control and anticonvulsant therapy. RESULTS: At T1, depression and anxiety scores were higher in patients with TLE than scores in published normal populations. At T2, depression but not anxiety scores were significantly lower than at T1. Change of depression scores interacted with improvements of seizure control. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of depression and anxiety is commonly found in patients with TLE. Depression improves not because of epilepsy surgery per se, but because of improved seizure control. This is more commonly achieved by surgery than medical treatment. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that depression in TLE is caused by pathological epileptic activity rather than a fixed structural defect.",

It is important to remember that this was a treatment for people who had asked for it and for whom time and a therapist was available. It was not a controlled trial but was carried out when we could and at a time when we were experimenting with the best way of using it. Results must therefore be treated with caution and with due regard to other therapeutic factors that may be implicated in the results, both good and bad. We assume that the result (with over a third of the patients using aromatherapy with or without hypnosis becoming seizure free for at least a year) as being the best that could be achieved and likely to be less in a properly controlled trial. Of the three treatments tried (aromatherapy on its own, aromatherapy plus hypnosis and hypnosis without aromatherapy), aromatherapy plus hypnosis seems to have had the best and most lasting effect (a third of patients still seizure free at two years), but was the most labour intensive and needed medical therapist input. Aromatherapy itself might be best reserved as a short-term treatment for people going through a bad time with their seizures. A fuller and more lasting effect may be obtained with aromatherapy plus hypnosis, but this needs a patient who is prepared to put much time and personal effort into the treatment.",

Chronic epilepsy generally impairs cognition, but it also induces processes of functional reorganisation and behavioural compensation. In most idiopathic epilepsies, cognition is only mildly deteriorated or even normal by clinical standards. Localisation-related cryptogenic and symptomatic epilepsy disorders are accompanied by focal deficits that mirror the specific functions of the respective areas. Poor cognitive outcome is generally associated with an early onset and a long duration of the disease and with poor seizure control. There is evidence that cognitive functions are already impaired at the onset of the disease, and that the maturation of cognitive functions in children is susceptible to the adverse influence of epilepsy. In adults, cognitive decline progresses very slowly over decades with an age regression similar to that of people without epilepsy. Successful epilepsy surgery can stop or partly reverse the unfavourable cognitive development, but left-temporal resections in particular have a high risk of additional postoperative verbal memory impairment. Cognitive recovery in the adult brain after successful surgery indicates functional compensation and, to some degree, functional reorganisation or a reactivation of functions previously suppressed by influence from distant but connected epileptogenic areas.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Seizure prediction would be clinically useful in patients with epilepsy and could improve safety, increase independence, and allow acute treatment. We did a multicentre clinical feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of a long-term implanted seizure advisory system designed to predict seizure likelihood and quantify seizures in adults with drug-resistant focal seizures. METHODS: We enrolled patients at three centres in Melbourne, Australia, between March 24, 2010, and June 21, 2011. Eligible patients had between two and 12 disabling partial-onset seizures per month, a lateralised epileptogenic zone, and no history of psychogenic seizures. After devices were surgically implanted, patients entered a data collection phase, during which an algorithm for identification of periods of high, moderate, and low seizure likelihood was established. If the algorithm met performance criteria (ie, sensitivity of high-likelihood warnings greater than 65\% and performance better than expected through chance prediction of randomly occurring events), patients then entered an advisory phase and received information about seizure likelihood. The primary endpoint was the number of device-related adverse events at 4 months after implantation. Our secondary endpoints were algorithm performance at the end of the data collection phase, clinical effectiveness (measures of anxiety, depression, seizure severity, and quality of life) 4 months after initiation of the advisory phase, and longer-term adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01043406. FINDINGS: We implanted 15 patients with the advisory system. 11 device-related adverse events were noted within four months of implantation, two of which were serious (device migration, seroma); an additional two serious adverse events occurred during the first year after implantation (device-related infection, device site reaction), but were resolved without further complication. The device met enabling criteria in 11 patients upon completion of the data collection phase, with high likelihood performance estimate sensitivities ranging from 65\% to 100\%. Three patients' algorithms did not meet performance criteria and one patient required device removal because of an adverse event before sufficient training data were acquired. We detected no significant changes in clinical effectiveness measures between baseline and 4 months after implantation. INTERPRETATION: This study showed that intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring is feasible in ambulatory patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. If these findings are replicated in larger, longer studies, accurate definition of preictal electrical activity might improve understanding of seizure generation and eventually lead to new management strategies.

SUDEP excludes other forms of seizure-related sudden death that might be mechanistically related (eg, death after single febrile, unprovoked seizures, or status epilepticus). Typically, postictal apnoea and bradycardia progress to asystole and death. A crucial element of SUDEP is brainstem dysfunction, for which postictal generalised EEG suppression might be a biomarker. Dysfunction in serotonin and adenosine signalling systems, as well as genetic disorders affecting cardiac conduction and neuronal excitability, might also contribute. Because generalised tonic-clonic seizures precede most cases of SUDEP, patients must be better educated about prevention.

We aimed to assess the contribution of ultra-rare genetic variation to common epilepsies. METHODS: We did a case-control sequencing study with exome sequence data from unrelated individuals clinically evaluated for one of the two most common epilepsy syndromes: familial genetic generalised epilepsy, or familial or sporadic non-acquired focal epilepsy. Individuals of any age were recruited between Nov 26, 2007, and Aug 2, 2013, through the multicentre Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project and Epi4K collaborations, and samples were sequenced at the Institute for Genomic Medicine (New York, USA) between Feb 6, 2013, and Aug 18, 2015. To identify epilepsy risk signals, we tested all protein-coding genes for an excess of ultra-rare genetic variation among the cases, compared with control samples with no known epilepsy or epilepsy comorbidity sequenced through unrelated studies. FINDINGS: We separately compared the sequence data from 640 individuals with familial genetic generalised epilepsy and 525 individuals with familial non-acquired focal epilepsy to the same group of 3877 controls, and found significantly higher rates of ultra-rare deleterious variation in genes established as causative for dominant epilepsy disorders (familial genetic generalised epilepsy: odd ratio [OR] 2·3, 95\% CI 1·7-3·2, p=9·1 $\times$ 10-8; familial non-acquired focal epilepsy 3·6, 2·7-4·9, p=1·1 $\times$ 10-17). Comparison of an additional cohort of 662 individuals with sporadic non-acquired focal epilepsy to controls did not identify study-wide significant signals. For the individuals with familial non-acquired focal epilepsy, we found that five known epilepsy genes ranked as the top five genes enriched for ultra-rare deleterious variation. After accounting for the control carrier rate, we estimate that these five genes contribute to the risk of epilepsy in approximately 8\% of individuals with familial non-acquired focal epilepsy. Our analyses showed that no individual gene was significantly associated with familial genetic generalised epilepsy; however, known epilepsy genes had lower p values relative to the rest of the protein-coding genes (p=5·8 $\times$ 10-8) that were lower than expected from a random sampling of genes. INTERPRETATION: We identified excess ultra-rare variation in known epilepsy genes, which establishes a clear connection between the genetics of common and rare, severe epilepsies, and shows that the variants responsible for epilepsy risk are exceptionally rare in the general population. Our results suggest that the emerging paradigm of targeting of treatments to the genetic cause in rare devastating epilepsies might also extend to a proportion of common epilepsies. These findings might allow clinicians to broadly explain the cause of these syndromes to patients, and lay the foundation for possible precision treatments in the future.

author = "{GBD 2016 Epilepsy Collaborators}",
abstract = "BACKGROUND: Seizures and their consequences contribute to the burden of epilepsy because they can cause health loss (premature mortality and residual disability). Data on the burden of epilepsy are needed for health-care planning and resource allocation. The aim of this study was to quantify health loss due to epilepsy by age, sex, year, and location using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. METHODS: We assessed the burden of epilepsy in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. Burden was measured as deaths, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; a summary measure of health loss defined by the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] for premature mortality and years lived with disability), by age, sex, year, location, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI; a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility). Vital registrations and verbal autopsies provided information about deaths, and data on the prevalence and severity of epilepsy largely came from population representative surveys. All estimates were calculated with 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs). FINDINGS: In 2016, there were 45·9 million (95\% UI 39·9-54·6) patients with all-active epilepsy (both idiopathic and secondary epilepsy globally; age-standardised prevalence 621·5 per 100 000 population; 540·1-737·0). Of these patients, 24·0 million (20·4-27·7) had active idiopathic epilepsy (prevalence 326·7 per 100 000 population; 278·4-378·1). Prevalence of active epilepsy increased with age, with peaks at 5-9 years (374·8 [280·1-490·0]) and at older than 80 years of age (545·1 [444·2-652·0]). Age-standardised prevalence of active idiopathic epilepsy was 329·3 per 100 000 population (280·3-381·2) in men and 318·9 per 100 000 population (271·1-369·4) in women, and was similar among SDI quintiles. Global age-standardised mortality rates of idiopathic epilepsy were 1·74 per 100 000 population (1·64-1·87; 1·40 per 100 000 population [1·23-1·54] for women and 2·09 per 100 000 population [1·96-2·25] for men). Age-standardised DALYs were 182·6 per 100 000 population (149·0-223·5; 163·6 per 100 000 population [130·6-204·3] for women and 201·2 per 100 000 population [166·9-241·4] for men). The higher DALY rates in men were due to higher YLL rates compared with women. Between 1990 and 2016, there was a non-significant 6·0\% (-4·0 to 16·7) change in the age-standardised prevalence of idiopathic epilepsy, but a significant decrease in age-standardised mortality rates (24·5\% [10·8 to 31·8]) and age-standardised DALY rates (19·4\% [9·0 to 27·6]). A third of the difference in age-standardised DALY rates between low and high SDI quintile countries was due to the greater severity of epilepsy in low-income settings, and two-thirds were due to a higher YLL rate in low SDI countries. INTERPRETATION: Despite the decrease in the disease burden from 1990 to 2016, epilepsy is still an important cause of disability and mortality. Standardised collection of data on epilepsy in population representative surveys will strengthen the estimates, particularly in countries for which we currently have no or sparse data and if additional data is collected on severity, causes, and treatment. Sizeable gains in reducing the burden of epilepsy might be expected from improved access to existing treatments in low-income countries and from the development of new effective drugs worldwide.

A consecutive series of 12 patients with ictal fear underwent psychiatric evaluation, via either formal consultation with a psychiatrist or standardized interview using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview; the latter was addended to create an instrument specifically for use in epilepsy patients (MINI-Epi).Results. Four of the twelve patients (33\%) with ictal fear had a comorbid diagnosis of panic disorder. One of these developed panic attacks only after epilepsy surgery, and another worsened after surgery, while in the other two panic attacks were not related to any surgical procedure. Two patients had other anxiety disorders. Eight patients (67\%) had current or past depression; this did not appear to be related to the presence of panic disorder.Conclusion. A specific comorbidity exists between focal epilepsy with ictal fear and panic disorder. Involvement of the amygdala in both temporal lobe epilepsy and panic disorder may underlie this. The predisposition to panic disorder in these patients may be exacerbated by anterior temporal lobectomy.",

In 2002, all children (n=10) whose first epileptic seizure was related to a stressful event had a ``stable'' condition, whereas 4 of 10 children whose first epileptic seizure was not stress-related had an ``unstable'' condition. Typical absence seizures were observed in 6 of 10 children in the stress-related group and none in the non-stress-related patient group. Stressful life events can be provocative factors for the occurrence of epileptic seizures. Typical absence seizures are more likely to be provoked by stress then other types of epileptic seizures.",

Anxiety symptoms themselves may be present as intrinsic aspects of seizure phenomena, either during the events or closely related to them. The pathways of stress and anxiety involve the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and explain at least in part how stress may lead to worsening seizure control.

The cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying these diverse functions overlap extensively. At the cellular level, the intrinsic properties of dentate granule cells combine to endow these neurons with a fundamental reluctance to activate, one of their hallmark traits. At the circuit level, the dentate gyrus constitutes one of the more heavily inhibited regions of the brain, with strong, fast feedforward and feedback GABAergic inhibition dominating responses to afferent activation. In pathologic states such as epilepsy, a number of alterations within the dentate gyrus combine to compromise the regulatory properties of this circuit, culminating in a collapse of its normal function. This epilepsy-associated transformation in the fundamental properties of this critical regulatory hippocampal circuit may contribute both to seizure propensity, and cognitive and emotional comorbidities characteristic of this disease state.",

abstract = "Abstract When studying the pathological mechanisms of epilepsy, there are a seemingly endless number of approaches from the ultrastructural level---receptor expression by EM---to the behavioral level---comorbid depression in behaving animals. Epilepsy is characterized as a disorder of recurrent seizures, which are defined as ``a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain'' (Fisher et al., 2005). Such abnormal activity typically does not occur in a single isolated neuron; rather, it results from pathological activity in large groups---or circuits---of neurons. Here we choose to focus on two aspects of aberrant circuits in temporal lobe epilepsy: their organization and potential mechanisms to control these pathological circuits. We also look at two scales: microcircuits, ie, the relationship between individual neurons or small groups of similar neurons, and macrocircuits, ie, the organization of large-scale brain regions. We begin by summarizing the large body of literature that describes the stereotypical anatomical changes in the temporal lobe---ie, the anatomical basis of alterations in microcircuitry. We then offer a brief introduction to graph theory and describe how this type of mathematical analysis, in combination with computational neuroscience techniques and using parameters obtained from experimental data, can be used to postulate how microcircuit alterations may lead to seizures. We then zoom out and look at the changes which are seen over large whole-brain networks in patients and animal models, and finally we look to the future.",

abstract = "Focal epilepsies, where seizures initiate in spatially limited networks, are the most frequent epilepsy type, accounting for two-thirds of patients. Focal epilepsies have long been thought to be acquired disorders; several focal epilepsy syndromes are now proven to be (genetically heterogeneous) monogenic disorders. While earlier genetic studies have demonstrated a strong contribution of ion channel and neurotransmitter receptor genes, or synaptic secreted protein genes, later work has revealed a new class of genes encoding components of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway. The mTOR pathway controls a myriad of biological processes among which cell growth and protein synthesis in response to several extracellular and intracellular. Recently, germline mutations have been found in genes encoding the components of the GATOR1 complex (DEPDC5, NPRL2, NPRL3), a repressor of mTORC1. These mutations are increasingly recognized as causing a wide and yet evolving spectrum of focal epilepsy syndromes, with and without cortical structural abnormalities (usually focal cortical dysplasia). Brain somatic mutations in the gene encoding mTOR (MTOR) have recently been linked to focal cortical dysplasia and other associated brain pathologies including hemimegalencephaly. This chapter reviews the genetics and neurobiology of DEPDC5, NPRL2, and NPRL3, and summarizes the clinical and molecular spectrum of GATOR1-related epilepsies.",

abstract = "Individuals with severe, sporadic disorders of infantile onset represent an important class of disease for which discovery of the underlying genetic architecture is not amenable to traditional genetic analysis. Full-genome sequencing of affected individuals and their parents provides a powerful alternative strategy for gene discovery. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on a family quartet containing an affected proband and her unaffected parents and sibling. The 15-year-old female proband had a severe epileptic encephalopathy consisting of early-onset seizures, features of autism, intellectual disability, ataxia, and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. We discovered a de novo heterozygous missense mutation (c.5302A>G [p.Asn1768Asp]) in the voltage-gated sodium-channel gene SCN8A in the proband. This mutation alters an evolutionarily conserved residue in Nav1.6, one of the most abundant sodium channels in the brain. Analysis of the biophysical properties of the mutant channel demonstrated a dramatic increase in persistent sodium current, incomplete channel inactivation, and a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation. Current-clamp analysis in hippocampal neurons transfected with p.Asn1768Asp channels revealed increased spontaneous firing, paroxysmal-depolarizing-shift-like complexes, and an increased firing frequency, consistent with a dominant gain-of-function phenotype in the heterozygous proband. This work identifies SCN8A as the fifth sodium-channel gene to be mutated in epilepsy and demonstrates the value of WGS for the identification of pathogenic mutations causing severe, sporadic neurological disorders.",

We studied two unrelated children presenting with a distinctive early-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by refractory epilepsy and absent developmental milestones, as well as thick and short corpus callosum and persistent cavum septum pellucidum on brain MRI. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified biallelic mutations in seizure threshold 2 (SZT2) in both affected children. The causative mutations include a homozygous nonsense mutation and a nonsense mutation together with an exonic splice-site mutation in a compound-heterozygous state. The latter mutation leads to exon skipping and premature termination of translation, as shown by RT-PCR in blood RNA of the affected boy. Thus, all three mutations are predicted to result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and/or premature protein truncation and thereby loss of SZT2 function. Although the molecular role of the peroxisomal protein SZT2 in neuronal excitability and brain development remains to be defined, Szt2 has been shown to influence seizure threshold and epileptogenesis in mice, consistent with our findings in humans.

ADLTE is genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in LGI1 account for fewer than 50\% of affected families. Here, we report the identification of causal mutations in reelin (RELN) in seven ADLTE-affected families without LGI1 mutations. We initially investigated 13 ADLTE-affected families by performing SNP-array linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing and identified three heterozygous missense mutations co-segregating with the syndrome. Subsequent analysis of 15 small ADLTE-affected families revealed four additional missense mutations. 3D modeling predicted that all mutations have structural effects on protein-domain folding. Overall, RELN mutations occurred in 7/40 (17.5\%) ADLTE-affected families. RELN encodes a secreted protein, Reelin, which has important functions in both the developing and adult brain and is also found in the blood serum. We show that ADLTE-related mutations significantly decrease serum levels of Reelin, suggesting an inhibitory effect of mutations on protein secretion. We also show that Reelin and LGI1 co-localize in a subset of rat brain neurons, supporting an involvement of both proteins in a common molecular pathway underlying ADLTE. Homozygous RELN mutations are known to cause lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia. Our findings extend the spectrum of neurological disorders associated with RELN mutations and establish a link between RELN and LGI1, which play key regulatory roles in both the developing and adult brain.",

abstract = "Sleep and arousal from sleep are associated with profound changes in cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Fluctuations of arterial blood pressure (ABP), heart rate (HR), and respiration occur both during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep and during transitions between sleep and behavioral arousal. These changes reflect complex, state-dependent interactions among several neuronal groups in the hypothalamus and brainstem. These neurons utilize the excitatory amino-acid L-glutamate or the inhibitory amino acid $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and are modulated in a state-dependent manner by inputs from cholinergic, monoaminergic, and hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons. These different neuronal populations mediate continuous interactions between cortical state and subcortical circuits modulating sympathetic and cardiovagal output, respiratory pattern, and chemosensitivity. Reciprocally, brainstem areas involved in these functions promote behavioral arousal in the setting of hypoxia, hypercapnia, or other stressors. Studies in rodents using optogenetic and other approaches for selective activation or inactivation of specific neuronal groups identified by their unique neurochemical markers, combined with recording of cortical activity, cardiovascular responses, and respiration, have provided new information on the brainstem mechanisms controlling arousal, wake-sleep cycle, cardiovascular and respiratory control (Luppi et al., 2017; Saper and Fuller, 2017; Scammell et al., 2017; Dampney, 2016; Del Negro et al., 2018; Guyenet, 2006; Guyenet and Abbott, 2013; Smith et al., 2013).

Although mounting evidence has verified a functional overlap between dynorphin/KOR and neurotensin/neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) systems, little is known about direct interaction between the two receptors. Here, we showed that KOR and NTSR1 form a heterodimer that functions as a novel pharmacological entity, and this heterodimer, in turn, brings about a switch in KOR-mediated signal transduction, from G protein--dependent to $\beta$-arrestin-2--dependent. This was simultaneously verified by analyzing a KOR mutant (196th residue) that lost the ability to dimerize with NTSR1. We also found that dual occupancy of the heterodimer forced the $\beta$-arrestin-2--dependent pathway back into Gi protein--dependent signaling, according to KOR activation. These data provide new insights into the interaction between KOR and NTSR1, and the newly discovered role of NTSR1 acting as a switch between G protein-- and $\beta$-arrestin--dependent pathways of KOR also suggests a new approach for utilizing pathologically elevated dynorphin/KOR system into full play for its analgesic effect with limited side effects.",

All saline-treated mice with BNST AVP cell ablations consumed more sucrose than did control mice, and males, but not females, with BNST AVP cell ablations showed reduced preference for novel conspecifics compared to control mice.

Herein, we demonstrate that the delivery of SCFAs directly into the brain disrupts social novelty through distinct neuronal populations. We are the first to observe that infusion of SCFAs into the lateral ventricle disrupted social novelty in microbiome-depleted mice without affecting brain inflammatory responses. The deficit in social novelty can be recapitulated by activating calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-labeled neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Conversely, chemogenetic silencing of the CaMKII-labeled neurons and pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in the BNST reversed the SCFAs-induced deficit in social novelty.

To determine the brain regions involved in this altered reward behavior, we examined neural activation (as indexed by Fos-like proteins) induced by a preference test for a food-associated environment in 5-week morphine-abstinent versus non-dependent animals. The results indicate that elevated Fos expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (Cg) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) correlated positively with preference behavior in all groups. In contrast, Fos expression in stress-associated brain areas, including the ventral lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (VL-BNST), central nucleus of the amygdala (CE), and noradrenergic (A2) neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) was significantly elevated only in morphine-abstinent animals. Furthermore, the number of Fos positive neurons in these areas was found to correlate negatively with food preference in abstinent animals.

abstract = "The incidence of psychiatric disturbances is elevated in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. Early life stressful events are believed to have a major impact on mental health later in life, and increasing evidence suggests that such stresses may also promote a vulnerability to TLE. This study investigated whether subjecting rats to early life stress exacerbated mood and cognitive disturbances associated with the development of epilepsy. On postnatal days 2--14, rat pups were separated from their dams for either 180 min/day (handling and maternal separation -- HMS180, modelling early life stress) or 15 min/day (control handling and maternal separation -- HMS15). At 7 weeks, rats were implanted with a bipolar electrode into the left amygdala. Following recovery, one group of rats from each litter underwent rapid amygdala kindling (RAK) epileptogenesis, while another underwent sham kindling. One week following this, rats were subjected to behavioural tests assessing anxiety and cognition. HMS180-exposed rats kindled faster than HMS15 rats (p < 0.0001). RAK induced a potent anxiolytic effect as evidenced by increased \% time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, compared with sham kindled rats (p < 0.0001). This anxiolytic effect was also observed in the open field task, as evidenced by increased time spent in the inner area (p = 0.010). Neither RAK nor maternal separation had any effect on cognitive function in the Morris water maze. We conclude that maternal separation stress accelerates limbic epileptogenesis in adult rats, and that RAK induces potent anxiolytic effects that are not influenced by such early life stressful events.",

Early long-term treatment with VGB could alter the development of absence pathology, by significantly reducing seizure generation and synchronization in contrast to its pro-absence effects observed after acute or subchronic administration. We have demonstrated the antidepressant effects of a sub-chronic treatment with VGB in both wistar and WAG/Rij rats. In contrast, following an early long-term treatment, VGB antidepressant effects were only observable in WAG/Rij rats. In conclusion, VGB has antiepileptogenic and antidepressant properties in the WAG/Rij rat model despite its pro-absence effects suggesting that epilepsy and depression, in this animal model, are directly related and that seizure development inhibition also reduces the development of depressive behaviour.",

abstract = "Rats exposed to the odor of a predator or to the elevated plus maze (EPM) express unique unconditioned fear behaviors. The extended amygdala has previously been demonstrated to mediate the response to both predator odor and the EPM. We seek to determine if divergent amygdalar microcircuits are associated with the different behavioral responses. The current experiments compared activation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-containing neuronal populations in the central amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) of rats exposed to either the EPM (5minutes) versus home cage controls, or predator ferret odor versus butyric acid, or no odor (30minutes). Sections of the brains were prepared for dual-labeled immunohistochemistry and counts of c-Fos co-localized with CRF were made in the centrolateral and centromedial amygdala (CLA and CMA) as well as the dorsolateral (dl), dorsomedial (dm), and ventral (v) BNST. Ferret odor-exposed rats displayed an increase in duration and a decrease in latency of defensive burying versus control rats. Exposure to both predator stress and EPM induced neuronal activation in the BNST, but not the central amygdala, and similar levels of neuronal activation were seen in both the high and low anxiety groups in the BNST after EPM exposure. Dual-labeled immunohistochemistry showed a significant increase in the percentage of CRF/c-Fos co-localization in the vBNST of ferret odor-exposed rats compared to control and butyric acid-exposed groups as well as EPM-exposed rats compared to home cage controls. In addition, an increase in the percentage of CRF-containing neurons co-localized with c-Fos was observed in the dmBNST after EPM exposure. No changes in co-localization of CRF with c-Fos was observed with these treatments in either the CLA or CMA. These results suggest that predator odor and EPM exposure activates CRF neurons in the BNST to a much greater extent than CRF neurons of the central amygdala, and indicates unconditioned anxiogenic stimuli may activate unique anatomical circuits in the extended amygdala.",

abstract = "Clinical evidence shows a strong, bidirectional comorbidity between depression and epilepsy that is associated with decreased quality of life and responsivity to pharmacotherapies. At present, the neurobiological underpinnings of this comorbidity remain hazy. To complicate matters, anticonvulsant drugs can cause mood disturbances, while antidepressant drugs can lower seizure threshold, making it difficult to treat patients suffering from both depression and epilepsy. Animal models have been created to untangle the mechanisms behind the relationship between these disorders and to serve as screening tools for new therapies targeted to treat both simultaneously. These animal models are based on chemical interventions (e.g. pentylenetetrazol, kainic acid, pilocarpine), electrical stimulations (e.g. kindling, electroshock), and genetic/selective breeding paradigms (e.g. genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs), genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), WAG/Rij rats, swim lo-active rats (SwLo)). Studies on these animal models point to some potential mechanisms that could explain epilepsy and depression comorbidity, such as various components of the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic systems, as well as key brain regions, like the amygdala and hippocampus. These models have also been used to screen possible therapies. The purpose of the present review is to highlight the importance of animal models in research on comorbid epilepsy and depression and to explore the contributions of these models to our understanding of the mechanisms and potential treatments for these disorders.",

abstract = "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a catastrophic epileptic encephalopathy characterised by childhood-onset polymorphic seizures, multiple neuropsychiatric comorbidities, and increased risk of sudden death. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in one allele of SCN1A, the gene encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel 1.1 (NaV1.1), lead to DS. NaV1.1 is primarily found in the axon initial segment of fast-spiking GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the brain, and the principle mechanism proposed to underlie seizure genesis in DS is loss of inhibitory input due to dysfunctional firing of GABAergic interneurons. We hypothesised that DS symptoms could be ameliorated by a drug that activates the reduced population of functional NaV1.1 channels in DS interneurons. We recently identified two homologous disulfide-rich spider-venom peptides (Hm1a and Hm1b) that selectively potentiate NaV1.1, and showed that selective activation of NaV1.1 by Hm1a restores the function of inhibitory interneurons in a mouse model of DS. Here we produced recombinant Hm1b (rHm1b) using an E. coli periplasmic expression system, and examined its selectivity against a panel of human NaV subtypes using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. rHm1b is a potent and highly selective agonist of NaV1.1 and NaV1.3 (EC50 ∼12 nM for both). rHm1b is a gating modifier that shifts the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation to hyperpolarised and depolarised potentials respectively, presumably by interacting with the channel's voltage-sensor domains. Like Hm1a, the structure of rHm1b determined by using NMR revealed a classical inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif. However, we show that rHm1b is an order of magnitude more stable than Hm1a in human cerebrospinal fluid. Overall, our data suggest that rHm1b is an exciting lead for a precision therapeutic targeted against DS.",

Based on our previous research along with the current literature, we focus on the role of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and its related neural mechanisms to consider the possible roles of monoaminergic neurons in the modulation of respiration during sleep and the occurrence of SUDEP. Overall, this review suggests that targeting the monoaminergic neurons is a promising approach to preventing SUDEP.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling at the CRF1 receptor (CRF1R) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) can modulate ethanol consumption in rodents. However, the effects of binge-like ethanol drinking on this system have not been thoroughly characterized, and little is known about the role of CRF2R or the CRF neurocircuitry involved. METHODS: The effects of binge-like ethanol consumption on the VTA CRF system were assessed following drinking-in-the-dark procedures. Intra-VTA infusions of selective CRF1R and/or CRF2R compounds were employed to assess the contributions of these receptors in modulating binge-like ethanol consumption (n = 89). To determine the potential role of CRF projections from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to the VTA, CRF neurons in this circuit were chemogenetically inhibited (n = 32). Binge-induced changes in VTA CRF system protein and messenger RNA were also assessed (n = 58). RESULTS: Intra-VTA antagonism of CRF1R and activation of CRF2R resulted in decreased ethanol intake, which was eliminated by simultaneous blockade of both receptors. Chemogenetic inhibition of local CRF neurons in the VTA did not alter binge-like ethanol drinking, but inhibition of VTA-projecting CRF neurons from the BNST significantly reduced intake. CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel evidence that 1) blunted binge-like ethanol consumption stemming from CRF1R blockade requires intact CRF2R signaling, and CRF2R activation reduces binge-like drinking; 2) inhibiting VTA-projecting BNST CRF neurons attenuates binge-like drinking; and 3) binge-like ethanol drinking alters protein and messenger RNA associated with the VTA-CRF system. These data suggest that ethanol-induced activation of BNST-to-VTA CRF projections is critical in driving binge-like ethanol intake.",

abstract = "Although the amygdala plays an important part in the pathogenesis of anxiety and generation of exteroceptive fear, recent discoveries have challenged the directionality of this brain-behavior relationship with respect to interoceptive fear. Here we highlight several paradoxical findings including: (1) amygdala lesion patients who experience excessive fear and panic following inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO2), (2) clinically anxious patients who have significantly smaller (rather than larger) amygdalae and a pronounced hypersensitivity toward CO2, and (3) epilepsy patients who exhibit apnea immediately following stimulation of their amygdala yet have no awareness that their breathing has stopped. The above findings elucidate an entirely novel role for the amygdala in the induction of apnea and inhibition of CO2-induced fear. Such a role is plausible given the strong inhibitory connections linking the central nucleus of the amygdala with respiratory and chemoreceptive centers in the brainstem. Based on this anatomical arrangement, we propose a model of Apnea-induced Anxiety (AiA) which predicts that recurring episodes of apnea are being unconsciously elicited by amygdala activation, resulting in transient spikes in CO2 that provoke fear and anxiety, and lead to characteristic patterns of escape and avoidance behavior in patients spanning the spectrum of anxiety. If this new conception of AiA proves to be true, and activation of the amygdala can repeatedly trigger states of apnea outside of one's awareness, then it remains possible that the chronicity of anxiety disorders is being interoceptively driven by a chemoreceptive system struggling to maintain homeostasis in the midst of these breathless states.",

abstract = "Dravet syndrome and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) can both arise due to mutations of SCN1A, the gene encoding the alpha 1 pore-forming subunit of the sodium channel. GEFS+ refers to a familial epilepsy syndrome where at least two family members have phenotypes that fit within the GEFS+ spectrum. The GEFS+ spectrum comprises a range of mild to severe phenotypes varying from classical febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile onset epilepsy syndrome with multiple seizure types, developmental slowing and poor outcome. More than 70\% of patients with Dravet syndrome have mutations of SCN1A; these include both truncation and missense mutations. In contrast, only 10\% of GEFS+ families have SCN1A mutations and these comprise missense mutations. GEFS+ has also been associated with mutations of genes encoding the sodium channel beta 1 subunit, SCN1B, and the GABA(A) receptor gamma 2 subunit, GABRG2. The phenotypic heterogeneity that is characteristic of GEFS+ families is likely to be due to modifier genes. Interpretation of the significance of a SCN1A missense mutation requires a thorough understanding of the phenotypes in the GEFS+ spectrum whereas a de novo truncation mutation is likely to be associated with a severe phenotype. Early recognition of Dravet syndrome is important as aggressive control of seizures may improve developmental outcome.",

abstract = "AIM: Dravet syndrome (DS) is characterized by high epilepsy-related premature mortality with a markedly young age at death, however, autopsy report of sudden unexpected death with DS has been fewer than expected. METHODS: We report two autopsy cases with sudden unexpected death from DS. Case 1 was a 13-year-old male who drowned in a bathtub, and Case 2 was a 3-year-old female who died while sleeping. In Case 1, the blood concentration of the anticonvulsant, valproic acid, was below the recommended therapeutic range. Neuropathological investigation and genetic analysis of 402 cardiovascular disease-related and 146 epilepsy-related genes by next generation sequencing were applied. RESULTS: No significant neuronal loss with gliosis was observed in the brain of either patient. Although possible mild malformations of cortical development were found in both, the degree thereof was similar to that of age-matched controls. Genetic analysis identified a novel variant in SCN1A intron 23 (c.4477-3T > C) in Case 1 that falls outside of the minor splicing consensus sequence. In vitro splicing functional assays with minigene constructs revealed that this intronic variant leads to a 2-bp insertion immediately before exon 24 that results in protein truncation. Similarly, a novel de novo missense mutation of unknown significance, SCN1A\_Arg187Pro, was identified in Case 2. In both cases, we also identified cardiomyopathy-related variants classified as likely pathogenic; however, the effect of these variants at death was minimal because there was an absence of pathological change indicating inherited cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSION: The present cases emphasize the need for multifaceted examination of DS cases so as to obtain a definitive autopsy diagnosis and to explore the mechanism of sudden unexpected death.",

abstract = "Latency between an early neurological insult and development of spontaneous recurrent seizures suggests aberrant chronological reorganization in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis associated epilepsy. Kainate-induced status similarly results in delayed development of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Mossy fiber sprouting by the dentate granule cells is a well-characterized manifestation of such temporal structural reorganization in both patients and animal models. However, alterations in other components of hippocampal circuitry have not been evaluated. We present results from studies using precise anterograde and retrograde tract tracing methodologies to evaluate the reorganization of outflow of the CA3 pyramidal cells. Although septotemporal relationships of the normal CA3 outflow tract through the Schaffer collaterals are well known, their aberrant reorganization following kainate-induced spontaneous recurrent seizures is not known. We provide the first definitive evidence of widespread CA3 structural reorganization in the form of sprouting of CA3 axons to widespread areas throughout the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. This includes an apparent increase in the density of projection to areas that normally receive CA3 outflow such as CA1 and subiculum as well as novel projections beyond the confines of the hippocampus to the pre and parasubiculum and medial and lateral entorhinal cortex. We provide the first evidence of novel CA3 Schaffer collateral projection to the entorhinal cortex. The sprouting of CA3 outflow to widespread regions of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex may provide insight into how the injured hippocampus propagates unconventional impulse excitation to cortical fields which have a critical role in providing excitatory inputs into the hippocampus possibly setting up reverberating excitatory circuits as well as widespread connections throughout the cortical mantle. Sprouting-related mechanisms may also explain the latency associated with development of spontaneous recurrent seizures, the hallmark of temporal lobe epilepsy.",

Genetic predisposition is common for many of the generalized epilepsy syndromes, and mutations in genes encoding neuronal ion channels are causative in many cases. We previously identified a locus for juvenile audiogenic monogenic seizures (jams1) in the Black Swiss mouse strain, delimited by the gene basigin (Bsg) and the marker D10Mit140. This region includes Hcn2, the gene encoding the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit 2 (HCN2), an ion channel implicated in epilepsy. By sequencing genomic DNA, we found that Black Swiss mice have a single polymorphism in exon 2 within the Hcn2 gene. This single G/C to A/T base change alters the third position of a codon specifying alanine residue 293, without changing the predicted amino acid sequence. Furthermore, we found no detectable differences in HCN2 protein expression in the brains of Black Swiss mice, compared to control mice. We therefore reason that juvenile audiogenic seizures in Black Swiss mice are unlikely to be due to abnormalities of HCN2 channel function.",

author = "Forcelli, Patrick A and Orefice, Lauren L and Heinrichs, Stephen C",
abstract = "The El mouse strain provides a non-induced model of idiopathic, multifactorial epilepsy in which seizures are elicited in response to stressful environmental stimuli such as tail suspension handling. In the present studies, genetically seizure susceptible El and non-susceptible ddY control mice were exposed to tail suspension, foot-shock and social stressors in order to test the hypothesis that neural and physiological responses to such stimuli would be exaggerated in the El strain. The first experiment assessed neural cell density, stress neuropeptide (corticotropin releasing factor---CRF) levels, and plasma corticosterone activation in El and ddY mice in an unhandled control condition or following exposure to tail suspension or foot-shock stressors. The second experiment assessed brain electroencephalographic activity using telemetrically monitored skull surface electrodes in El and ddY mice exposed to tail suspension or social interaction stressors. Assessment of El mouse brains revealed higher cell counts in amygdala and elevated CRF peptide content in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus relative to ddY controls. El mice exhibited significantly elevated plasma corticosterone levels 60 min following exposure to tail suspension and foot-shock stressors relative to ddY controls. Finally, El mice exhibited significantly elevated brain electroencephalographic (1--4 Hz) activity in response to tail suspension, but not social interaction, relative to ddY controls. These results indicate that potentiated neural, endocrine and physiological activation arises in the El strain following exposure to a known seizure trigger stimulus, involuntary tail suspension handling. The findings support a diathesis-stress hypothesis in which genetically seizure susceptible El mice exhibit a multifaceted hyperreactivity to noxious environmental stimuli.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder in human beings and the long-term pathological events remain largely obscure. We are interested in elucidating long-term brain injury that may occur in the temporal lobe epilepsy, and time-course of neuronal death was examined in a mouse pilocarpine model of chronic epilepsy by Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) dye that can specifically stain the degenerative neurons in the central nervous system. The FJC stain combined with immunohistochemistry to neuronal nuclear specific protein revealed that pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) resulted in massive degenerative death of neuronal cells in brains with their dense distribution in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The FJC-positive degenerating neurons, most of them also expressed apoptosis signaling molecules such as caspase-9 and activated caspase-3, occurred at 4h, increased into peak levels at 12h--3d, and then gradually went down at 7d--14d after onset of SE. More interestingly, a large percentage (about 88\%) of FJC-positive degenerative neurons were GABAergic as indicated with their immunoreactivity to glutamic acid decarboxylase-67, implying that inhibitory function of GABAergic neural system might by seriously damaged in brains subject to SE attack in this mouse pilocarpine model. Taken together with previous studies, time-course of degenerative neurons in the mouse pilocarpine model by Fluoro-Jade C staining further benefits understanding of long-term brain pathological changes and recurrent seizure mechanism, and may also result in finding the most suitable time-window in therapeutic manipulation of the chronic epilepsy in human beings.",

author = "Falenski, Katherine W and Carter, Dawn S and Harrison, Anne J and Martin, Billy R and Blair, Robert E and DeLorenzo, Robert J",
abstract = "Several reports have focused on the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in hyperexcitability, particularly in seizure and epilepsy models. Our laboratory recently characterized a novel plasticity change of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor in hippocampi of epileptic rats following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). This long-term redistribution included selective layer-specific changes in CB1 receptor expression within distinct hippocampal subregions. However, the temporal characteristics of this redistribution during the development of epilepsy had not been examined. Therefore, this study was initiated to evaluate the time course by which pilocarpine-induced SE produced changes in CB1 receptor expression. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that within 1 week following SE, there was a pronounced loss in CB1 receptor expression throughout the hippocampus, while staining in many interneurons was preserved. By 1 month post-SE, pilocarpine-treated animals began to display epileptic seizures, and CB1 receptor expression was characteristic of the redistribution observed in long-term epileptic rats, with decreases in CB1 receptor immunoreactivity in the stratum pyramidale neuropil and dentate gyrus inner molecular layer, and increases in the strata oriens and radiatum of CA1--3. Observed changes in CB1 receptor expression were confirmed at multiple time points by western blot analysis. The data indicate that overall decreases in expression following SE preempt a long-lasting CB1 receptor redistribution, and that differential responses occur within the hippocampus to initial CB1 receptor losses. This suggests a role for dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system during epileptogenesis and indicates that the CB1 receptor redistribution temporally correlates with the emergence of epileptic seizures.",

author = "Panguluri, Siva and Saggu, Shalini and Lundy, Robert",
abstract = "Several forebrain areas have been shown to project to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and exert inhibitory and excitatory influences on taste processing. The neurochemicals by which descending forebrain inputs modulate neural taste-evoked responses remain to be established. This study investigated the existence of somatostatin (SS) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) in forebrain neurons that project to caudal regions of the PBN responsive to chemical stimulation of the anterior tongue as well as more rostral unresponsive regions. Retrograde tracer was iontophoretically or pressure ejected from glass micropipettes, and 7 days later the animals were euthanized for subsequent immunohistochemical processing for co-localization of tracer with SS and CRF in tissue sections containing the lateral hypothalamus (LH), central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and insular cortex (IC). In each forebrain site, robust labeling of cells with distinguishable nuclei and short processes was observed for SS and CRF. The results indicate that CRF neurons in each forebrain site send projections throughout the rostral caudal extent of the PBN with a greater percentage terminating in regions rostral to the anterior tongue-responsive area. For SS, the percentage of double-labeled neurons was more forebrain site specific in that only BNST and CeA exhibited significant numbers of double-labeled neurons. Few retrogradely labeled cells in LH co-expressed SS, while no double-labeled cells were observed in IC. Again, tracer injections into rostral PBN resulted in a greater percentage of double-labeled neurons in BNST and CeA compared to caudal injections. The present results suggest that some sources of descending forebrain input might utilize somatostatin and/or CRF to exert a broad influence on sensory information processing in the PBN.",

In contrast, GluR5 expression in the hippocampus of macaques treated with Coriaria lactone was not upregulated compared to the control. In addition, mossy fiber sprouting in the hippocampus of TLE patients was correlated with GluR5 upregulation, whereas mossy fiber sprouting was not observed in the macaque model lacking GluR5 upregulation, suggesting that GluR5 function is mainly associated with mossy fiber sprouting.",

author = "Rijkers, Kim and Aalbers, Marlien and Hoogland, Govert and van Winden, Larissa and Vles, Johannes and Steinbusch, Harry and Majoie, Marian",
abstract = "PURPOSE: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a moderately effective anti-epileptic treatment. Clinically relevant animal models that are suitable to study the mechanism of action of VNS are not available. The aim of the current study was to develop a clinically relevant animal model for VNS-treated epilepsy that can be used to study the mechanism of action of VNS. METHODS: The anticonvulsive effect of VNS was studied in fully kindled rats by measuring behavioral and electrophysiological parameters. Afferent vagus nerve activation was confirmed by quantifying nNOS immunoreactive cells in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). RESULTS: VNS rats had more nNOS immunoreactive cells/mm(2) in the NTS than shams. VNS induced a >25\% decrease in stage 5 duration (S5D) in 32\% of rats. Prior to VNS this type of responders suffered from seizures with a longer total seizure duration (TSD) than non-responders. In 21\% of rats VNS resulted in a >25\% decrease in TSD. This type of responders had a shorter TSD prior to VNS than non-responders. In 29\% of rats VNS resulted in >200\% increase in stage 5 latency (S5L). This type of responders had higher kindling rates than non-responders. CONCLUSION: The VNS-treated kindled rat is a clinically relevant animal model because it is a chronic epilepsy model that responds to VNS with effects that are comparable to the effects of VNS in epilepsy patients. In addition, this study demonstrates that VNS-treated kindled rats can be used to study the mode of action of VNS using immunohistochemical techniques.",

abstract = "Repeated seizures induce permanent alterations of the brain in experimental models and patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is a common form of epilepsy in humans. Together with cell loss and gliosis in many brain regions, synaptic reorganization is observed principally in the hippocampus. However, in the amygdala this synaptic reorganization has been not studied. The changes in Zn density, synaptophysin and MAP2 as markers of reactive synaptogenesis in medial extended amygdala induced by kainic acid (KA) as a model of TLE was studied. Adult male rats (n = 6) were perfused at 10 days, 1, 2, 3 and 4 months after KA i.p. injection (9 mg/kg). Controls were injected with saline. The brains were processed by the Timm's method to reveal synaptic Zn and analyzed by densitometry. Immunohistochemistry was used to reveal synaptophysin and MAP2 expression. A two-way ANOVA was used for statistics, with a P < 0.05 as a significance limit. Normal dark staining was seen in all medial extended amygdala subdivisions of control animals. At 10 days post KA injection a dramatic loss of staining was observed. A slow but steady recovery of Zn density can be followed in the 4 month period studied. Parallel, from 10 days to 2 months stronger synaptophysin expression could be observed, whereas MAP2 expression increased from 1 month with peak levels at 3--4 months. The results suggest that a process of sprouting exists in surviving neurons of medial extended amygdala after status epilepticus and that these neurons might be an evidence of a reactive synaptogenesis process.",

author = "Faingold, Carl L and Randall, Marcus and Mhaskar, Yashanad and Uteshev, Victor V",
abstract = "DBA mice are models of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) that exhibit audiogenic generalized convulsive seizures (GCS), ending in death due to respiratory arrest (RA). Serotonin (5-HT) normally enhances respiration in response to elevated CO(2) levels, which occur during GCS in patients. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), blocks GCS-induced SUDEP in both DBA/2 and DBA/1 mice. This study examined the effects of a 5-HT(2B/2C) agonist (m-chlorophenylpiperazine, mCPP) to test the generality of serotonergic effects on DBA mice. In DBA/2 mice mCPP pre-treatment [5 or 10 (but not 2) mg/kg, i.p.] significantly reduced RA incidence without blocking seizure susceptibility. However, in DBA/1 mice mCPP in doses up to 40mg/kg was ineffective in blocking seizure-induced RA, and 60mg/kg was toxic. The cause of this strain difference was perplexing. Previous studies showed that brainstem 5-HT receptor protein expression was abnormal in DBA/2 mice. Therefore, expression of 5-HT receptor proteins in the medial-caudal brainstem of DBA/1 mice was evaluated using Western blots. In DBA1/mice 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(3B) receptor expression levels were significantly reduced, as seen previously in DBA/2 mice. However, 5-HT(2B) receptor expression was also reduced in DBA/1 mice, contrasting with the 5-HT(2B) receptor elevation seen in DBA/2 mice. This difference may explain the differential effects of the 5-HT(2B/2C) agonist in these SUDEP models. mCPP blocked RA in DBA/2 mice and concomitantly reduced tonic seizures, which also occurs. Fluoxetine is the only agent tested that blocks RA selectively in these SUDEP models, which may be clinically relevant.",

abstract = "The therapeutic efficacy of regular physical exercises in an animal model of epilepsy and depression comorbidity has been confirmed previously. In the present study, we examined the effects of endurance training on susceptibility to kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), behavioral changes and neuronal damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Male SHRs were randomly divided into two groups. One group was exercised on a treadmill with submaximal loading for four weeks and the other group was sedentary. Immediately after the training period, SE was evoked in half of the sedentary and trained rats by KA, while the other half of the two groups received saline. Basal systolic (SP), diastolic (DP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of all rats were measured at the beginning and at the end of the training period. Anxiety, memory and depression-like behaviour were evaluated a month after SE. The release of 5-HT in the hippocampus was measured using a liquid scintillation method and neuronal damage was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. SP and MAP of exercised SHRs decreased in comparison with the initial values. The increased resistance of SHRs to KA-induced SE was accompanied by an elongated latent seizure-free period, improved object recognition memory and antidepressant effect after the training program. While the anticonvulsant and positive behavioral effects of endurance training were accompanied by an increase of 5-HT release in the hippocampus, it did not exert neuroprotective activity. Our results indicate that prior exercise is an effective means to attenuate KA-induced seizures and comorbid behavioral changes in a model of hypertension and epilepsy suggesting a potential influence of hippocampal 5-HT on a comorbid depression. However, this beneficial impact does not prevent the development of epilepsy and concomitant brain damage.",

Amygdala kindling has been used as an experimental model to study epileptogenesis. Although amygdala kindling has been extensively investigated in the context of its clinical relevance to the epilepsies, potential associated respiratory alterations are not well known. Here, our main objective was to better investigate the mechanisms involved in respiratory physiology impairment in the amygdala rapid kindling (ARK) model of epileptogenesis. Male Wistar rats with electrodes implanted into the amygdaloid complex were used. After recovery from surgery, the rats were subjected to electrical stimulation of basolateral amygdala for 2 consecutive days (10 stimuli/day). The ventilatory parameters were evaluated by whole body plethysmography. Thereafter, animals were also exposed to hypercapnia (7\% CO2) for 3 h to evaluate fos protein expression in several nuclei involved in respiratory control. We observed a significant reduction in ventilation during the ictal phase elicited by ARK. We also found that 10 days after ARK, baseline ventilation as well as the hypercapnia ventilatory response (7\% CO2) were reduced compared to control rats. The number of fos-immunoreactive neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus, raphe magnus and nucleus of the solitary tract were also reduced after ARK. Our results showed that ARK was able to impair breathing function, demonstrating a strong coupling between amygdala and the respiratory neurons in the brainstem, with potential impact in respiratory failures, frequently fatal, during or after epileptic seizures in chronic animal models and in patients.",

Typically refractive to conventional therapy, serotonin neurotransmission may be an innovative target for treatment. To further understand the role of serotonin in this disorder, in this study we examined the state of the endogenous serotonin system in an Scn1a+/-mouse model of DS. Examined at an age before seizures appear, we found the hypothermic effect of 5-HT1A receptor agonist administration was attenuated. HPLC analysis of brain monoamine content revealed modestly reduced serotonin levels in tissue samples of the midbrain that included the dorsal raphe nucleus but no changes elsewhere in the brain. The reduced sensitivity to 5-HT1A agonist administration seen at young ages reversed after the age of seizure development when mice showed an exaggerated hypothermic response. Likewise, adult DS mice showed a pronounced hypersensitivity to a 5-HT2A/2C agonist. As adults however monoamine levels were not detectably altered. Thus there are alterations in the endogenous serotonin system that both precede and follow the appearance of seizure in DS mice, most strikingly in the response to agonist administration.",

abstract = "Adolescents and adults may respond differently to antidepressants, with poorer efficacy and greater probability of adverse effects in adolescents. The mechanisms underlying this differential response are largely unknown, but likely relate to an interaction between the neural effects of antidepressants and brain development. We used Fos immunohistochemistry to examine regional differences in adolescent (postnatal day (PND) 28) and young adult (PND 56) male, Wistar rats given a single injection of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (10mg/kg). Paroxetine induced widespread Fos expression in both adolescent and young adult rats. Commonly affected areas include the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dorsolateral), medial preoptic area, paraventricular hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei and central nucleus of the amygdala. Fos expression was generally lower in adolescents with significantly greater Fos expression observed in young adults in the prelimbic cortex, supraoptic nucleus, basolateral amygdala, lateral parabrachial and K{\"o}lliker-Fuse nuclei. However, a small subset of regions showed greater adolescent Fos expression including the nucleus accumbens shell, lateral habenula and dorsal raphe. Paroxetine increased plasma corticosterone concentrations in young adults, but not adolescents. Plasma paroxetine levels were not significantly different between the age groups. These results indicate a different c-Fos signature of acute paroxetine in adolescent rats, with greater activation in key mesolimbic and serotonergic regions, but a more subdued cortical, brainstem and hypothalamic response. This suggests that the atypical response of adolescents to paroxetine may be related to a blunted neuroendocrine response, combined with insufficient top-down regulation of limbic regions involved in reward and impulsivity.",

abstract = "One of the possible causes of death in epilepsy is breathing disorders, especially apneas, which lead to an increase in CO2 levels (hypercapnia) and/or a decrease in O2 levels in arterial blood (hypoxemia).

Recent data from our group demonstrated respiratory changes in two experimental models of epilepsy, i.e. audiogenic epilepsy, and amygdala rapid kindling. Here, we aimed to evaluate respiratory changes in the classic model of temporal lobe epilepsy induced by intra-hippocampal injection of pilocarpine. Adult Wistar rats with stainless-steel cannulas implanted in the hippocampus region were used. The animals were submitted to pilocarpine injection (2.4 mg/$\mu$L, N = 12-15) or saline (N = 9) into the hippocampus. The respiratory parameters analyzed by whole-body plethysmography were respiratory rate (fR), tidal volume (VT) and ventilation (VE). Respiratory mechanics such as Newtonian airway resistance (Rn), viscance of the pulmonary parenchyma (G) and the elastance of the pulmonary parenchyma (H) were also investigated. No changes in baseline breathing were detected 15 or 30 days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). However, 30 days after pilocarpine-induced SE, a significant reduction in VE was observed during hypercapnic (7\% CO2) stimulation, without affecting the hypoxia (8\% O2) ventilatory response. We also did not observe changes in respiratory mechanics. The present results suggest that the impairment of the hypercapnia ventilatory response in pilocarpine-induced SE could be related to a presumable degeneration of brainstem respiratory neurons but not to peripheral mechanisms.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Electrical high frequency stimulation (HFS) has been shown to suppress seizures. However, the mechanisms of seizure suppression remain unclear and techniques for blocking specific neuronal populations are required. OBJECTIVE: The goal is to study the optical HFS protocol on seizures as well as the underlying mechanisms relevant to the HFS-mediated seizure suppression by using optogenetic methodology. METHODS: Thy1-ChR2 transgenic mice were used in both vivo and in vitro experiments. Optical stimulation with pulse trains at 20 and 50 Hz was applied on the focus to determine its effects on in vivo seizure activity induced by 4-AP and recorded in the bilateral and ipsilateral-temporal hippocampal CA3 regions. In vitro methodology was then used to study the mechanisms of the in vivo suppression. RESULTS: Optical HFS was able to generate 82.4\% seizure suppression at 50 Hz with light power of 6.1 mW and 80.2\% seizure suppression at 20 Hz with light power of 2.0 mW. The suppression percentage increased by increasing the light power and saturated when the power reached above-mentioned values. In vitro experimental results indicate that seizure suppression was mediated by activation of GABA receptors. Seizure suppression effect decreased with continued application but the suppression effect could be restored by intermittent stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that optical stimulation at high frequency targeting an excitatory opsin has potential therapeutic application for fast control of an epileptic focus. Furthermore, electrophysiological observations of extracellular and intracellular signals revealed that GABAergic neurotransmission activated by optical stimulation was responsible for the suppression.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity in epilepsy patients. The lack of success with current pharmacological interventions for this patient population, highlights the importance of optimizing non-pharmacological neuromodulatory treatments such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Studies on the antidepressant effect of VNS in epilepsy patients may be confounded by concurrent anti-epileptic drug therapy. To date, studies in epilepsy models overcoming this problem are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether VNS affects anhedonia, a key symptom of major depression, in the kainic acid rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: Anhedonia was assessed in kainic acid (KA) and saline (SAL) injected rats using the saccharin preference test (SPT). To exclude differences in taste perception, the quinine aversion test (QAT) was performed. Both groups were randomly subdivided in a VNS and a SHAM group, yielding 4 experimental arms: KA-VNS, KA-SHAM, SAL-VNS and SAL-SHAM. Both VNS groups received 2 weeks of VNS, while the SHAM groups were not stimulated. Thereafter, the SPT and QAT were repeated. RESULTS: Saccharin preference was significantly reduced in the KA compared to the SAL rats (P < 0.05), without differences in quinine aversion. Two weeks of VNS significantly increased the saccharin preference in the KA-VNS group (P < 0.05), while it had no effect on quinine aversion. No effects of VNS or SHAM were found in the other groups. CONCLUSION: The KA rats displayed anhedonia which was significantly decreased by VNS, indicating that this neuromodulatory treatment could likewise diminish depressive symptoms in patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy and comorbid depression.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Tract-tracing studies in cats and rats demonstrated that the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) projects to the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS); it has remained unclear as to whether or not the ABVN projects to the NTS in humans. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether non-invasive electrical stimulation of the cymba conchae, a region of the external ear exclusively innervated by the ABVN, activates the NTS and the ``classical'' central vagal projections in humans. METHODS: Twelve healthy adults underwent two fMRI scans in the same session. Electrical stimulation (continuous 0.25ms pulses, 25Hz) was applied to the earlobe (control, scan \#1) and left cymba conchae (scan \#2). Statistical analyses were performed with FSL. Two region-of-interest analyses were performed to test the effects of cymba conchae stimulation (compared to baseline and control, earlobe, stimulation) on the central vagal projections (corrected; brainstem P < 0.01, forebrain P < 0.05), followed by a whole-brain analysis (corrected, P < 0.05). RESULTS: Cymba conchae stimulation, compared to earlobe (control) stimulation, produced significant activation of the ``classical'' central vagal projections, e.g., widespread activity in the ipsilateral NTS, bilateral spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, and contralateral parabrachial area, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. Bilateral activation of the paracentral lobule was also observed. Deactivations were observed bilaterally in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence in humans that the central projections of the ABVN are consistent with the ``classical'' central vagal projections and can be accessed non-invasively via the external ear.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Brainstem-focused mechanisms supporting transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) effects are not well understood, particularly in humans. We employed ultrahigh field (7T) fMRI and evaluated the influence of respiratory phase for optimal targeting, applying our respiratory-gated auricular vagal afferent nerve stimulation (RAVANS) technique. HYPOTHESIS: We proposed that targeting of nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and cardiovagal modulation in response to taVNS stimuli would be enhanced when stimulation is delivered during a more receptive state, i.e. exhalation. METHODS: Brainstem fMRI response to auricular taVNS (cymba conchae) was assessed for stimulation delivered during exhalation (eRAVANS) or inhalation (iRAVANS), while exhalation-gated stimulation over the greater auricular nerve (GANctrl, i.e. earlobe) was included as control. Furthermore, we evaluated cardiovagal response to stimulation by calculating instantaneous HF-HRV from cardiac data recorded during fMRI. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that eRAVANS evoked fMRI signal increase in ipsilateral pontomedullary junction in a cluster including purported NTS. Brainstem response to GANctrl localized a partially-overlapping cluster, more ventrolateral, consistent with spinal trigeminal nucleus. A region-of-interest analysis also found eRAVANS activation in monoaminergic source nuclei including locus coeruleus (LC, noradrenergic) and both dorsal and median raphe (serotonergic) nuclei. Response to eRAVANS was significantly greater than iRAVANS for all nuclei, and greater than GANctrl in LC and raphe nuclei. Furthermore, eRAVANS, but not iRAVANS, enhanced cardiovagal modulation, confirming enhanced eRAVANS response on both central and peripheral neurophysiological levels. CONCLUSION: 7T fMRI localized brainstem response to taVNS, linked such response with autonomic outflow, and demonstrated that taVNS applied during exhalation enhanced NTS targeting.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Humans routinely shift their sleepiness and wakefulness levels in response to emotional factors. The diversity of emotional factors that modulates sleep-wake levels suggests that the ascending arousal network may be intimately linked with networks that mediate mood. Indeed, while animal studies have identified select limbic structures that play a role in sleep-wake regulation, the breadth of corticolimbic structures that directly modulates arousal in humans remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether select regional activation of the corticolimbic network through direct electrical stimulation can modulate sleep-wake levels in humans, as measured by subjective experience and behavior. METHODS: We performed intensive inpatient stimulation mapping in two human participants with treatment resistant depression, who underwent intracranial implantation with multi-site, bilateral depth electrodes. Stimulation responses of sleep-wake levels were measured by subjective surveys (i.e. Stanford Sleepiness Scale and visual-analog scale of energy) and a behavioral arousal score. Biomarker analyses of sleep-wake levels were performed by assessing spectral power features of resting-state electrophysiology. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated three regions whereby direct stimulation modulated arousal, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), subgenual cingulate (SGC), and, most robustly, ventral capsule (VC). Modulation of sleep-wake levels was frequency-specific: 100Hz OFC, SGC, and VC stimulation promoted wakefulness, whereas 1Hz OFC stimulation increased sleepiness. Sleep-wake levels were correlated with gamma activity across broad brain regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence for the overlapping circuitry between arousal and mood regulation in humans. Furthermore, our findings open the door to new treatment targets and the consideration of therapeutic neurostimulation for sleep-wake disorders.",

The present study explores the pathophysiological implications of KARs in generating recurrent seizures in chronic epilepsy. In an in vitro model of TLE, seizure-like activity was minimized in mice lacking the GluK2 subunit, which is a main component of aberrant synaptic KARs at rMF synapses. In vivo, the frequency of interictal spikes and ictal discharges was strongly reduced in GluK2(-/-) mice or in the presence of a GluK2/GluK5 receptor antagonist.

We show that selectively inhibiting MCs during severe seizures reduced manifestations of those seizures, hippocampal injury, and chronic epilepsy. In contrast, selectively activating MCs was pro-convulsant. Mechanistic in vitro studies using optogenetics further demonstrated the unanticipated ability of MC axons to excite GCs under pathological conditions.

Furthermore, optogenetic activation of these neurons increases pupillary size and anxiety-like behaviors but does not induce approach, avoidance, or locomotion. These findings suggest that excitatory responses in PnocBNST neurons encode rapid arousal responses that modulate anxiety states.

We demonstrate that brain mTORC1 signaling is reduced after acute fasting of mice and that neuronal mTORC1 integrates GATOR1 complex-mediated amino acid and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-mediated growth factor signaling. Neuronal mTORC1 is most sensitive to withdrawal of leucine, arginine, and glutamine, which are dependent on DEPDC5, a component of the GATOR1 complex. Metabolomic analysis reveals that Depdc5 neuronal-specific knockout mice are resistant to sensing significant fluctuations in brain amino acid levels after fasting. Depdc5 neuronal-specific knockout mice are resistant to the protective effects of fasting on seizures or seizure-induced death. These results establish that acute fasting reduces seizure susceptibility in a DEPDC5-dependent manner. Modulation of nutrients upstream of GATOR1 and mTORC1 could offer a rational therapeutic strategy for epilepsy treatment.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder in the US, affecting over 2.2 million people. Epilepsy is associated with a number of medical and psychiatric comorbidities, higher health care utilization, cost and substantial economic burden. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is 2-fold more common in adults with epilepsy than age-matched controls and the incidence increases with age. Self-reported daytime sleepiness is not helpful in predicting OSA, possibly related to the ceiling effect of general sleepiness among people with epilepsy from diverse causes. Mostly small retrospective series found a significant reduction in seizures in people with epilepsy and OSA adherent with positive airway pressure therapy compared to untreated individuals. This finding illustrates the potential beneficial effects of sleep therapies on epilepsy. Central apnea, oxygen desaturations and hypercapnia can occur during the ictal and immediate postictal period, especially with generalized tonic clonic seizures. Central apneas have been produced by electrical stimulation of mesial temporal structures. These respiratory disturbances suggest activation of the central autonomic network and may contribute to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), the leading cause of epilepsy-related death in people with drug-resistant epilepsy. SUDEP typically occurs during sleep and patients are more often found in a prone position and have a history of nocturnal seizures. Whether OSA contributes to SUDEP is unknown. Vagal nerve stimulation is a form of neuromodulation for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. When the device activates during sleep it causes reduction in airflow and respiratory effort, airflow obstruction and oxygen desaturations, sometimes producing a clinical sleep apnea syndrome. The goal of this review is to discuss firmly established and recently recognized clinical, neurobiological, electrophysiological and polysomnographic relationships between sleep disordered breathing and epilepsy.",

abstract = "Epilepsy has been known for thousands of years and has been subjected to various forms of conventional and non-conventional therapies including a non-pharmacological conservative treatment known as aromatherapy, ever since. One commonly practiced form of aromatherapy that persists as an immediate first-aid measure even today in some parts of developing countries in the East is the application of ``shoe-smell'' during an epileptic attack. The questionable remedial role has intrigued neuro-scientists at least in these parts of the world. This brief paper attempts to provide an insight to the basis of persistence of this practice and to explore a possible scientific logic behind its unscientifically reported remedial effectiveness. The neurophysiology of olfactory stimulation from ``shoe-smell'' reveals a sound and scientific reasoning for its remedial efficacy in epilepsy; olfactory stimuli in this study have been found to possess significantly effective anti-epileptic influence which could have formed the basis for the use of application of ``shoe-smell'' in earlier times and also for its persistence even today in those parts of developing regions.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of consecutive patients who had GCSs in the epilepsy monitoring units of two epilepsy centers. Statistical analysis was performed to assess specific variables as potential risk factors for PGES. RESULTS: Among the 208 enrolled patients with 366 seizures, PGES was observed in 109 (51.9\%) patients and 168 (45.9\%) GCSs. The mean duration of PGES was 33.2 $\pm$ 12.0 s (34 s, 3-70 s). PGES or severe PGES (>20 s) was associated with more severe postictal coma and temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, PGES was independently associated with a longer tonic duration, shorter total seizure duration, and lower habitual seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS: PGES is strongly correlated not only with longer tonic duration, but also with shorter total seizure duration and lower habitual seizure frequency. SIGNIFICANCE: PGES may represent a switch-off inhibitory mechanism in seizure termination; moreover, it may indicate the efficacy of a long-lasting inhibitory network that suppresses GCS ictogenesis.",

abstract = "Introduction Among the reflex seizures, those triggered by smell are very rarely reported. We aimed to present a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), who experienced a video-EEG recorded seizure while smelling ylang-ylang extract during a study protocol. Patient and methods The patient is a 34-year-old woman with drug-resistant TLE, which had started when she was 9years old. Her MRI revealed left mesial temporal lobe sclerosis. She had 1--5 focal seizures impairing awareness per month. Stress and sadness were the only reported seizure triggers. During her routine pre-surgical evaluation, a standardized video-EEG study protocol was also applied after taking her consent. Baseline, hyperventilation, intermittent photic stimulation and olfactory stimulations (OS) were performed with a published standard protocol. One ml of odorant solution of ylan-ylang extract was dropped on a cotton ball, and was applied to the middle of both nostrils during 3min. This activation was repeated twice and followed by 15min of resting records (post-OS1 and post-OS2). We investigated modulation of epileptiform discharges by OS by counting the interictal spikes. However, a focal seizure has occurred in the first minute of smelling. After 5months, video-EEG with the same protocol was repeated and increase in spike counts during post-OS periods was documented. Moreover, she was found to have hypo-osmia with Sniffin Sticks test, despite she had no complaints. Conclusion Our results suggested that olfactory stimulation may trigger reflex seizures and increase interictal spikes in some patients with TLE.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Describe changes in clinical seizure frequency and electrophysiological data recorded in patients with medically-intractable seizures and periventricular nodular heterotopias (PVNH) treated with the RNS\textregistered{} System (NeuroPace, Inc., Mountain View, CA). METHODS: Clinical seizures from eight patients (mean follow-up of 10.1 years) were analyzed pre- and post-treatment. Chronic ambulatory electrocorticograms (ECoGs) recorded from PVNHs, hippocampus and neocortex were evaluated to identify the earliest electrographic seizure onset type, pattern of spread, and interictal characteristics. RESULTS: Mean reduction in disabling seizures was 85.7 \% (n = 8); seven patients had >50\% seizure reduction and two were seizure-free in the final year of analysis. Seizure rate showed a progressive reduction over the course of the study with the highest rate of improvement in the first two to three years after implantation. Four of seven patients with one PVNH lead and a second lead in the hippocampus or neocortex had some electrographic seizures first recorded at either lead location, suggesting two foci or seizure propagation patterns. Low voltage fast type activity was the prominent seizure onset pattern. Interictal ECoG power was lower in PVNH than hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: RNS\textregistered{} System treatment substantially reduced clinical seizure frequency in patients with PVNH. Analysis of ictal ECoG records suggests PVNH may be involved in seizure generation. SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic ECoG recordings suggest PVNH tissue can actively participate in epileptogenic networks. Direct brain-responsive neurostimulation is a safe and effective treatment option in such patients, progressively reducing seizure rate over a period of years.",

We present a retrospective cohort study of cEEG monitoring in COVID-19 patients to better explore this knowledge gap. Methods Among 22 COVID-19 patients, 19 underwent cEEGs, and 3 underwent routine EEGs (<1 hour). Demographic and clinical variables, including comorbid conditions, discharge disposition, survival and cEEG findings, were collected. Results cEEG was performed for evaluation of altered mental status (n=17) or seizure-like events (n=5). Five patients, including 2 with epilepsy, had epileptiform abnormalities on cEEG. Two patients had electrographic seizures without a prior epilepsy history. There were no acute neuroimaging findings. Periodic discharges were noted in one-third of patients and encephalopathic EEG findings were not associated with IV anesthetic use. Conclusions Interictal epileptiform abnormalities in the absence of prior epilepsy history were rare. However, the discovery of asymptomatic seizures in two of twenty-two patients was higher than previously reported and is therefore of concern. Significance cEEG monitoring in COVID-19 patients may aid in better understanding an epileptogenic potential of SARS-CoV2 infection.

The Working Group of the International League Against Epilepsy and the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology developed the CPG according to the methodology proposed by the ILAE Epilepsy Guidelines Working Group. We reviewed the published evidence using The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement and evaluated the evidence and formulated the recommendations following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. We found high level of evidence for the accuracy of automated detection of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS) and recommend use of wearable automated seizure detection devices for selected patients when accurate detection of GTCS and FBTCS is recommended as a clinical adjunct. We also found moderate level of evidence for seizure types without GTCs or FBTCs. However, it was uncertain whether the detected alarms resulted in meaningful clinical outcomes for the patients. We recommend using clinically validated devices for automated detection of GTCS and FBTCS, especially in unsupervised patients, where alarms can result in rapid intervention (weak/conditional recommendation). At present, we do not recommend clinical use of the currently available devices for other seizure types (weak/conditional recommendation). Further research and development are needed to improve the performance of automated seizure detection and to document their accuracy and clinical utility.",

We compared PES on simultaneous intracranial and scalp-EEG and evaluated the association of PES with postictal heart rate variability (HRV) and SUDEP outcome. Methods Convulsive seizureswere analyzed in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy at 5 centers. Intracranial PES was quantified using the Hilbert transform. HRV was quantified using root mean square of successive differences of interbeat intervals, low-frequency to high-frequency power ratio, and RR-intervals. Results There were 64 seizures from 63 patients without SUDEP and 11 seizures from 6 SUDEP patients. PES occurred in 99\% and 87\% of seizures on intracranial-EEG and scalp-EEG, respectively. Mean PES duration in intracranial and scalp-EEG was similar. Intracranial PES was regional (<90\% of channels) in 46\% of seizures; scalp PES was generalized in all seizures. Generalized PES showed greater decrease in postictal parasympathetic activity than regional PES. PES duration and extent were similar between patients with and without SUDEP. Conclusions Regional intracranial PES can be present despite scalp-EEG demonstrating generalized or no PES. Postictal autonomic dysfunction correlates with the extent of PES.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Amygdala has been demonstrated as one of the brain sites involved in the control of cardiorespiratory functioning. The structural and physiological alterations induced by epileptic activity are also present in the amygdala and reflect functional changes that may be directly associated with a sudden unexpected death. Seizures are always associated with neuronal damage and changes in the expression of cation-chloride cotransporters and Na/K pumps. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate if these changes are present in the amygdala after induction of status epilepticus with pilocarpine, which may be directly correlated with Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). METHODS: Pilocarpine-treated wistar rats 60 days after Status Epilepticus (SE) were compared with control rats. Amygdala nuclei of brain slices immunostained for NKCC1, KCC2 and $\alpha$1-Na+/K+-ATPase, were quantified by optical densitometry. RESULTS: The amygdaloid complex of the animals submitted to SE had no significant difference in the NKCC1 immunoreactivity, but KCC2 immunoreactivity reduced drastically in the peri-somatic sites and in the dendritic-like processes. The $\alpha$1-Na+/K+-ATPase peri-somatic immunoreactivity was intense in the rats submitted to pilocarpine SE when compared with control rats. The pilocarpine SE also promoted intense GFAP staining, specifically in the basolateral and baso-medial nuclei with astrogliosis and cellular debris deposition. INTERPRETATION: The findings revealed that SE induces lesion changes in the expression of KCC2 and $\alpha$1-Na+/K+-ATPase meaning intense change in the chloride regulation in the amygdaloid complex. These changes may contribute to cardiorespiratory dysfunction leading to SUDEP.",

Of the known ionotropic glutamate receptors, kainate receptors are ubiquitous in the central nervous system, and a considerable amount of data indicates that this class of receptors is present at both sides of the synapse. Pre- and postsynaptic kainate receptors are able to regulate both transmission of information and excitability in a synapse-specific manner. Proteins interacting with kainate receptor subunits are being identified and functional studies have provided evidence of the existence of a dual signalling system. It has become clear that these receptors have a role in synaptic plasticity and that they might also have a fundamental role in epilepsy through the strategic control of network excitability.

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is an important relay for multiple cortical and subcortical regions involved in processing anxiety as well as neuroendocrine and autonomic responses to stress, and it is thought to play a role in the dysregulation of these functions as well as in addictive behavior. While its architecture and connection profile have been thoroughly examined in animals, studies in humans have been limited to post-mortem histological descriptions of the BNST itself, not accounting for the distribution of its various connections. In the current study, we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to investigate the courses of fiber tracks connected to the BNST in humans. We restricted our seed region for probabilistic fiber tracking to the dorsal part of the BNST, as the ventral BNST is not distinguishable from the surrounding grey matter structures using magnetic resonance imaging. Our results show two distinct pathways of the BNST to the amygdala via the stria terminalis and the ansa peduncularis, as well as connections to the hypothalamus. Finally, we distinguished a route to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) running through the head of the caudate nucleus (CN) and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Pathways to brainstem regions were found to show a considerable inter-individual variability and thus no common pathway could be identified across participants. In summary, our findings reveal a complex network of brain structures involved in behavioral and neuroendocrine regulation, with the BNST in a central position.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The human insula is increasingly being implicated as a multimodal functional network hub involved in a large variety of complex functions. Due to its inconspicuous location and highly vascular anatomy, it has historically been difficult to study. Cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs), utilize low frequency stimulation to map cerebral networks. They were used to study connections of the human insula. METHODS: CCEP data was acquired from each sub-region of the dominant and non-dominant insula in 30 patients who underwent stereo-EEG. Connectivity strength to the various cortical regions was obtained via a measure of root mean square (RMS), calculated from each gyrus of the insula and ranked into weighted means. RESULTS: The results of all cumulative CCEP responses for each individual gyrus were represented by circro plots. Forty-nine individual CCEP pairs were stimulated across all the gyri from the right and left insula. In brief, the left insula contributed more greatly to language areas. Sensory function, pain, saliency processing and vestibular function were more heavily implicated from the right insula. Connections to the primary auditory cortex arose from both insula regions. Both posterior insula regions showed significant contralateral connectivity. Ipsilateral mesial temporal connections were seen from both insula regions. In visual function, we further report the novel finding of a direct connection between the right posterior insula and left visual cortex. SIGNIFICANCE: The insula is a major multi-modal network hub with the cerebral cortex having major roles in language, sensation, auditory, visual, limbic and vestibular functions as well as saliency processing. In temporal lobe epilepsy surgery failure, the insula may be implicated as an extra temporal cause, due to the strong mesial temporal connectivity findings.",

We identify several dynorphinergic inputs to the VTA and demonstrate that projections from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) both contribute to anxiety-like behavior but differentially affect threat generalization.

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) represents the most severe degree of the spectrum of epilepsy severity and is the commonest cause of epilepsy-related premature mortality. The precise pathophysiology and the genetic architecture of SUDEP remain elusive. Aiming to elucidate the genetic basis of SUDEP, we analysed rare, protein-changing variants from whole-exome sequences of 18 people who died of SUDEP, 87 living people with epilepsy and 1479 non-epilepsy disease controls. Association analysis revealed a significantly increased genome-wide polygenic burden per individual in the SUDEP cohort when compared to epilepsy (P = 5.7 $\times$ 10(- 3)) and non-epilepsy disease controls (P = 1.2 $\times$ 10(- 3)). The polygenic burden was driven both by the number of variants per individual, and over-representation of variants likely to be deleterious in the SUDEP cohort. As determined by this study, more than a thousand genes contribute to the observed polygenic burden within the framework of this study. Subsequent gene-based association analysis revealed five possible candidate genes significantly associated with SUDEP or epilepsy, but no one single gene emerges as common to the SUDEP cases. Our findings provide further evidence for a genetic susceptibility to SUDEP, and suggest an extensive polygenic contribution to SUDEP causation. Thus, an overall increased burden of deleterious variants in a highly polygenic background might be important in rendering a given individual more susceptible to SUDEP. Our findings suggest that exome sequencing in people with epilepsy might eventually contribute to generating SUDEP risk estimates, promoting stratified medicine in epilepsy, with the eventual aim of reducing an individual patient's risk of SUDEP.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Thirty-percent of patients with epilepsy are drug-resistant, and might benefit from effective noninvasive therapeutic interventions. Evidence is accumulating on the efficacy of autonomic biofeedback therapy using galvanic skin response (GSR; an index of sympathetic arousal) in treating epileptic seizures. This study aimed to extend previous controlled clinical trials of autonomic biofeedback therapy with a larger homogeneous sample of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. In addition, we used neuroimaging to characterize neural mechanisms of change in seizure frequency following the therapy. METHODS: Forty patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (age: 18 to 70years old), on stable doses of anti-epileptic medication, were recruited into a controlled and parallel-group trial from three screening centers in the UK. Patients were allocated to either an active intervention group, who received therapy with GSR biofeedback, or a control group, who received treatment as usual. Allocation to the group was informed, in part, by whether patients could travel to attend repeated therapy sessions (non-randomized). Measurement of outcomes was undertaken by an assessor blinded to the patients' group membership. Resting-state functional and structural MRI data were acquired before and after one month of therapy in the therapy group, and before and after a one-month interval in the control group. The percentage change of seizure frequency was the primary outcome measure. The analysis employed an intention-to-treat principle. The secondary outcome was the change in default mode network (DMN) and limbic network functional connectivity tested for effects of therapy. The trial was registered with the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) portfolio (ID 15967). FINDINGS: Data were acquired between May 2014 and October 2016. Twenty participants were assigned to each group. Two patients in the control group dropped out before the second scan, leaving 18 control participants. There was a significant difference in reduction of seizure frequency between the therapy and control groups (p50\%. Neuroimaging analysis revealed that post-therapy seizure reduction was linearly correlated with enhanced functional connectivity between right amygdala and both the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and frontal pole (FP). INTERPRETATION: Our clinical study provides evidence for autonomic biofeedback therapy as an effective and potent behavioral intervention for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. This approach is non-pharmacological, non-invasive and seemingly side-effect free.",

abstract = "Introduction: Mortality in persons living with epilepsy (PwE) is 1.6-9.3-fold higher than in the general population. Mortality from definite/probable Sudden Unexpected Death in EPilepsy (SUDEP) is estimated at 1.2 per 1000 person-years. We report mortality and SUDEP rate in a cohort of Rwandan PwE. Methods: PwE presenting for a first visit at the Ndera epilepsy center between January and June 2016 were followed-up prospectively. For PwE who did not attend their follow-up visit, home visits were organized. Deaths were assessed using World Health Organization Verbal Autopsy Standards age-specific questionnaires. Results: Of 235 PwE enrolled, home visits were organized for 81 (34.4\%) PwE who did not return for their follow-up consultation. Seven fatalities (mortality 16.7/1000 patient-years [CI 6.7-34.3]) were recorded (aged 2-80 years). Four had an identified cause. Three were classified as probable SUDEP, resulting in a probable SUDEP rate of 7.1/1000 patient-years (CI 1.47-20.86). Probable SUDEP occurred in PwE (age: 2, 21, 34 years) showing no symptoms of illness while receiving antiepileptic treatment; in two cases, death occurred during sleep. Conclusion: Although autopsies were absent, the high mortality and probable SUDEP rates warrant future studies to establish causes of epilepsy-related deaths in Rwanda and sub-Saharan Africa.",

author = "Sharma, Ayushe A and Szaflarski, Jerzy P",
abstract = "The neurobiological underpinnings of functional seizure (FS) development and maintenance represent an active research area. Recent work has focused on hardware (brain structure) and software (brain function and connectivity). However, understanding whether FS are an adaptive consequence of changes in brain structure, function, and/or connectivity is important for identifying a causative mechanism and for FS treatment and prevention. Further, investigation must alsouncover what causes these structural and functional phenomena. Pioneering work in the field of psychoneuroimmunology has established a strong, consistent link between psychopathology, immune dysfunction, and brain structure/function. Based on this and recent FS biomarker findings, we propose a new etiologic model of FS pathophysiology. We hypothesize that early-life stressors cause neuroinflammatory and neuroendocrine changes that prime the brain for later FS development following secondary trauma (e.g., traumatic brain injury or psychological trauma). This framework coalesces existing knowledge regarding brain aberrations underlying FS and established neurobiological theories on the pathophysiology of underlying psychiatric disorders. We also propose brain temperature mapping as a way of indirectly visualizing neuroinflammation in patients with FS, particularly in emotion regulation, fear processing, and sensory-motor integration circuits. We offer a foundation on which future research can be built, with clear recommendations for future studies.",

A neurology consultant uncovered a years-long history of frequent episodic staring followed by confusion and expressive aphasia, which strongly suggested that she suffered from epilepsy. Thus, her cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation met criteria for a near-sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) diagnosis. Serial bloodwork demonstrated transient troponin I elevations and leukocytoses, while a brain MRI revealed global cerebral anoxic injury and a small acute right cerebellar ischemic infarction. A review of her medical record uncovered a hospitalization sixteen months earlier for a likely GTCS whose workup showed similar troponin I elevations and leukocytoses, and surprisingly, a different small acute right cerebellar ischemic infarction in the same vascular territory. To our knowledge, this is the first report of subcortical ischemic infarctions occurring concurrently with GTCSs in a near-SUDEP patient. Aside from illustrating the key role of inpatient neurologists in the diagnosis of near-SUDEP, this manuscript discusses the potential significance of postictal ischemic infarctions, transient asymptomatic troponin elevations, and transient non-infectious leukocytoses in epilepsy patients with cardiovascular risk factors.",

We report a PTEN-mutated child showing macrocephaly, mild intellectual disability and epilepsy symptomatic of right occipital polymicrogyria, who also developed Chiari I Malformation (CIM) that repeatedly required surgical correction. We suppose that the association between PHTS and CIM could be not coincidental, thus extending the spectrum of neurological manifestations of PHTS and highlighting the role of brain MRI in the management of PHTS patients.

abstract = "The purpose of our study was to determine the cardio-respiratory pattern exerted by the systemic injection of neurotensin, contribution of neurotensin NTS(1) receptors and the neural pathways mediating the responses. The effects of an intravenous injection (i.v.) of neurotensin were investigated in anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats in following experimental schemes: (i) control animals before and after midcervical vagotomy; (ii) in three separate subgroups of rats: neurally intact, vagotomized at supranodosal level and initially midcervically vagotomized exposed to section of the carotid sinus nerves (CSNs); (iii) in the intact rats 2 minutes after blockade of neurotensin NTS(1) receptors with SR 142948. Intravenous injection of 10 $\mu$g/kg of neurotensin in the intact rats evoked prompt increase in the respiratory rate followed by a prolonged slowing down coupled with augmented tidal volume. Midcervical vagotomy precluded the effects of neurotensin on the frequency of breathing, while CSNs section reduced the increase in tidal volume. In all the neural states neurotensin caused significant fall in mean arterial blood pressure preceded by prompt hypertensive response. The cardio-respiratory effects of neurotensin were blocked by pre-treatment with NTS(1) receptor antagonist. The results of this study showed that neurotensin acting through NTS(1) receptors augments the tidal component of the breathing pattern in a large portion via carotid body afferentation whereas the respiratory timing response to neurotensin depends entirely on the intact midcervical vagi. Blood pressure effects evoked by an intravenous neurotensin occur outside vagal and CSNs pathways and might result from activation of the peripheral vascular NTS(1) receptors.",

Our objective was to evaluate influence of the hybrid composed of endomorphin-2 and neurotensin fragments on ventilation, heart rate and blood pressure in anesthetized and awake rats. METHODS: The effects of PK20 (1mg/kg) were studied either after its intravenous administration in anesthetized rats or intraperitoneal injection in awake state. Tidal volume and the timing components of the breathing pattern, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded. RESULTS: Intravenous administration of PK20 in the neurally intact rats evoked a dose-dependent apnoea followed by a transient insignificant increase in tidal volume and breathing rate. The blood pressure changes were biphasic: transient increase was replaced by prolonged hypotension. Midcervical vagotomy abrogated all post-PK20 respiratory effects. Hypotension was eliminated after blockade of neurotensin NTS1 receptor, while respiratory changes were reduced by blockade of both: NTS1 and $\mu$ opioid receptors. After PK20 intraperitoneal injection awake rats did not show any significant changes in ventilation and blood pressure. CONCLUSION: This chimeric peptide should be used with care via intravenous administration in anesthetized animals since PK20 may evoke respiratory apnoea and hypotension.

abstract = "Drug resistant epilepsy affects ∼30\% of people with epilepsy and is associated with epilepsy syndromes with frequent and multiple types of seizures, lesions or cytoarchitectural abnormalities, increased risk of mortality and comorbidities such as cognitive impairment and sleep disorders. A limitation of current preclinical models is that spontaneous seizures with comorbidities take time to induce and test, thus making them low-throughput. Kcna1-null mice exhibit all the characteristics of drug resistant epilepsy with spontaneous seizures and comorbidities occurring naturally; thus, we aimed to determine whether they also demonstrate pharmacoresistanct seizures and the impact of medications on their sleep disorder comorbidity. In this exploratory study, Kcna1-null mice were treated with one of four conventional antiseizure medications, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenytoin, and phenobarbital using a moderate throughput protocol (vehicle for 2 days followed by 2 days of treatment with high therapeutic doses selected based on published data in the 6 Hz model of pharmacoresistant seizures). Spontaneous recurrent seizures and vigilance states were recorded with video-EEG/EMG. Carbamazepine, levetiracetam and phenytoin had partial efficacy (67\%, 75\% and 33\% were seizure free, respectively), whereas phenobarbital was fully efficacious and conferred seizure freedom to all mice. Thus, seizures of Kcna1-null mice appear to be resistant to three of the drugs tested. Levetiracetam failed to affect sleep architecture, carbamazepine and phenytoin had moderate effects, and phenobarbital, as predicted, restored sleep architecture. Data suggest Kcna1-null mice may be a moderate throughput model of drug resistant epilepsy useful in determining mechanisms of pharmacoresistance and testing novel therapeutic strategies.",

abstract = "Sudden unexplained/unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), with an incidence of 0.35-9.3/1000 patient-years depending on the severity of epilepsy, remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Potential pathomechanisms comprise cardiac arrhythmia, due to myocardial ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, arrhythmogenic drugs, or transmission of the epileptic activity via the autonomic nervous system to the heart, and central or obstructive apnea. In most studies on SUDEP, data are lacking about the family and patient's own clinical history, cardiovascular symptoms, concomitant diseases and prior findings. Whether arterial hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, other neurologic disorders, lung diseases, smoking or electrolyte disturbances are risk factors for SUDEP is unknown. Whereas cardiac dysfunction during seizures has been documented by electrocardiography, and cardiac abnormalities are found in up to 33\% of SUDEP cases autoptically, investigations between seizures found only little cardiac abnormalities. More knowledge about the cardiovascular and pulmonary status of epileptic patients during, immediately after and between seizures is needed, which may contribute to better understand and possibly prevent SUDEP by measures like ``cardioprotective'' drugs, respiratory therapy or implantation of a cardioverter/defibrillator.",

The genetic locus responsible for the AGS phenotype in the Frings mouse has been named monogenic audiogenic seizure-susceptible (MASS1). MASS1 is unique in that it is one of only two identified seizure loci that are not associated with an ion channel mutation. Furthermore, Frings mice display a robust AGS phenotype demonstrating very high and prolonged susceptibility to sound-induced tonic extension seizures. The purpose of this investigation was to use c-Fos immunohistochemistry to map the brain structures involved in the Frings AGS and to examine neuronal hyperexcitability in the inferior colliculus, the brain structure that is recognized as the site of AGS initiation. AGS mapping revealed that intense seizure-induced neuronal activation was mostly limited to structures involved in a brainstem seizure network, including the external and dorsal nuclei of the inferior colliculus, as observed in other AGS rodents. Acoustically induced c-Fos expression in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus to sub-AGS threshold tone stimulations displayed a greater level of neuronal activation in AGS-susceptible Frings, DBA/2J and noise-primed C57BL/6J mice compared to AGS-resistant C57BL/6J and CF1 mice.

abstract = "Most patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of epilepsy, show pronounced loss of neurons in limbic brain regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal regions. Hippocampal damage in patients with TLE is characterized by extensive neuronal loss in the CA3 and CA1 sectors and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. There is a long and ongoing debate on whether this type of hippocampal damage, referred to as hippocampal sclerosis, is the cause or consequence of TLE. Furthermore, hippocampal damage may contribute to the progressive features of TLE. The present study was designed to determine whether development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) after extended kindling of the amygdala in rats is associated with neuronal damage. The kindling model of TLE was chosen because previous studies have shown that only part of the rats develop SRS after extended kindling, thus allowing to compare the brain pathology of rats that received the same number of amygdala stimulation but did or did not develop SRS. For extended kindling, rats were stimulated twice daily 3--5 days a week for up to about 280 stimulations. During long-term EEG/video monitoring, SRS were observed in 50\% of the rats over the period of extended kindling. SRS often started with myoclonic jerks or focal seizures and subsequently progressed into secondarily generalized seizures, so that the development of SRS recapitulated the earlier kindling of elicited seizures. No obvious neurodegeneration was observed in the CA1 and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus, the amygdala, parahippocampal regions or thalamus. A significant bilateral reduction in neuronal density was determined in the dentate hilus after extended kindling, but this reduction in hilar cell density did not significantly differ between rats with and without observed SRS. Determination of the total number of hilar neurons and of hilar volume indicated that the reduced neuronal density in the dentate hilus was due to expansion of hilar area but not to neuronal damage. The data demonstrate that extended kindling does not cause any hippocampal damage resembling hippocampal sclerosis, but that SRS develop in the absence of such damage.",

abstract = "Emerging evidence indicates that early maternal care permanently modifies the activity of hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal (HPA) axis and is a critical factor in determining the capacity of the brain to compensate for later encountered insults. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of corticosterone (CORT) in the detrimental effects of neonatal isolation (NI) on seizures. Rats were assigned randomly to the following five groups: (1) control (CONT) rats; (2) NI rats that underwent daily separation from their dams from postnatal day 2 (P2) to P9; (3) status epilepticus (SE) rats, induced by lithium-pilocarpine (Li-Pilo) model at P10; (4) NI plus SE (NIS) rats and (5) NISM rats, a subset of NIS rats receiving metyrapone (100 mg/kg), a CORT synthesis inhibitor, immediately after SE induction. At P10, plasma CORT levels were compared at baseline in CONT and NI rats and in response to Li-Pilo-induced SE among SE, NIS and NISM rats. We evaluated the spatial memory in the Morris water maze at P50∼55, the expression of hippocampal cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation at serine-133 (pCREBSer-133) at P55, hippocampal neuronal damage at P80 and seizure threshold at P100. The isolated rats exhibited higher CORT release in response to SE than non-isolated rats, and the NIS rats had greater cognitive deficits and decreased seizure threshold compared to the CONT, NI and SE groups. By contrast, the NISM group, compared to the NIS group, showed a normal CORT response to SE and better spatial memory but no difference in seizure threshold. Compared to the CONT group, the hippocampal pCREBSer-133 level was significantly reduced in all experimental groups (NI, SE, NIS, NISM) with no differences between groups. All rats were free of spontaneous seizures later in life and had no discernible neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Results in this model demonstrate repetitive NI enhances response of plasma CORT to SE, and exacerbates the neurological consequences of neonatal SE. Amelioration of neurological sequelae following reduction of the SE-induced excessive rise in plasma CORT implicates CORT in the pathogenesis of NI increasing the vulnerability to seizures.",

TPM (10, 30 or 60 mg/kg) was injected at the onset of SE and 10h later and DZP (2.5 and 1.25mg/kg) at 2 and 10h after SE. TPM treatment was continued twice daily for 6 days. Other rats received two injections of DZP on the day of SE. Cell counting was performed on thionine-stained sections 14 days after SE and after 2 months of epilepsy. Occurrence and frequency of SRS were video-recorded. The MRI T2-weighted signal was quantified in hippocampus and ventral cortices. DZP-TPM treatment induced partial neuroprotection in CA1 and hilus, and tended to increase the percentage of rats with protected neurons in layer III/IV of the ventral entorhinal cortex. The latency to and frequency of SRS were not modified by DZP-TPM. T2-weighted signal was decreased in hippocampus 3 days after SE at all TPM doses and in ventral hippocampus after epilepsy onset.

title = "Synaptic reorganization in subiculum and {CA3} after early-life status epilepticus in the kainic acid rat model",
author = "Cross, Devin J and Cavazos, Jos{\'e} E",
abstract = "PURPOSE: The immature rat brain is highly susceptible to seizures, but has a resistance to pathological changes induced by seizures as compared to adult rats. However, prolonged seizures during early-life enhance cellular injury and hyperexcitability induced by convulsive insults later in adulthood. The mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not understood. In adult models, the CA1 axons reorganize their projections to subiculum. Seizure induced plasticity in this pathway has not been investigated in immature seizure models, and may contribute to the vulnerability to later seizures. METHODS: On postnatal day 15, rats experienced convulsive status epilepticus with kainic acid (KA). Seizure induced plasticity was examined with Timm histochemistry and iontophoretic injections of sodium selenite, a retrograde tracer. Cellular injury was evaluated with Fluoro-Jade B histochemistry. RESULTS: Retrograde tracing experiments determined a 67\% larger dorsoventral extent of retrograde labeling in the CA1 pyramidal region after tracer injections in subiculum. The synaptic reorganization of the CA1 projection to subiculum was noted in the absence of overt neuronal injury in subiculum or CA1. In contrast, mossy fiber sprouting was detected into the stratum oriens of CA3 with limited neuronal injury to CA3 pyramidal neurons. No mossy fiber sprouting into the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, or CA1 sprouting into the stratum moleculare of CA1 were noted. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the developing brain has distinct mechanisms of seizure induced reorganization as compared to the adult brain. Our experiments show that the concept of ``resistance of the immature brain to excitotoxicity'' is considerably more complicated than generally believed. Morphological plasticity in the immature brain appears more extensive in distal, but not proximal, projections of hippocampal pathways, and across hippocampal lamellae. The abnormal connectivity between hippocampal lamellae might play a role in the increased susceptibility to injury and hyperexcitability associated with later convulsive insults.",

author = "Aroniadou-Anderjaska, Vassiliki and Fritsch, Brita and Qashu, Felicia and Braga, Maria F M",
abstract = "Summary Acute brain insults, such as traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, or stroke are common etiologies for the development of epilepsy, including temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is often refractory to drug therapy. The mechanisms by which a brain injury can lead to epilepsy are poorly understood. It is well recognized that excessive glutamatergic activity plays a major role in the initial pathological and pathophysiological damage. This initial damage is followed by a latent period, during which there is no seizure activity, yet a number of pathophysiological and structural alterations are taking place in key brain regions, that culminate in the expression of epilepsy. The process by which affected/injured neurons that have survived the acute insult, along with well-preserved neurons are progressively forming hyperexcitable, epileptic neuronal networks has been termed epileptogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms of epileptogenesis is crucial for the development of therapeutic interventions that will prevent the manifestation of epilepsy after a brain injury, or reduce its severity. The amygdala, a temporal lobe structure that is most well known for its central role in emotional behavior, also plays a key role in epileptogenesis and epilepsy. In this article, we review the current knowledge on the pathology of the amygdala associated with epileptogenesis and/or epilepsy in TLE patients, and in animal models of TLE. In addition, because a derangement in the balance between glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission is a salient feature of hyperexcitable, epileptic neuronal circuits, we also review the information available on the role of the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems in epileptogenesis and epilepsy in the amygdala.",

Blinded comparisons of 13 historical information items (HII) and 19 video-recorded semiologic features (VSF) were made. We identified 3 HII (sex, history of febrile convulsions, and history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and 2 VSF (fencing posturing and postictal confusion) that significantly distinguished between FLS and TLS. The multivariate analysis model correctly identified 87\% of FLS patients and 74\% of TLS patients. No single HII or VSF is sufficient for distinguishing between FLS and TLS. A model integrating multiple HII and VSF may assist in this differentiation, but some patients still may be misclassified.",

title = "Brain stimulation for surgical epilepsy",
author = "Jobst, Barbara",
abstract = "Summary Direct brain stimulation is an emerging treatment of epilepsy especially in patients that are not candidates for epilepsy surgery. Several different approaches of brain stimulation in epilepsy have been developed: stimulation is applied to interrupt epileptic networks in subcortical structures or a stimulus is directly applied to the seizure onset zone. Scheduled stimulation targets mainly subcortical structures like the anterior thalamic nucleus or the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus was studied in a randomized trial in humans. Several case series reported reduction of seizures targeting other subcortical structures. Scheduled stimulation of the seizure onset zone in the hippocampus has also been shown to be safe and effective in a small number of patients. The application of electrical pulses to test for certain brain functions has long been established for the purposes of brain mapping. Traditionally stimulation at 50Hz for several seconds has been used. This stimulus frequently causes afterdischarges or seizures. Afterdischarges can be terminated by applying a very brief stimulus at the same frequency. Responsive stimulation is based on detection on this principle. Seizures are recorded intracranially and a high-frequency pulse applied whenever seizures evolve electrically. An automated implanted device for seizures detection and stimulation has been developed and shown to be safe for human use. A large clinical trial is currently ongoing. In conclusion, the optimal target and mode of stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy remains under investigation and requires large and costly controlled trials.",

abstract = "Endocannabinoid system and its CB1 receptors are suggested to provide endogeneous protection against seizures. The present study examines whether CB1 receptors contribute to resistance to seizures and kindling epileptogenesis in a model of audiogenic epilepsy. Three groups of Wistar rats were used: rats unsusceptible to audiogenic seizures, rats with acquired resistance to audiogenic seizures and rats with reproducible audiogenic running seizures. Chronic treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 (5 daily dosing of 30 mg/kg) did not change innate resistance to audiogenic seizures in non-epileptic rats but reverted acquired seizure resistance in rats which lost their epileptic sensitivity with repeated testing. In the latter rats, audiogenic running seizures reappeared for at least two weeks after the end of treatment. In rats with reproducible seizure response, acutely, SR lengthened audiogenic seizures due to prolongation or appearance, de novo, of post-running limbic clonus without any effect on running seizure per se. This limbic component mimicked audiogenic kindling and indicated propagation of sound-induced brainstem seizure to the limbic forebrain. After chronic SR administration the incidence of the limbic clonus remained to be increased for at least two weeks. The present study supports the hypothesis about a role of CB1 receptors in endogeneous anticonvulsive mechanisms of the brain.",

abstract = "Rat hippocampal area CA3 pyramidal cells synchronously discharge in rhythmic bursts of action potentials after acute disinhibition or convulsant treatment in vitro. These burst discharges resemble epileptiform activity, and are of interest because they may shed light on mechanisms underlying limbic seizures. However, few studies have examined CA3 burst discharges in an animal model of epilepsy, because a period of prolonged, severe seizures (status epilepticus) is often used to induce the epileptic state, which can lead to extensive neuronal loss in CA3. Therefore, the severity of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus was decreased with anticonvulsant treatment to reduce damage. Rhythmic burst discharges were recorded in the majority of slices from these animals, between two weeks and nine months after status epilepticus. The incidence and amplitude of bursts progressively increased with time after status, even after spontaneous behavioral seizures had begun. The results suggest that modifying the pilocarpine models of temporal lobe epilepsy to reduce neuronal loss leads to robust network synchronization in area CA3. The finding that these bursts increase long after spontaneous behavioral seizures begin supports previous arguments that temporal lobe epilepsy exhibits progressive pathophysiology.",

author = "Zhang, Z J and Valiante, T A and Carlen, P L",
abstract = "Summary One of the most terrifying aspects of epilepsy is the sudden and apparently unpredictable transition of the brain into the pathological state of an epileptic seizure. The pathophysiology of the transition to seizure still remains mysterious. Herein we review some of the key concepts and relevant literatures dealing with this enigmatic transitioning of brain states. At the ``MACRO'' level, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings at time display preictal phenomena followed by pathological high-frequency oscillations at the seizure onset. Numerous seizure prediction algorithms predicated on identifying changes prior to seizure onset have met with little success, underscoring our lack of understanding of the dynamics of transition to seizure, amongst other inherent limitation. We then discuss the concept of synchronized hyperexcited oscillatory networks underlying seizure generation. We consider these networks as weakly coupled oscillators, a concept which forms the basis of some relevant mathematical modeling of seizure transitions. Next, the underlying ``MICRO'' processes involved in seizure generation are discussed. The depolarization of the GABAA chloride reversal potential is a major concept, facilitating epileptogenesis, particularly in immature brain. Also the balance of inhibitory and excitatory local neuronal networks plays an important role in the process of transitioning to seizure. Gap junctional communication, including that which occurs between glia, as well as ephaptic interactions are increasingly recognized as critical for seizure generation. In brief, this review examines the evidence regarding the characterization of the transition to seizure at both the ``MACRO'' and ``MICRO'' levels, trying to characterize this mysterious yet critical problem of the brain state transitioning into a seizure.",

Methodology This prospective study included 70 patients with HWE (M:F = 55:15; age: 25.3 $\pm$ 8.4 years). Details of demography, seizure characteristics and outcome, and imaging/EEG observations were recorded. Result There was male dominance. Majority of the patients belonged to Mandya: 30.5\%, Ramanagara: 30.0\% and Mysore: 15.2\% districts of Karnataka, India. Forty-five patients (M:F = 37:8; age: 24.6 $\pm$ 10.1 years) had features of `HWE alone'. Twenty-five (M:F = 18:7; age: 26.7 $\pm$ 7.9 years) had HWE with spontaneous seizures. The age at onset of seizures was comparable in both the groups -- HWE: 18.7 $\pm$ 10.2 years vs. HWE with spontaneous seizure: 16.8 $\pm$ 10.3 years (p = 0.34). The duration of seizures were more in HWE with spontaneous seizure group: 119.5 $\pm$ 66.9 months compared to HWE alone: 69.9 $\pm$ 13.8 months (p = 0.028). Inter-ictal EEG (n = 70) showed epileptiform activities in 15 patients (21.4\%).

author = "Sobayo, Tiwalade and Mogul, David J",
abstract = "The development of an epileptic ``mirror'' focus in an area of the brain contralateral to the primary epileptic focus typically evolves over days in the experimental setting after status epilepticus or electrical kindling of the primary focal region. In contrast, we observed the rapid development of an apparent mirror focus in the contralateral hippocampus following microinjection of kainic acid (KA) in the ipsilateral hippocampus in rats. Using multisite intracranial recordings, local field potentials were recorded in anesthetized adult male rats using electrodes implanted in the CA3 region of both hippocampi and in the anteromedial nucleus of the thalamus. Epileptogenesis was induced by microinjection of KA in the ipsilateral CA3 region. Development of seizures was followed under three experimental perturbations to the contralateral hippocampus: (A) no treatment, (B) pre-treatment with microinjection of the AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonist CNQX, and (C) pre-treatment with microinjection of the selective kainate receptor antagonist UBP 301. Both control and UBP 301 groups had seizures preferentially originate in the contralateral hippocampus appearing within ten minutes of KA injection. In contrast, the CNQX group had seizures preferentially originate in the ipsilateral hippocampus. By tracking the order of seizure onset, the probability that a hippocampal seizure would propagate across commissural fibers prior to any thalamic seizure activity was significantly reduced in the CNQX group compared to control and UBP groups suggesting that the AMPA receptor mediated component responsible for mirror focus development was also necessary for the spread of ictal activity via the commissural fibers. Understanding how a complex circuit in the brain develops may be critical to uncovering ways of either disrupting its development or treating its effects. The rapid appearance of a contralateral mirror focus via AMPA receptors in a limbic epilepsy model might be the mechanism by which a putative long-term mirror focus is established in vivo and may also underlie how secondary generalization progresses in some cases.",

Cortical lamination abnormalities together with vascular lesions are subsumed as FCD IIIc. Little is known regarding frequency and etiology of this entity. Here, we systematically evaluated biopsy specimens from 72 drug-refractory epilepsy patients with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) regarding presence of associated FCD. Due to a non-perpendicular orientation of the cortical structures or absence of sufficient cortical tissue adjacent to the vascular lesion 25 samples were not classifiable. In the remaining 47 cases FCD IIIc was rare (4.3\%), but significantly increased in patients with multiple CCM (28.6\%; p<0.05 vs. single CCM). Association of FCD IIIc with multiple CCM may argue against FCD IIIc as an acquired lesion.",

author = "O'Toole, Kate K and Hooper, Andrew and Wakefield, Seth and Maguire, Jamie",
abstract = "Summary Stress is the most commonly reported precipitating factor for seizures. The proconvulsant actions of stress hormones are thought to mediate the effects of stress on seizure susceptibility. Interestingly, epileptic patients have increased basal levels of stress hormones, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and corticosterone, which are further increased following seizures. Given the proconvulsant actions of stress hormones, we proposed that seizure-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may contribute to future seizure susceptibility. Consistent with this hypothesis, our data demonstrate that pharmacological induction of seizures in mice with kainic acid or pilocarpine increases circulating levels of the stress hormone, corticosterone, and exogenous corticosterone administration is sufficient to increase seizure susceptibility. However, the mechanism(s) whereby seizures activate the HPA axis remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that seizure-induced activation of the HPA axis involves compromised GABAergic control of CRH neurons, which govern HPA axis function. Following seizure activity, there is a collapse of the chloride gradient due to changes in NKCC1 and KCC2 expression, resulting in reduced amplitude of sIPSPs and even depolarizing effects of GABA on CRH neurons. Seizure-induced activation of the HPA axis results in future seizure susceptibility which can be blocked by treatment with an NKCC1 inhibitor, bumetanide, or blocking the CRH signaling with Antalarmin. These data suggest that compromised GABAergic control of CRH neurons following an initial seizure event may cause hyperexcitability of the HPA axis and increase future seizure susceptibility.",

author = "MacKenzie, Georgina and Maguire, Jamie",
abstract = "Summary The most commonly reported precipitating factor for seizures is stress. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby stress triggers seizures are not yet fully understood. Here we demonstrate a potential mechanism underlying changes in neuronal excitability in the hippocampus following chronic stress, involving a shift in the reversal potential for GABA (EGABA) associated with a dephosphorylation of the potassium chloride co-transporter, KCC2. Mice subjected to chronic restraint stress (30 min/day for 14 consecutive days) exhibit an increase in serum corticosterone levels which is associated with increased susceptibility to seizures induced with kainic acid (20 mg/kg). Following chronic stress, but not acute stress, we observe a dephosphorylation of KCC2 residue S940, which regulates KCC2 cell surface expression and function, in the hippocampus. To determine the impact of alterations in KCC2 expression following chronic stress, we performed gramicidin perforated patch recordings to measure changes in EGABA and neuronal excitability of principal hippocampal neurons. We observe a depolarizing shift in EGABA in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons after chronic stress. In addition, there is an increase in the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, evident by a shift in the input-output curve which could be reversed with the NKCC1 inhibitor, bumetanide. These data uncover a potential mechanism involving chronic stress-induced plasticity in chloride homeostasis which may contribute to stress-induced seizure susceptibility.",

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Reflex seizures are epileptic events triggered by specific motor, sensory or cognitive stimulation. This comprehensive narrative review focuses on the role of genetic determinants in humans and animal models of reflex seizures and epilepsies. METHODS: References were mainly identified through MEDLINE searches until August 2015 and backtracking of references in pertinent studies. RESULTS: Autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance was proven in several families with photosensitivity. Molecular genetic studies on EEG photoparoxysmal response identified putative loci on chromosomes 6, 7, 13 and 16 that seem to correlate with peculiar seizure phenotype. No specific mutation has been found in Papio papio baboon, although a genetic etiology is likely. Mutation in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A was found in another animal model of photosensitivity (Fayoumi chickens). Autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance overlapping with a genetic background for IGE was proposed for some families with primary reading epilepsy. Musicogenic seizures usually occur in patients with focal symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsies, but they have been reported in rare genetic epilepsies such as Dravet syndrome. A single LGI1 mutation has been described in a girl with seizures evoked by auditory stimuli. Interestingly, heterozygous knockout (Lgi1(+/-)) mice show susceptibility to sound-triggered seizures. Moreover, in Frings and Black Swiss mice, the spontaneous mutations of MASS1 and JAMS1 genes, respectively, have been linked to audiogenic seizures. Eating seizures usually occur in symptomatic epilepsies but evidences for a genetic susceptibility were mainly provided by family report from Sri Lanka. Eating seizures were also reported in rare patients with MECP2 duplication or mutation. Hot water seizures are genetically heterogeneous but two loci at chromosomes 4 and 10 were identified in families with likely autosomal dominant inheritance. Startle-induced seizures usually occur in patients with symptomatic epilepsies but have also been reported in the setting chromosomal disorders or genetically inherited lysosomal storage diseases. DISCUSSION: The genetic background of reflex seizures and epilepsies is heterogeneous and mostly unknown with no major gene identified in humans. The benefits offered by next-generation sequencing technologies should be merged with increasing information on animal models that represent an useful tool to study the mechanism underlying epileptogenesis. Finally, we expect that genetic studies will lead to a better understanding of the multiple factors involved in the pathophysiology of reflex seizures, and eventually to develop preventive strategies focused on seizure control and therapy optimization.",

The frequency of SUDEP correlates with the severity of epilepsies and lack of response to antiepileptic drug treatment, but the underlying mechanisms of SUDEP have not been elucidated fully. GABRG2(Q390X) is a mutation associated with the epileptic encephalopathy Dravet syndrome (DS) and with genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) in patients. The Gabrg2(+/Q390X) knockin (KI) mouse phenocopies the major features of DS and GEFS+ and has SUDEP throughout life. The Gabrg2(+/-) knockout (KO) mouse is associated with infrequent absence seizures and represents a model of mild absence epilepsy syndrome without increased mortality. To explore the basis for SUDEP in DS and GEFS+, we compared mutant $\gamma$2 subunit and wild-type $\alpha$1 and $\beta$2/3 subunit expression in mice in brainstem nuclei associated with respiratory function including the solitary tract, pre-Botzinger complex and Kolliker-Fuse nuclei. We found that synaptic GABAA receptors were reduced while intracellular nonfunctional $\gamma$2(Q390X) subunits were increased in the heterozygous DS and GEFS+ KI mice, but not in the heterozygous absence epilepsy KO mice. Given the critical role of these nuclei in cardiorespiratory function, it is likely the impaired GABAergic transmission and neuronal dysfunction in these brainstem nuclei are involved in the cardiorespiratory collapse in SUDEP. The study provides novel mechanistic insights into cardiorespiratory failure of SUDEP.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is rare but is an important public health burden due to the number of patient years lost. Respiratory dysfunction following generalized convulsive seizure is a common sequence of events in witnessed SUDEP cases. The DBA/2 mouse model of SUDEP exhibits generalized convulsive audiogenic seizures (AGSz), which result in seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) in ∼75\% of these animals, while the remaining DBA/2 mice exhibit AGSz without S-IRA. SUDEP induction may involve actions of adenosine, which is released during generalized seizures in animals and patients and is known to depress respiration. This study examined the effects of systemic administration of agents that alter the actions of adenosine on the incidence of S-IRA in DBA/2 mice. DBA/2 mice that consistently exhibited AGSz without S-IRA showed a significantly increased incidence of S-IRA following treatment with 5-iodotubercidin, which blocks adenosine metabolism. Treatment of DBA/2 mice that consistently exhibited AGSz followed by S-IRA with a non-selective adenosine antagonist, caffeine, or an A2A adenosine receptor subtype-selective antagonist (SCH 442416) significantly reduced S-IRA incidence. By contrast, an A1 adenosine receptor antagonist (DPCPX) was not effective in reducing S-IRA incidence. These findings suggest that preventative approaches for SUDEP should consider agents that reduce the actions of adenosine.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: The peri-ictal autonomic disturbances have been studied as predictors of seizure outcome and as markers of seizure onset. We studied the changes in heart rate (HR), HRV, oxygen saturation and blood pressure (BP) in the peri-ictal period in patients with drug-resistant localization-related epilepsy. METHODOLOGY: Ninety one subjects undergoing video-EEG monitoring, underwent continuous HR, SpO2, BP and Lead II ECG monitoring. The changes during the preictal, ictal and postictal periods were analyzed for 57 seizures in 42 patients with artifact-free recordings and correlated with VEEG ictal onset and MRI characteristics. RESULTS: Ictal tachycardia was noted in 15 (26.3\%) seizures, of which, 60\% had temporal lobe onset. HR increased by an average of 20.1\% from pre-ictal to ictal phases (p=0.04). Ictal bradycardia was noted in one event with right temporal seizure onset. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis of the preictal, ictal and postictal phases showed an increase in the sympathetic and decrease in parasympathetic activity during the ictus with relatively preserved total power. Ictal oxygen desaturation (84.1\%$\pm$3.5\%) was noticed in 10 (17.5\%) seizures. Ictal hypertension was observed in 15 (26.3\%); ictal hypotension was noted in 5 (8.7\%) seizures. Both the systolic BP and diastolic BPs increased from the pre-ictal to ictal phase (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Peri-ictal dysautonomia can present in variable patterns and can be measured and compared over different modalities such as BP, HR and HRV. Though degree of tachycardia and increase in BP were higher during extratemporal onset of seizures, a fall in variability was noted in seizures of temporal lobe origin. Oxygen desaturation is not an uncommon event during the peri-ictal period in localization related epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Determine the extent and time course of volumetric changes in the contralateral hippocampus following surgery for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). METHODS: Serial T1-weighted MRI brain scans were obtained in 26 TLE patients pre- and post-temporal lobe epilepsy surgery as well as in 12 control subjects of similar age. Patients underwent either anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) or selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH). Blinded, manual hippocampal volumetry (head, body, and tail) was performed in two groups: 1) two scan group [ATL (n=6); SAH (n=10)], imaged pre-surgery and on average at 5.4 years post-surgery; and 2) longitudinal group [ATL (n=8); SAH (n=2)] imaged pre-surgery and on post-operative day 1, 2, 3, 6, 60, 120 and a delayed time point (average 2.4 years). RESULTS: In the two scan group, there was atrophy by 12\% of the unresected contralateral hippocampus (p<0.001), with atrophy being most pronounced (27\%) in the hippocampal body (p<0.001) with no significant differences seen for the hippocampal head or tail. In the longitudinal group, significant atrophy was also observed for the whole hippocampus and the body with atrophy seen as early as post-operative day \#1 which progressed significantly over the first post-operative week (1.3\%/day and 3.0\%./day, respectively) before stabilizing over the long-term to a 13\% reduction in total volume. There was no significant difference in atrophy compared by surgical approach (ATL vs. SAH; p=0.94) or side (p=0.31); however, atrophy was significantly more pronounced in patients with ongoing post-operative seizures (hippocampal body, p=0.019; whole hippocampus, p=0.048). There were no detectable post-operative neuropsychological deficits attributable to contralateral hippocampal atrophy. SIGNIFICANCE: Significant contralateral hippocampal atrophy occurs following TLE surgery, which begins immediately and progresses over the first post-operative week. The observation that seizure free patients had significantly less atrophy of the contralateral hippocampus after surgery suggests the possibility of an early post-operative imaging marker to predict surgical outcome.",

abstract = "Seizure spread into the autonomic nervous system can result in life-threatening cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction. Here we report on a less-studied consequence of such autonomic derangements-the possibility of laryngospasm and upper-airway occlusion. We used parenteral kainic acid to induce recurring seizures in urethane-anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats. EEG recordings and combinations of cardiopulmonary monitoring, including video laryngoscopy, were performed during multi-unit recordings of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) activity or head-out plethysmography with or without endotracheal intubation. Controlled occlusions of a tracheal tube were used to study the kinetics of cardiac and respiratory changes after sudden obstruction. Seizure activity caused significant firing increases in the RLN that were associated with abnormal, high-frequency movements of the vocal folds. Partial airway obstruction from laryngospasm was evident in plethysmograms and was prevented by intubation. Complete glottic closure (confirmed by laryngoscopy) occurred in a subset of non-intubated animals in association with the largest increases in RLN activity, and cessation of airflow was followed in all obstructed animals within tens of seconds by ST-segment elevation, bradycardia, and death. Periods of central apnea occurred in both intubated and non-intubated rats during seizures for periods up to 33s and were associated with modestly increased RLN activity, minimal cardiac derangements, and an open airway on laryngoscopy. In controlled complete airway occlusions, respiratory effort to inspire progressively increased, then ceased, usually in less than 1min. Respiratory arrest was associated with left ventricular dilatation and eventual asystole, an elevation of systemic blood pressure, and complete glottic closure. Severe laryngospasm contributed to the seizure- and hypoxemia-induced conditions that resulted in sudden death in our rat model, and we suggest that this mechanism could contribute to sudden death in epilepsy.",

abstract = "Alterations in cardiac electrophysiology are an established consequence of long-standing drug resistant epilepsy. Patients with chronic epilepsy display abnormalities in both sinoatrial node pacemaker current as well as ventricular repolarizing current that places them at a greater risk of developing life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The development of cardiac arrhythmias secondary to drug resistant epilepsy is believed to be a key mechanism underlying the phenomenon of Sudden Unexpected Death in EPilepsy (SUDEP). Though an increasing amount of studies examining both animal models and human patients have provided evidence that chronic epilepsy can detrimentally affect cardiac function, the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. Recent work has shown the expression of several key cardiac ion channels to be altered in animal models of genetic and acquired epilepsies. This has led to the currently held paradigm that cardiac ion channel expression may be secondarily altered as a consequence of seizure activity-resulting in electrophysiological cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, cortical autonomic dysfunction - resulting from seizure activity-has also been suggested to play a role, whereby seizure activity may indirectly influence cardiac function via altering centrally-mediated autonomic output to the heart. In this review, we discuss various cardiac dysrhythmias associated with seizure events-including tachycardia, bradycardia and QT prolongation, both ictally and inter-ictally, as well as the role of the autonomic nervous system. We further discuss key ion channels expressed in both the heart and the brain that have been shown to be altered in epilepsy and may be responsible for the development of cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to chronic epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: High-frequency oscillations (80-500Hz; HFOs) have been shown to be a specific biomarker of the seizure-onset zone. The relationship of HFOs with seizures having different intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) morphological onsets, however, has shown significant relationships in experimental animals but has not been studied in humans. We investigated how interictal and ictal HFOs relate to different seizure-onset morphological patterns. METHODS: We analyzed the most representative seizure type of 37 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent iEEG for diagnostic evaluation. According to the morphology, 211 seizure-onset zone channels were classified in six patterns (low-voltage fast activity; sharp activity at $\leq$13Hz; low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spikes; burst of high-amplitude polyspikes; spike-and-wave activity; and delta brush). Interictal and ictal HFOs were compared between the six seizure-onset patterns. RESULTS: Interictal ripple and fast ripple rates differed significantly across seizure-onset patterns (p<0.001). Significant differences were also found for ictal HFOs density across the different seizure-onset patterns (p<0.001). Sharp activity at $\leq$13Hz was associated with the lowest interictal HFO rate suggesting either that the mechanism that generates this type of EEG morphology do not generate HFOs or possibly that this pattern is more likely to be generated in a region of seizure spread. Regarding the difference in HFO density between pre-ictal baseline and seizure-onset section across the six patterns, burst of high-amplitude polyspikes and delta brushes had the highest densities of both ripples and fast ripples (p<0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated that distinct seizure-onset patterns correlate specific interictal and ictal HFO profiles confirming that seizures with different morphological patterns likely have different mechanisms of generation. This study emphazises that, in clinical practice, seizure-onset patterns should be distinguished and specified when analyzing HFOs, particularly if they are used in presurgical evaluation to better localize the seizure-onset zone.",

The 'real-world' clinical utility of NGS remains to be determined in focal epilepsies, which account for 60\% of all epilepsies and for which the importance of genetic factors is just beginning to emerge. We investigated the diagnostic yield and management implications of whole exome sequencing (WES)-based screening of selected genes in the routine care of common focal epilepsies suspected to have a genetic basis. METHODS: We performed WES, followed by targeted analysis of 64 epilepsy genes, on 40 consecutive children and adults enrolled prospectively from routine clinical practice who had MRI-negative focal epilepsy and a family history of febrile seizures or any type of epilepsy in at least one first- or second-degree relative. Exclusion criteria were previous genetic testing, severe intellectual disability and benign focal epilepsies of childhood. RESULTS: 5/40 (12.5\%) patients had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, detected in SCN1A, DEPDC5, PCDH19, GABRG2 or NPRL2. Identifying a pathogenic SCN1A variant in a patient with drug-resistant epilepsy prompted to halt presurgical investigations due to concern of unfavorable post-surgical outcome. It also led in the same patient to discontinue long-standing carbamazepine therapy (a potentially aggravating drug in epilepsies due to SCN1A mutations), resulting in complete seizure control. Patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants had a younger median age of seizure onset (range) compared to those without [18 months (8 months-18 years) vs 18 years (18 months-70 years), p=0.02]. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate that WES with targeted gene analysis is an effective diagnostic tool for patients with common focal epilepsies in whom a genetic etiology is suspected. It can also influence clinical decision-making, including antiepileptic drug selection and consideration of epilepsy surgery, hence supporting its incorporation in the routine clinical care of this patient group.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of epilepsy and drug-resistant epilepsy in pediatric patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To determine clinical and imaging differences between those with drug-resistant epilepsy, drug-responsive epilepsy, and no epilepsy among children with MRI-identified FCD. METHODS: A keyword search of a hospital radiology database identified 97 study participants for inclusion in this retrospective study. Participants were included if they were under 18 years of age at time of database query and had an MRI between 2004 and 2013 showing FCD. Exclusion was based on imaging and clinical characteristics. Data was gathered using a chart review and supplemental questionnaire. RESULTS: In this cohort of patients with imaging findings compatible with FCD, 29\% had not developed epilepsy. The prevalence of epilepsy and drug-resistant epilepsy was 71.13\% (95\% C.I.=61.05-79.89\%) and 32.99\% (95\% C.I.=23.78-43.27\%), respectively. Patients with epilepsy were more likely to have temporal (p=0.029) or frontal (p=0.044) lobe lesions and a family history of seizures (p=0.003) than those without epilepsy. Age of seizure onset was later in those with drug-responsive epilepsy than those with drug-resistant epilepsy (p=0.0002). A later age of seizure onset (OR=1.22, p=0.0441, 95\% C.I.=1.00-1.486) and absence of developmental delay (OR=3.624, p=0.0497, 95\% C.I.=1.002-13.110) predicted a less severe epilepsy phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have only assessed patient cohorts with FCD and epilepsy, limiting the data on ``asymptomatic'' or ``atypically presenting'' FCD. Identifying a surprisingly large, novel cohort of children with FCD that had not developed epilepsy helps define prognosis and inform clinical management of children with FCD on imaging.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major concern for patients with epilepsy. In most witnessed cases of SUDEP generalized seizures and respiratory failure preceded death, and pre-mortem neuroimaging studies in SUDEP patients observed changes in specific subcortical structures. Our study examined the role of subcortical structures in the DBA/1 mouse model of SUDEP using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). These mice exhibit acoustically-evoked generalized seizures leading to seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) that results in sudden death unless resuscitation is rapidly instituted. MEMRI data in the DBA/1 mouse brain immediately after acoustically-induced S-IRA were compared to data in C57 (control) mice that were exposed to the same acoustic stimulus that did not trigger seizures. The animals were anesthetized and decapitated immediately after seizure in DBA/1 mice and after an equivalent time in control mice. Comparative T1 weighted MEMRI images were evaluated using a 14T MRI scanner and quantified. We observed significant increases in activity in DBA/1 mice as compared to controls at previously-implicated auditory (superior olivary complex) and sensorimotor-limbic [periaqueductal gray (PAG) and amygdala] networks and also in structures in the respiratory network. The activity at certain raphe nuclei was also increased, suggesting activation of serotonergic mechanisms. These data are consistent with previous findings that enhancing the action of serotonin prevents S-IRA in this SUDEP model. Increased activity in the PAG and the respiratory and raphe nuclei suggest that compensatory mechanisms for apnea may have been activated by S-IRA, but they were not sufficient to prevent death. The present findings indicate that changes induced by S-IRA in specific subcortical structures in DBA/1 mice are consistent with human SUDEP findings. Understanding the changes in brain activity during seizure-induced death in animals may lead to improved approaches directed at prevention of human SUDEP.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained the brain specimens from 33 patients with GNTs, including 22 gangliogliomas (GGs) and 11 dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs). The expression of two autophagy-related proteins (LC3B and Beclin-1) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and BRAF V600E mutation was examined by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Among 33 epileptic patients with GNTs, the frequency of high expression of LC3B was 36.4\% (12/33), and that of Beclin-1 was 39.4\% (13/33). High expression of LC3B and Beclin-1 proteins was significantly associated with BRAF V600E mutation in GNTs (P=0.008; P=0.018), and LC3B overexpression was also correlated with temporal location of GNTs (P=0.002). In GGs alone, high expression of LC3B revealed significant correlation with BRAF V600E mutation and temporal location (P=0.020; P=0.015), while Beclin-1 showed no correlation with them (P>0.05). Furthermore, autophagy-related proteins did not show any association with other studied clinicopathological features, such as gender, age at seizure onset, epilepsy duration and postoperative seizure outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations demonstrated that impaired autophagy may be associated with BRAF V600E mutation. However, large sample studies with long-term follow-up were required.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a significant public health burden. The mechanisms of SUDEP are elusive, although cardiorespiratory dysfunction is a likely contributor. Clinical and animal studies indicate that seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) is the primary event leading to death in many SUDEP cases. Our prior studies demonstrated that intraperitoneal (IP) injection of atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) widely used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, suppresses S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. In the current study, we injected atomoxetine intracerebroventricularly (ICV) and measured its effect on S-IRA in DBA/1 mice to determine its central effects. Additionally, to test our hypothesis that atomoxetine reduces S-IRA via altering cardiorespiratory function, we examined the effect of atomoxetine on respiratory and cardiac function using non-invasive plethysmography and ECG in anesthetized DBA/1 mice, and on blood pressure and heart rate using a tail-cuff system in conscious DBA/1 mice. ICV administration of atomoxetine at 200-250nmol significantly reduced S-IRA evoked by acoustic stimulation in DBA/1 mice, consistent with a central atomoxetine effect on S-IRA. Peripheral atomoxetine administration at a dosage that reduces S-IRA (15mg/kg, IP) slightly increased basal ventilation and the ventilatory response to 7\% CO2, but exerted no effect on heart rate in anesthetized DBA/1 mice. IP injection of atomoxetine produced no effect on the heart rate and blood pressures in conscious mice. These data suggest that atomoxetine suppresses S-IRA through direct effects on the CNS and potentially through enhanced lung ventilation in DBA/1 mice.",

author = "Kang, Jing-Qiong",
abstract = "Seizure disorders are very common and affect 3\% of the general population. The recurrent unprovoked seizures that are also called epilepsies are highly diverse as to both underlying genetic basis and clinic presentations. Recent genetic advances and sequencing technologies indicate that many epilepsies previously thought to be without known causes, or idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs), are virtually genetic epilepsy as they are caused by genetic variations. IGEs are estimated to account for ∼15-20\% of all epilepsies. Initially IGEs were primarily considered channelopathies, because the first genetic defects identified in IGEs involved ion channel genes. However, new findings indicate that mutations in many non ion channel genes are also involved in addition to those in ion channel genes. Interestingly, mutations in many genes associated with epilepsy affect GABAergic signaling, a major biological pathway in epilepsy. Additionally, many antiepileptic drugs work via enhancing GABAergic signaling. Hence, the review will focus on the mutations that impair GABAergic signaling and selectively discuss the newly identified STXBP1, PRRT2, and DNM1 in addition to those long-established epilepsy ion channel genes that also impair GABAergic signaling like SCN1A and GABAA receptor subunit genes. GABAergic signaling includes the pre- and post- synaptic mechanisms. Some mutations, such as STXBP1, PRRT2, DNM1, and SCN1A, impair GABAergic signaling mainly via pre-synaptic mechanisms while those mutations in GABAA receptor subunit genes impair GABAergic signaling via post-synaptic mechanisms. Nevertheless, these findings suggest impaired GABAergic signaling is a converging pathway of defects for many ion channel or non ion channel mutations associated with genetic epilepsies.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a leading cause of premature mortality in patients with epilepsy, and has been linked to multiple risk factors, including gender and early age at seizure onset. Despite the lack of a targeted therapy for SUDEP, it has recently been shown that a high-fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) enhances longevity in the epileptic Kcna1-null (KO) mouse, a validated model of SUDEP. Here, we asked whether the KD-driven prolongation of lifespan in KO mice is dependent on sex and/or age at treatment onset. We found that as KO mice aged, their daily seizure frequency steadily increased, but had early demise by postnatal day (PD) 46.9$\pm$0.8. In KO mice started on the KD at PD30, longevity was extended to a mean of PD69.8$\pm$1.7, accompanied with improved seizure control. Interestingly, while seizure control on the KD was similar between male and female mice, KD-fed female KO mice survived longer than their male counterparts. Further, epileptic mice initiated on the KD at PD25 had longer lifespans compared to those placed on the KD starting at PD35. Collectively, these data further support the notion that the KD can retard disease progression and sudden death in KO mice, but that this beneficial action is influenced by gender and age at the start of treatment.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: 1) Characterize the evolution of microstructural changes in the contralateral, non-operated hippocampus-using longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-following surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). 2) Characterize the downstream extra-hippocampal volumetric changes of the fornix and mammillary bodies after TLE surgery. 3) Examine the relationship between these measures and seizure/cognitive outcome. METHODS: Serial structural and DTI brain MRI scans were collected in 25 TLE patients pre- and post-surgery (anterior temporal lobectomy, ATL - 13; selective amygdalohippocampectomy, SelAH - 12) and in 12 healthy controls. Contralateral hippocampal fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were computed with manual hippocampal tracings as volumes of interest following co-registration to anatomical images. Fornix and mammillary body volumetry was performed by manual segmentation. RESULTS: After surgery, the non-resected hippocampus showed significant postoperative decline in FA (p = 0.0001), with increase of MD (p = 0.01) and RD (p = 0.0001). In contrast to the timing of our previously reported volume changes where atrophy is observed in the first week, diffusion changes occurred late, taking 1-3 years to develop and are not significant at one week after surgery. Diffusion changes are accompanied by delayed limbic circuit volume loss in the mammillary bodies (35\%; p < 0.0001) and fornix (24\%; p < 0.0001) compared to baseline. There was no correlation between postoperative diffusion or structural changes and memory score nor did the degree of postoperative change in hippocampal DTI parameters, mammillary body volume or fornix volume vary significantly based on seizure outcome. SIGNIFICANCE: Differences observed in the timing of postoperative volume (first week) and FA/MD (one year) changes would suggest that early contralateral hippocampal atrophy is not secondary to fluid shifts (dehydration) while the late DTI changes suggest ongoing microstructural changes extending beyond the early postoperative period. Postoperative hippocampal diffusion changes are accompanied by delayed mammillary body and fornix volume loss which did not differ when stratified by seizure outcome nor was correlated with degree of hippocampal diffusion change. Finally, we did not identify any significant correlation between postoperative diffusion parameter change and memory performance.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between alcohol use and seizures in acutely hospitalized patients. We wished to study the extent of the problem as well as the clinical characteristics of people with various forms of alcohol-related seizures, including their drinking pattern. METHOD: After admission, a semi-structured interview took place with 134 consecutive patients (epilepsy 92, single seizures 42). Alcohol use was assessed by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and by the number of alcohol units consumed during 6 days prior to the seizure. Sleep time was recorded during the previous 3 days and nights. A follow-up telephone interview covering the same weekdays was performed on a seizure-free day at least 4 weeks later. RESULTS: 28\% of patients had AUDIT scores $\geq$8 (hazardous drinking); 22\% in epilepsy, 43\% in single seizures (p = .012). Non-focal seizures were increased in single seizures, suggesting a withdrawal mechanism. In the 58 epilepsy patients with social drinking (excluded hazardous drinking or excessive binging), the alcohol intake was not different prior to seizure compared to follow-up, downgrading the role of modest alcohol intake as a seizure precipitant in epilepsy. On the other hand, a high percentage of binge drinkers had epilepsy (57\%), and in the subgroup of Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE) even social drinking was associated with seizures. Seizures peaked on Sundays and Mondays. Less sleep prior to the seizure was associated with hazardous drinking. CONCLUSION: Alcohol is a major seizure precipitant in the context of hazardous drinking and withdrawal. In people with epilepsy, occasional binge drinking is associated with loss of seizure control. Social drinking is an uncommon cause of seizure breakthrough in predominantly focal epilepsy, but caution is warranted in IGE. Alcohol intake prior to a seizure is often accompanied by other triggers, such as sleep loss. Alcohol alone should not always be blamed.",

author = "Kommajosyula, Srinivasa P and Tupal, Srinivasan and Faingold, Carl L",
abstract = "Post-ictal cardiorespiratory failure is implicated as a major cause of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients. The DBA/1 mouse model of SUDEP is abnormally susceptible to fatal seizure-induced cardiorespiratory failure (S-CRF) induced by convulsant drug, hyperthermia, electroshock, and acoustic stimulation. Clinical and pre-clinical studies have implicated periaqueductal gray (PAG) abnormalities in SUDEP. Recent functional neuroimaging studies observed that S-CRF resulted in selective changes in PAG neuronal activity in DBA/1 mice. The PAG plays a critical compensatory role for respiratory distress caused by numerous physiological challenges in non-epileptic individuals. These observations suggest that abnormalities in PAG-mediated cardiorespiratory modulation may contribute to S-CRF in DBA/1 mice. To evaluate this, electrical stimulation (20 Hz, 20-100 $\mu$A, 10 s) was presented in the PAG of anesthetized DBA/1 and C57BL/6 (non-epileptic) control mice, and post-stimulus changes in respiration [inter-breath interval (IBI)] and heart rate variability (HRV) were examined. The post-stimulus period was considered analogous to the post-ictal period when S-CRF occurred in previous DBA/1 mouse studies. PAG stimulation caused significant intensity-related decreases in IBI in both mouse strains. However, this effect was significantly reduced in DBA/1 vis-a-vis C57BL/6 mice. These changes began immediately following cessation of stimulation and remained significant for 10 s. This time period is critical for initiating resuscitation to successfully prevent seizure-induced death in previous DBA/1 mouse experiments. Significant post-stimulus increases in HRV were also seen at $\geq$60 $\mu$A in the PAG in C57BL/6 mice, which were absent in DBA/1 mice. These data along with previous neuroimaging findings suggest that compensatory cardiorespiratory modulation mediated by PAG is deficient, which may be important to the susceptibility of DBA/1 mice to S-CRF. These observations suggest that correcting this deficit pharmacologically or by electrical stimulation may help to prevent S-CRF. These findings further support the potential importance of PAG abnormalities to human SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Recent research suggests that obstructive laryngospasm and consequent respiratory arrest may be a mechanism in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We sought to test a new hypothesis that this laryngospasm is caused by seizures driving reflux of stomach acid into the larynx, rather than spontaneous pathological activity in the recurrent laryngeal nerve. APPROACH: We used an acute kainic acid model under urethane anesthesia to observe seizure activity in Long-Evans rats. We measured the pH in the esophagus and respiratory activity. In a subset of experiments, we blocked acid movement up the esophagus with a balloon catheter. MAIN RESULTS: In all cases of sudden death, terminal apnea was preceded by a large pH drop from 7 to 2 in the esophagus. In several animals we observed acidic fluid exiting the mouth, sometimes in large quantities. In animals where acid movement was blocked, sudden deaths did not occur. No acid was detected in controls. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that acid movement up the esophagus is a trigger for sudden death in KA induced seizures. The fact that blocking acid also eliminates sudden death implies causation. These results may provide insight to the mechanism of SUDEP in humans.",

abstract = "Wearable automated seizure detection devices offer a high potential to improve seizure management, through continuous ambulatory monitoring, accurate seizure counts, and real-time alerts for prompt intervention. More importantly, these devices can be a life-saving help for people with a higher risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), especially in case of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The Embrace and E4 wristbands (Empatica) are the first commercially available multimodal wristbands that were designed to sense the physiological hallmarks of ongoing GTCS: while Embrace only embeds a machine learning-based detection algorithm, both E4 and Embrace devices are equipped with motion (accelerometers, ACC) and electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors and both the devices received medical clearance (E4 from EU CE, Embrace from EU CE and US FDA). The aim of this contribution is to provide updated evidence of the effectiveness of GTCS detection and monitoring relying on the combination of ACM and EDA sensors. A machine learning algorithm able to recognize ACC and EDA signatures of GTCS-like events has been developed on E4 data, labeled using gold-standard video-EEG examined by epileptologists in clinical centers, and has undergone continuous improvement. While keeping an elevated sensitivity to GTCS (92-100\%), algorithm improvements and growing data availability led to lower false alarm rate (FAR) from the initial ˜2 down to 0.2-1 false alarms per day, as showed by retrospective and prospective analyses in inpatient settings. Algorithm adjustment to better discriminate real-life physical activities from GTCS, has brought the initial FAR of ˜6 on outpatient real life settings, down to values comparable to best-case clinical settings (FAR < 0.5), with comparable sensitivity. Moreover, using multimodal sensing, it has been possible not only to detect GTCS but also to quantify seizure-induced autonomic dysfunction, based on automatic features of abnormal motion and EDA. The latter biosignal correlates with the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression, a biomarker observed in 100\% of monitored SUDEP cases.",

HR decreased in both epileptic baboons, but while HRV improved in EB1, it decreased in EB2. EB2 succumbed to SUDEP after 9 months. This pilot study demonstrates abnormalities in HR, HRV and QTc-intervals in epileptic baboons. HF VNS Therapy demonstrated different effects on HRV in the two epileptic baboons, which, in addition to persistent GTCS and elevated HR, may have contributed to SUDEP risk in EB2.

Noda epileptic rat (NER) is genetic epilepsy model rat which exhibits spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTC) approximately once per 30 h and frequent dialeptic seizure (DS). We performed acute and chronic VNS on NER to focus on the acute and chronic anti-epileptic effect and neuronal activity change by VNS. METHODS: We performed acute VNS (2 h) on 22 NERs (VNS, n = 11, control, n = 11), then subsequently administered chronic (4 weeks) VNS on 10 of 22 NERs (VNS n = 5, control n = 5). We evaluated the acute and chronic anti-seizure effects of VNS on GTC and DS by behavioral and electroencephalographical observation (2 h every week). We carried out double immunofluorescence for biomarkers of short-term (c-Fos) and long-term ($\Delta$FosB) neuronal activation to map regions in the brain that were activated by acute (VNS n = 6, control n = 6) or chronic VNS (VNS n = 5, control n = 5). Furthermore, we performed chronic VNS (4 w) on 12 NERs (VNS n = 6, control n = 6) with long-term observation (8 h a day, 5d per week) to obtain an adequate number of GTCs to elucidate the time dependent anti-epileptic effect on GTC. RESULTS: Acute VNS treatment reduced GTC seizure frequency and total duration of the DS. Chronic VNS resulted in a time-dependent reduction of DS frequency and duration. However, chronic VNS did not show time-dependent reduction of GTC frequency. There were significant c-Fos expressions in the central medial nucleus (CM), mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MDM), locus coeruleus (LC), and nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) after acute VNS. And there were significant $\Delta$FosB expressions in the lateral septal nucleus (LSV), medial septal nucleus (MSV), MDM, and pontine reticular nucleus caudal (PnC) after chronic VNS. Any decrease in frequency of GTCs by chronic VNS could not be confirmed even with long-term observation. CONCLUSION: We confirmed acute VNS significantly reduced the frequency of GTC and duration of DS. Chronic VNS decreased the frequency and duration of DS in a time-dependent manner. The brainstem and midline thalamus were activated after acute and chronic VNS. The forebrain was activated only after chronic VNS.",

abstract = "Introduction Ictal central apnea (ICA) occurs in up to 44\% focal seizures (temporal > extratemporal) and precedes scalp electrographic (EEG) seizure onset in 54\% of them. Central apnea can be elicited by electrical stimulation of mesial temporal structures (amygdala, hippocampus, and anteromesial parahippocampal and fusiform gyri), known symptomatogenic anatomical substrates for ICA. We aimed to analyze ICA value as an early semiological sign in invasive evaluation of suspected mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Methods We examined seizure records of intractable, suspected MTLE patients undergoing intracranial EEG (ICEEG) evaluations who had simultaneous respiratory belts with artifact-free signal. Results We analyzed 32 seizures (11 patients). ICA was seen in 22/32 (68.7\%) seizures in 9 patients, was the first clinical manifestation in all of them, and the only clinical sign in 5/32 (15.6\%). ICA onset occurred simultaneously or after ICEEG seizure onset in 20/22 (91\%) seizures by 4.9 +4.6 [0-14] seconds. In one patient with bilateral amygdalar and hippocampal implantation, ICA occurred before ICEEG seizure onset, indicating seizure discharge in an untargeted, probably extra amygdalohippocampal, symptomatogenic location. Conclusions ICA incidence in mesial temporal lobe (MTL) seizures is 68.7\%. ICA is often the first clinical sign and sometimes the only clinical manifestation in MTLE, but usually goes unrecognized. ICA recognition may help anatomo-electro-clinical localization of clinical seizure onset to known symptomatogenic areas. ICA preceding ICEEG onset may indicate inadequate putative epileptogenic zone coverage, and may impact surgical outcomes. Respiratory monitoring in surgical evaluations is of critical importance and should be carried out as standard of care.",

title = "Serotonin {5-HT4} receptors play a critical role in the action of fenfluramine to block seizure-induced sudden death in a mouse model of {SUDEP}",
author = "Tupal, Srinivasan and Faingold, Carl L",
abstract = "RATIONALE: Our previous study showed that the recently approved anticonvulsant drug, fenfluramine, which enhances the release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the brain, prevents seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) in the DBA/1 mouse model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The present study examined the role of 5-HT receptor subtypes in mediating the effect of this agent by combined administration of fenfluramine with selective 5-HT receptor antagonists prior to seizure in DBA/1 mice. METHODS: Fenfluramine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to primed DBA/1 mice, and audiogenic seizure (Sz) was induced 16 h later. Thirty min prior to Sz induction a selective antagonist acting on 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 5-HT4, 5-HT5A, 5-HT6 or 5-HT7 receptors at a sub-toxic dose was administered, and changes in seizure-induced behaviors were evaluated. Follow-up studies examined the effect of administration of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, BIMU 8, as well as the effect of co-administration of ineffective doses of fenfluramine and BIMU-8 on Sz behaviors. RESULTS: The 5-HT4 antagonist (GR125487) was the only 5-HT receptor antagonist that was able to reverse the action of fenfluramine to block Sz and S-IRA. Treatment with the 5-HT4 receptor agonist (BIMU-8), or co-administration of ineffective doses of BIMU-8 and fenfluramine significantly reduced the incidence of S-IRA and tonic Sz in DBA/1 mice. The antagonists for 5-HT3, 5-HT5A 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors did not significantly affect the action of fenfluramine. However, the 5-HT1A and the 5-HT2 antagonists enhanced the anticonvulsant effects of fenfluramine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the action of fenfluramine to prevent seizure-induced sudden death in DBA/1 mice is mediated primarily by activation of 5-HT4 receptors. These studies are the first to indicate the therapeutic potential of 5-HT4 receptor agonists either alone or in combination with fenfluramine for preventing SUDEP. Enhancement of the anticonvulsant effect of fenfluramine by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 antagonists may involve presynaptic actions of these antagonists. Thus, the Sz and S-IRA blocking actions of fenfluramine involve complex interactions with several 5-HT receptor subtypes. These data also provide further support for the serotonin hypothesis of SUDEP.",

Herein, we report that 48\% of adult (median age P96), Fmr1 knockout mice from our colony were found expired in their home cages. We observed and recorded adult Fmr1 knockout mice having spontaneous convulsions in their home cages. In addition, we captured by electroencephalography, an adult Fmr1 knockout mouse having a spontaneous seizure---during pre-ictal, ictal, and postictal phases---which confirmed the presence of a generalized seizure. We did not observe this phenotype in control conspecifics or in juvenile (age <P35) Fmr1 knockout mice. We hypothesized that chronic, random, noise perturbations during development caused the phenotype. We recorded decibels (dB) in our vivarium. The average was 61dB, but operating the automatic door to the vivarium caused spikes to 95dB. We modified the door to eliminate noise spikes, which reduced unexpected deaths to 33\% in Fmr1 knockout mice raised from birth in this environment (P=0.07). As the modifications did not eliminate unexpected deaths, we further hypothesized that building vibrations may also be a contributing factor. After installing anti-vibration pads underneath housing carts, unexpected deaths of Fmr1 knockout mice born and raised in this environment decreased to 29\% (P<0.01 compared to the original environment). We also observed significant sex effects, for example, after interventions to reduce sound and vibration, significantly fewer male, but not female, Fmr1 knockout mice died unexpectedly (P<0.001). The spontaneous seizure phenotype in our Fmr1 knockout mice could serve as a model of seizures observed in individuals with FXS, potentially offering a new translationally-valid phenotype for FXS research.",

RESULTS: We report across seven risk factors from 30,813 users of SeizureTracker™ who had a median length of time using the app of 5.69 years (range from 1 month to 15 years). We found that they are at greater risk for SUDEP than groups from published studies (p < .00001) based on the risk factor of generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

abstract = "The medial extended amygdala modulates pheromonal perception, influencing emotional and social behavior. As the amygdala is part of neuronal circuits that are very sensitive to excitability, its neurons are targets of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy. It has been suggested that the hippocampus is strongly involved this pathology. There is less consistent information, however, on the effects of this disease in the amygdala. The effects of status epilepticus on the medial extended amygdala were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for neural stress and by the amino-cupric-silver technique for neuronal death in rats after kainic acid (KA) administration. Sixty adult Wistar male rats were used. Thirty animals received an injection of KA, and 30 were injected with saline. After 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 h survival the brains were stained for Fos and FosB and for neuronal death. In the present study we show that KA induces Fos and FosB expression in neurons of the medial extended amygdala after 2, 4-48 h, with time courses that are different between them and from control animals. While Fos-IR peaks at 2-4 h post KA and then decreases, FosB-IR increases in the same period reaching its highest expression at 24-48 h. Moreover, KA injection produced massive neuronal death with a peak at 24 h. This neurodegeneration paralleled FosB-IR protein expression. These findings show that KA produces neuronal stress and activation of early genes and neuronal death in the medial extended amygdala, demonstrating the vulnerability of its neurons to the epileptogenic effects of KA.",

abstract = "Pilocarpine administration to rats results in status epilepticus (SE) and after a latency period to the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. The model is commonly used to investigate mechanisms of epileptogenesis as well as the antiepileptic effects of novel compounds. Surprisingly, there have been no video-EEG studies determining the duration of latency period from SE to the appearance of the first spontaneous seizures or the type and frequency of spontaneous seizures at early phase of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy even though such information is critical for design of such studies. To address these questions, we induced SE with pilocarpine in 29 adult male Wistar rats with cortical electrodes. Rats were continuously video-EEG monitored during SE and up to 23 days thereafter. The first spontaneous seizures occurred 7.2+/-3.6 days after SE. During the follow-up, the mean daily seizure frequency was 2.6+/-1.9, the mean seizure duration 47+/-7 s, and the mean behavioral seizure score 3.2+/-0.9. Typically first seizures were partial (score 1-2). Interestingly, spontaneous seizures occurred in clusters with cyclicity, peaking every 5 to 8 days. These data show that in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy the latency period is short. Because many of the early seizures are partial and the seizures occur in clusters, the true phenotype of epilepsy triggered by pilocarpine-induced SE may be difficult to characterize without continuous long-term video-EEG monitoring. Finally, our data suggest that the model can be used for studies aiming at identifying the mechanisms of seizure clustering.",

abstract = "Mossy fiber sprouting and the genesis of ectopic granule cells contribute to reverberating excitation in the dentate gyrus of epileptic brain. This study determined whether the extent of sprouting after status epilepticus in rats correlates with the seizure-induced degeneration of GluR2-immunoreactive (GluR2+) hilar neurons (presumptive mossy cells) and also quantitated granule cell-like GluR2-immunoreactive hilar neurons. Stereological cell counting indicated that GluR2+ neurons account for 57\% of the total hilar neuron population. Prolonged pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus killed 95\% of these cells. A smaller percentage of GluR2+ neurons (74\%) was killed when status epilepticus was interrupted after 1-3.5 h with a single injection of phenobarbital, and the number of residual GluR2+ neurons varied among animals by a factor of 6.2. GluR2+ neurons were not necessarily more vulnerable than other hilar neurons. In rats administered phenobarbital, the extent of recurrent mossy fiber growth varied inversely and linearly with the number of GluR2+ hilar neurons that remained intact (P=0.0001). Thus the loss of each GluR2+ neuron was associated with roughly the same amount of sprouting. These findings support the hypothesis that mossy fiber sprouting is driven largely by the degeneration of and/or loss of innervation from mossy cells. Granule cell-like GluR2-immunoreactive neurons were rarely encountered in the hilus of control rats, but increased 6- to 140-fold after status epilepticus. Their number did not correlate with the extent of hilar cell death or mossy fiber sprouting in the same animal. The morphology, number, and distribution of these neurons suggested that they were hilar ectopic granule cells.",

abstract = "The explanation for the increased prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders in epilepsy patients is uncertain, with both biological and psychosocial factors proposed. Increasing evidence supports the idea of shared neurobiological processes leading both to seizures and to behavioral, emotional and cognitive disturbance. This study addresses this using Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a model of human generalized epilepsy. We subjected GAERS (n=47) and Non-Epileptic Control rats (NEC; n=73) to behavioral measures of depression and anxiety at 7 and 13 weeks of age, ages prior to and after seizure onset. We employed the Sucrose-Preference Test (SPT), the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and the Open Field Arena (OFA). GAERS exhibited significantly greater levels of both depression- and anxiety-like behaviors on all measures, including reduced consumption of sucrose solution in the SPT; lower percentage of time in the open arms of the EPM; and reduced exploratory activity and less time spent in the inner area of the OFA. These differences were evident at both 7 and 13 weeks of age, before and after the onset of epilepsy. Increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors are observed in GAERS. These behavioral differences exist before the onset of seizures indicating that they are not secondary consequences of seizures, and suggest shared factors in the biological diathesis underlying the two kinds of disorder. Studying affective disturbance in animal models of epilepsy may illuminate the pathogenesis of affective disorder more generally, as well as modeling psychiatric comorbidities common in epilepsy patients.",

abstract = "The enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which catalyzes the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, is induced in the brain after various insults, thus contributing to brain inflammatory processes involved in the long-term consequences of such insults. Mounting evidence supports that inflammation may contribute to epileptogenesis and neuronal injury developing after brain insults. Anti-inflammatory treatments, such as selective COX-2 inhibitors, may thus constitute a novel approach for anti-epileptogenesis or disease-modification after brain injuries such as head trauma, cerebral ischemia or status epilepticus (SE). However, recent rat experiments with prophylactic administration of two different COX-2 inhibitors after SE resulted in conflicting results. In the present study, we evaluated whether treatment with parecoxib, a pro-drug of the highly potent and selective COX-2 inhibitor valdecoxib, alters the long-term consequences of a pilocarpine-induced SE in rats. Parecoxib was administered twice daily at 10 mg/kg for 18 days following SE. Five weeks after termination of treatment, spontaneous recurrent seizures were recorded by continuous video/EEG monitoring. Prophylactic treatment with parecoxib prevented the SE-induced increase in prostaglandin E(2) and reduced neuronal damage in the hippocampus and piriform cortex. However, the incidence, frequency or duration of spontaneous seizures developing after SE or the behavioral and cognitive alterations associated with epilepsy were not affected by parecoxib. Only the severity of spontaneous seizures was reduced, indicating a disease-modifying effect. These results substantiate that COX-2 contributes to neuronal injury developing after SE, but inhibition of COX-2 is no effective means to modify epileptogenesis.",

abstract = "Epilepsy and depression share an unusually high coincidence suggestive of a common etiology. Disrupted production of adult-born hippocampal granule cells in both disorders may contribute to this high coincidence. Chronic stress and depression are associated with decreased granule cell neurogenesis. Epilepsy is associated with increased production -- but aberrant integration -- of new cells early in the disease and decreased production late in the disease. In both cases, the literature suggests these changes in neurogenesis play important roles in their respective diseases. Aberrant integration of adult-generated cells during the development of epilepsy may impair the ability of the dentate gyrus to prevent excess excitatory activity from reaching hippocampal pyramidal cells, thereby promoting seizures. Effective treatment of a subset of depressive symptoms, on the other hand, may require increased granule cell neurogenesis, indicating that adult-generated granule cells can modulate mood and affect. Given the robust changes in adult neurogenesis evident in both disorders, competing effects on brain structure are likely. Changes in relative risk, disease course or response to treatment seem probable, but complex and changing patterns of neurogenesis in both conditions will require sophisticated experimental designs to test these ideas. Despite the challenges, this area of research is critical for understanding and improving treatment for patients suffering from these disorders.",

It is presumed that these lipid soluble signaling molecules exert their effects in both the central and peripheral nervous system in large part through direct interaction with metabotropic cannabinoid receptors. These same receptors are also targeted by a variety of endogenous cannabinoids including 2-arachidonoyl glycerol and anandamide. Significant effort over the last decade has produced an enormous advance in our understanding of both the cellular and the synaptic physiology of endogenous lipid signaling systems. This increase in knowledge has left us better prepared to carefully evaluate the potential for both natural and synthetic cannabinoids in the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders. In the case of epilepsy, long standing interest in therapeutic approaches that target endogenous cannabinoid signaling systems are, for the most part, not well justified by available clinical data from human epileptics. Nevertheless, basic science experiments have clearly indicated a key role for endogenous cannabinoid signaling systems in moment to moment regulation of neuronal excitability. Further it has become clear that these systems can both alter and be altered by epileptiform activity in a wide range of in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy. Collectively these observations suggest clear potential for effective therapeutic modulation of endogenous cannabinoid signaling systems in the treatment of human epilepsy, and in fact, further highlight key obstacles that would need to be addressed to reach that goal.",

abstract = "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy and several rodent models allow studying the pathophysiology of this disorder. One of the best characterized models of TLE is the pilocarpine model. The model has been widely used in rats, but relatively few studies report data obtained with mice. This triggered the present study to perform a comprehensive characterization of the mouse pilocarpine model. We used male NMRI mice (28--32 g) and first established the dose--response relationship for pilocarpine (250--400 mg/kg; ip) to induce status epilepticus (SE). This enabled to define the optimal dose (300 mg/kg) producing the highest SE response (50\%) associated with the best survival rate of the animals (90\%). The impact of different durations of SE (0.5--3.0 h) on the time to the onset of the first spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) was recorded during 5-day continuous video monitoring following the SE. Virtually no ``latent'' period was observed as the seizures appeared already within 24--48 h after the pilocarpine-induced SE and 0.5 h duration of the SE was sufficient to trigger SRS. Pharmacokinetics assessment showed that these seizures were not associated with residual pilocarpine exposure as it was cleared from the blood and brain already within 24 h post-injection. Consistent with previous reports from the rat pilocarpine model we observed that the extent of hippocampal reorganization and neuronal loss correlates with the duration of SE. However, the shorter durations of SE (0.5--2.0 h) appeared to produce cell loss restricted mainly to the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Interestingly, we also observed that the number of seizures occurring within 5 days after SE appeared to correlate with the degree of hippocampal damage. Continuous 7-week video-EEG monitoring after the SE revealed that SRS were expressed in a particular pattern of clusters. Taken together, the current study provides an in-depth characterization of the mouse pilocarpine model and confirms several features of the epileptogenesis process previously reported from the rat pilocarpine model. However, the mouse pilocarpine model differs by the rapid onset of seizures and an apparent correlation between their numbers and the degree of histopathological changes. Our findings highlight that the pilocarpine model of TLE in mice is associated with brain pathology akin to different stages of human disease and may provide a valuable tool for the discovery of future antiepileptic drugs with disease-modifying properties.",

abstract = "Growing evidence implicates the dentate gyrus in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Dentate granule cells limit the amount of excitatory signaling through the hippocampus and exhibit striking neuroplastic changes that may impair this function during epileptogenesis. Furthermore, aberrant integration of newly-generated granule cells underlies the majority of dentate restructuring. Recently, attention has focused on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway as a potential mediator of epileptogenic change. Systemic administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin has promising therapeutic potential, as it has been shown to reduce seizure frequency and seizure severity in rodent models. Here, we tested whether mTOR signaling facilitates abnormal development of granule cells during epileptogenesis. We also examined dentate inflammation and mossy cell death in the dentate hilus. To determine if mTOR activation is necessary for abnormal granule cell development, transgenic mice that harbored fluorescently-labeled adult-born granule cells were treated with rapamycin following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Systemic rapamycin effectively blocked phosphorylation of S6 protein (a readout of mTOR activity) and reduced granule cell mossy fiber axon sprouting. However, the accumulation of ectopic granule cells and granule cells with aberrant basal dendrites was not significantly reduced. Mossy cell death and reactive astrocytosis were also unaffected. These data suggest that anti-epileptogenic effects of mTOR inhibition may be mediated by mechanisms other than inhibition of these common dentate pathologies. Consistent with this conclusion, rapamycin prevented pathological weight gain in epileptic mice, suggesting that rapamycin might act on central circuits or even peripheral tissues controlling weight gain in epilepsy.",

abstract = "SCN8A encephalopathy is a severe, early-onset epilepsy disorder resulting from de novo gain-of-function mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6. To identify the effects of this disorder on mRNA expression, RNA-seq was performed on brain tissue from a knock-in mouse expressing the patient mutation p.Asn1768Asp (N1768D). RNA was isolated from forebrain, cerebellum, and brainstem both before and after seizure onset, and from age-matched wildtype littermates. Altered transcript profiles were observed only in forebrain and only after seizures. The abundance of 50 transcripts increased >3-fold and 15 transcripts decreased >3-fold after seizures. The elevated transcripts included two anti-convulsant neuropeptides and more than a dozen genes involved in reactive astrocytosis and response to neuronal damage. There was no change in the level of transcripts encoding other voltage-gated sodium, potassium or calcium channels. Reactive astrocytosis was observed in the hippocampus of mutant mice after seizures. There is considerable overlap between the genes affected in this genetic model of epilepsy and those altered by chemically induced seizures, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, and inflammation. The data support the view that gain-of-function mutations of SCN8A lead to pathogenic alterations in brain function contributing to encephalopathy.",

Patients with SCN1A mutations often experience prolonged early-life febrile seizures (FSs), raising the possibility that these events may influence epileptogenesis and lead to more severe adult phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we subjected 21-23-day-old mice expressing the human SCN1A GEFS+ mutation R1648H to prolonged hyperthermia, and then examined seizure and behavioral phenotypes during adulthood. We found that early-life FSs resulted in lower latencies to induced seizures, increased severity of spontaneous seizures, hyperactivity, and impairments in social behavior and recognition memory during adulthood. Biophysical analysis of brain slice preparations revealed an increase in epileptiform activity in CA3 pyramidal neurons along with increased action potential firing, providing a mechanistic basis for the observed worsening of adult phenotypes. These findings demonstrate the long-term negative impact of early-life FSs on disease outcomes. This has important implications for the clinical management of this patient population and highlights the need for therapeutic interventions that could ameliorate disease progression.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a catastrophic form of paediatric epilepsy associated with multiple comorbidities mainly caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene. DS progresses in three different phases termed febrile, worsening and stabilization stage. Mice that are haploinsufficient for Scn1a faithfully model each stage of DS, although various aspects have not been fully described, including the temporal appearance and sex differences of the epilepsy and comorbidities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the epilepsy landscape according to the progression of DS and the long-term co-morbidities in the Scn1a(+/-)tm1Kea DS mouse line that are not fully understood yet. METHODS: Male and female F1.Scn1a(+/+) and F1.Scn1a(+/-)tm1Kea mice were assessed in the hyperthermia model or monitored by video electroencephalogram (vEEG) and wireless video-EEG according to the respective stage of DS. Long-term comorbidities were investigated through a battery of behaviour assessments in ~6 month-old mice. RESULTS: At P18, F1.Scn1a(+/-)tm1Kea mice showed the expected sensitivity to hyperthermia-induced seizures. Between P21 and P28, EEG recordings in F1.Scn1a(+/-)tm1Kea mice combined with video monitoring revealed a high frequency of SRS and SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy). Power spectral analyses of background EEG activity also revealed that low EEG power in multiple frequency bands was associated with SUDEP risk in F1.Scn1a(+/-)tm1Kea mice during the worsening stage of DS. Later, SRS and SUDEP rates stabilized and then declined in F1.Scn1a(+/-)tm1kea mice. Incidence of SRS ending with death in F1.Scn1a(+/-)tm1kea mice displayed variations with the time of day and sex, with female mice displaying higher numbers of severe seizures resulting in greater SUDEP risk. F1.Scn1a(+/-)tm1kea mice ~6 month-old displayed fewer behavioural impairments than expected including hyperactivity, impaired exploratory behaviour and poor nest building performance. SIGNIFICANCE: These results reveal new features of this model that will optimize use and selection of phenotype assays for future studies on the mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of DS.",

Here, we found that both the locus coeruleus (LC) and peripheral noradrenergic neurotransmission were involved in S-IRA and the protective effect of atomoxetine in reducing the occurrence of SIRA and SUDEP could be reversed by esmolol hydrochloride. Moreover, we investigated the connection between the LC and heart implicated in the modulation of SUDEP by fiber photometry. These data suggested that noradrenergic neurons in the LC might regulate the occurrence of SUDEP through $\beta$1-adrenergic receptors on cardiomyocytes.

This study investigates emotional processing with an objective measure of emotional reactivity in patients with TLE and patients with PNES. Methods : 34 patients with TLE and 14 patients with PNES were evaluated on skin conductance responses (SCR) to emotions induced by short films and compared to 34 healthy controls. An attention and a suppression condition were performed while viewing the films. Results : The both groups of patients disclosed lower SCR to emotions compared to controls, mainly in suppression condition. While TLE patients had lower SCR in attention condition than controls for fear, sadness and happiness, PNES had lower SCR only for happiness. In suppression condition, both had lower SCR than controls except for peacefulness in both groups and sadness in PNES. Subjective evaluations revealed that both patient's groups scored a higher intensity for sadness than controls in attention and lower for in fear and disgust in suppression only in TLE. Limitations : The sample size in the PNES group and the lack of a control group with similar levels of mood symptoms limited the interpretation of our results. Conclusion : As no correlation were found between SCR to emotions and scores of affective disorders, this pattern of responses might be underpinned by specific pathophysiological and cognitive mechanisms related to TLE and to PNES. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting emotional autonomic responses can be of interest in the management of these conditions.",

abstract = "Anxiety is often comorbid with pain. Delta opioid receptors (DORs) are promising targets for the treatment of pain and mental disorders with little addictive potential. However, their roles in anxiety symptoms at different stages of pain are unclear. In the current study, mice with inflammatory pain at the 4th hour following complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection displayed significant anxiety-like behavior, which disappeared at the 7th day. Combining electrophysiology, optogenetics, and pharmacology, we found that activation of delta opioid receptor 1 (DOR1) in the central nucleus amygdala (CeA) inhibited both the anxiolytic excitatory input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the anxiogenic excitatory input from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN). In contrast, activation of delta opioid receptor 2 (DOR2) did not affect CeA excitatory synaptic transmission in normal and 4-hour CFA mice but inhibited the excitatory projection from the PBN rather than the BLA in 7-day CFA mice. Furthermore, the function of both DOR1 and DOR2 was downregulated to the point of not being detectable in the CeA of mice at the 21st day following CFA injection. Taken together, these results suggest that functional switching of DOR1 and DOR2 is associated with anxiety states at different stages of pain via modulating the activity of specific pathways (BLA-CeA and PBN-CeA).",

Levels of iGluR subunits in Balb/c and NMRI mice were compared using semiquantitative immunohistochemistry. The alterations in the neuronal circuitry were validated by neuropeptide Y (NPY) and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) immunostainings. Immunohistochemistry showed interstrain laminar differences in some subunits of both the control and PILO-treated animals. The seizure-induced irreversible neuronal changes were accompanied by reduced GluA1 and GluA2 levels. Their changes were inversely correlated in the individual NMRI mice by Pearson's method. Increase in NPY immunoreactivity showed positive correlation with GluA1, and negative correlation with GluA2. The NMRI strain was susceptible to PILO-induced hippocampal sclerosis, while the Balb/c animals showed resistance. Basal levels of iGluRs differ in mouse strains, which may account for the interstrain differences in their reactions to the convulsant.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: A review study on the biochemistry of epilepsy showed that in epileptic patients, serum glucose and cholesterol concentrations are low, sodium is unaffected, potassium increases, glucose is high and mild hypocalcemia. We have conducted a biochemical study on sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) cases in an attempt to establish the characteristic biochemical values to diagnose these deaths. METHODS: This was a hospital based case-control study done at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for one year. Twenty SUDEP cases and 20 age- and sex-matched controls were included in the study. Femoral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous humor, and pericardial fluid were biochemically analyzed for sodium, potassium, calcium, glucose, N-acetyl- cysteine activated creatine kinase (CK-NAC) and isoenzyme CK-MB. RESULT: Serum sodium, CK-MB and CK-NAC level was found significantly increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases in comparison to non-epileptic deaths. Likewise, in CSF, sodium and CK-NAC was found increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases. In vitreous humor, sodium and CK-MB level was found increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases in comparison to non-epileptic deaths. In pericardial fluid, sodium, CK-NAC and CK-MB level was found increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases in comparison to non-epileptic deaths. CONCLUSION: It concludes that high sodium level and low potassium level could be associated with SUDEP. However, this is a small size study, a larger study is needed to verify the findings. Furthermore, it is difficult to conclude whether these findings are exclusive to SUDEP.",

abstract = "Sudden and unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) represents the predominant cause of premature deaths in young adults with epilepsy and is more common with patients with poorly controlled and generalized convulsive seizures. It is reported that there are 1,16 cases for every 1000 subjects affected with epilepsy. This review takes stock of the current problems and issues in the autopsy of cases of sudden death with epileptic people. For this purpose, all the possible findings of post-mortem examinations reported in the literature were analyzed and summarized, which can currently be considered useful for autopsy diagnoses as well as in the comprehension of the physiopathology of SUDEP. The enormous limitation of forensic pathology studies is the complete lack of a specific SUDEP diagnostic marker. Only in a few cases was it possible to find pathological signs of the brain that would clarify epilepsy-related deaths. Genetic research has tracked down variants of neurocardiac genes of ion channels in a restricted percentage of suspected SUDEP cases. The actual pathogenicity test requires an in-depth statistical analysis in order to prove there is a real excess of variants and evidence that the mutation alters the function. Despite scientific efforts, it is often difficult to distinguish SUDEP from other causes of sudden death. For these reasons, it will be necessary to create an international standard SUDEP death scene investigation and postmortem examination protocols. Further future studies of immunohistochemistry or genetics may help and may facilitate post-mortem diagnosis in cases of presumed SUDEP.",

abstract = "Understanding the pathophysiogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) largely rests on the use of models of status epilepticus (SE), as in the case of the pilocarpine model. The main features of TLE are: (i) epileptic foci in the limbic system; (ii) an ``initial precipitating injury''; (iii) the so-called ``latent period''; and (iv) the presence of hippocampal sclerosis leading to reorganization of neuronal networks. Many of these characteristics can be reproduced in rodents by systemic injection of pilocarpine; in this animal model, SE is followed by a latent period and later by the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). These processes are, however, influenced by experimental conditions such as rodent species, strain, gender, age, doses and routes of pilocarpine administration, as well as combinations with other drugs administered before and/or after SE. In the attempt to limit these sources of variability, we evaluated the methodological procedures used by several investigators in the pilocarpine model; in particular, we have focused on the behavioural, electrophysiological and histopathological findings obtained with different protocols. We addressed the various experimental approaches published to date, by comparing mortality rates, onset of SRSs, neuronal damage, and network reorganization. Based on the evidence reviewed here, we propose that the pilocarpine model can be a valuable tool to investigate the mechanisms involved in TLE, and even more so when standardized to reduce mortality at the time of pilocarpine injection, differences in latent period duration, variability in the lesion extent, and SRS frequency.",

Advances in molecular genetic methods have allowed the engineering of increasingly sophisticated animal models of cortical malformations and associated epilepsy.

Neural tissues can be maintained in vitro for hours, and in neuronal or organotypic slice cultures for several weeks. A variety of drugs and other agents increase activity in these in vitro conditions, in many cases resulting in epileptiform activity, thus providing a direct model of symptomatic seizures. We review these preparations and the experimental manipulations used to induce epileptiform activity. The most common of drugs used are GABAA receptor antagonists and potassium channel blockers (notably 4-aminopyridine). Muscarinic agents also can induce epileptiform synchronization in vitro, and include potassium channel inhibition amongst their cellular actions. Manipulations of extracellular ions are reviewed in another paper in this special issue, as are ex vivo slices prepared from chronically epileptic animals and from people with epilepsy. More complex slices including extensive networks and/or several connected brain structures can provide insights into the dynamics of long range connections during epileptic activity. Visualization of slices also provides opportunities for identification of living neurons and for optical recording/stimulation and manipulation. Overall, the analysis of the epileptiform activity induced in brain tissue in vitro has played a major role in advancing our understanding of the cellular and network mechanisms of epileptiform synchronization, and it is expected to continue to do so in future.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Dravet Syndrome (DS) is an epileptic disorder characterized by spontaneous and thermally-induced seizures, hyperactivity, cognitive deficits, autistic-like behaviors, and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). DS is caused by de novo loss-of-function mutations in the SCN1A gene. Selective loss of GABAergic interneuron excitability is the primary cause of the disease. Up to 60\% of Scn1a+/- mice die from SUDEP before sexual maturity. NEW METHOD: We used Cre-Lox technology to conditionally delete Scn1a in all epiblast-derived somatic cells by crossing a floxed Scn1a mouse with a mouse expressing Cre under the Meox2 promoter. RESULTS: Parental Scn1a flox (F) mice, parental Meox2 Cre+ mice, and their F/+:Meox2-Cre- offspring were phenotypically normal and did not prematurely die. In contrast, F/+:Meox2-Cre+ offspring recapitulated DS seizure and behavioral phenotypes. Unexpectedly, male F/+:Meox2-Cre+ mice demonstrated impaired social interaction, while females did not. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: In the previous models, colony maintenance required breeding SUDEP survivors, which greatly increased colony size required to sustain experimental animal production, and raised the concern that surviving breeders have epigenetic traits that impart new phenotypes to their offspring. Our method greatly facilitates breeding, recapitulates DS phenotypes, eliminates concerns about parents that are survivors, and provides initial evidence for unexpected sex-dependent social interaction impairment. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a more efficient mouse model of human DS that demonstrates an efficient breeding strategy free from potential inherited epigenetic changes and reveals an unexpected sex-specific impairment of social interaction in DS. This new model should have great value to investigators of DS.",

abstract = "Stimulation of cardiac afferents (CA) increased sympathetic outflow and blood pressure. The goal of the current study is to determine the central autonomic nuclei involved in the regulation of cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) which has been proved in previously functional studies. Neuroanatomical method and pseudorabies virus (PRV) transynaptic retrograde trace technique will be performed to investigate the relationship between kidney and heart and the temporal order of the most PRV-labeled neurons in the central nervous system. Recombinant PRV expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was injected into the left kidney of rats as a specific trans-synaptic retrograde tracer in neurons. After 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 days, brain, spinal cord and heart were collected for immunofluorescence staining. The temporal order of PRV labeled neurons was found in the ipsilateral intermediolateral nucleus (IML) of T8-T12 spinal segments on day 3; bilateral rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) on day 4; and left and right ventricular walls and ventricular septum of the heart on day 9. In rats with renal denervation, no PRV-infected neurons or cardiomyocytes were found after PRV injection. In conclusion, PRV trans-synaptic retrograde trace confirms that CA, NTS, PVN, RVLM, IML and renal nerves do exist to be involved in the regulation of CSAR and there is a close relationship between heart and kidney. CA is mainly located in the left ventricular wall, right ventricular wall and ventricular septum.",

abstract = "IMPORTANCE: Epilepsy can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection devices could be invaluable tools for both people with epilepsy, their caregivers, and clinicians as they could alert caretakers about seizures, reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, and provide objective and more reliable seizure tracking to guide treatment decisions or monitor outcomes in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the characteristics of commercial seizure detection tools/devices currently available. METHODS: We performed a systematic search utilizing a diverse set of resources to identify commercially available seizure detection products for consumer use. Performance data was obtained through a systematic review on commercially available products. OBSERVATIONS: We identified 23 products marketed for seizure detection/alerting. Devices utilize a variety of mechanisms to detect seizures, including movement detectors, autonomic change detectors, electroencephalogram (EEG) based detectors, and other mechanisms (audio). The optimal device for a person with epilepsy depends on a variety of factors including the main purpose of the device, their age, seizure type and personal preferences. Only 8 devices have published peer-reviewed performance data and the majority for tonic-clonic seizures. An informed conversation between the clinician and the patient can help guide if a seizure detection device is appropriate. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Seizure detection devices have a potential to reduce morbidity and mortality for certain people with epilepsy. Clinicians should be familiar with the characteristics of commercially available devices to best counsel their patients on whether a seizure detection device may be beneficial and what the optimal devices may be.",

He later had a second seizure after anti-seizure medication taper. This mutation has not previously been reported associated with seizures. Our case suggests that, in patients with this type of C'-terminus mutation and a first seizure or syncope, there is a susceptibility to epilepsy.

In this study, to elucidate the neuronal circuits mediating behavioral thermoregulatory responses, we examined whether neuronal pathways from the PVT to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), which are brain regions implicated in mediating appetitive/approach and aversive/avoidance behaviors, are activated during exposure to hot (38°C) and cold (8°C) environments using c-Fos immunostaining and retrograde tracing. Our results showed activation of neuronal pathways from the PVT to the NAc, BNST, and CeA during exposure to hot and cold environments, suggesting that activation of these pathways may be involved in avoidance behaviors from hot and cold environments for behavioral thermoregulation.",

Although several hypotheses and animal models have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of IS, the pathophysiology of IS has not been elucidated. Recently, we proposed a hypothesis for IS under prenatal stress exposure (also called Zou's hypothesis) by correlating diverse etiologies and prenatal stresses with IS development. This research aims to determine the mechanism through which prenatal stress affects the offspring and establish the potential underlying mechanisms. Pregnant rats were subjected to forced swimming in cold water. Rat pups exposed to prenatal stress were administered with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Exposure to prenatal stress sensitized the rats against development of NMDA-induced spasms. However, this phenomenon was altered by administering adrenocorticotropin. Prenatal stress exposure also altered the hormonal levels and neurotransmitter receptor expression of the developing rats as well as influenced the tissue structure of the brain. These findings suggest that maternal stress could alter the level of endogenous glucocorticoid, which is the basis of IS, and cerebral dysplasia, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), inherited metabolic diseases, and other factors activated this disease in developmental brain.",

author = "Zhang, Rui and Tan, Zheren and Niu, Jianguo and Feng, Hua-Jun",
abstract = "AIMS: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a serious and underestimated public health burden. Both clinical and animal studies show that seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) is the primary cause of death in SUDEP. Our previous studies demonstrated that atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), suppresses S-IRA in DBA/1 mice, suggesting that noradrenergic neurotransmission modulates S-IRA. However, it remains unclear which adrenoceptors are implicated in S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Na{\"\i}ve DBA/1 mice exhibit a low incidence of S-IRA, but after primed by acoustic stimulation, they become consistently susceptible to S-IRA. Atomoxetine, adrenoceptor agonists, antagonists or vehicle was intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered alone or in combination, and the effects of drug treatments on S-IRA incidence and seizure behaviors were examined. KEY FINDINGS: The incidence of S-IRA in primed DBA/1 mice was significantly reduced by clonidine, an $\alpha$2 adrenoceptor agonist, as compared with that of the vehicle control. However, compared with the vehicle control, S-IRA was not altered by cirazoline, an $\alpha$1 agonist. Consistent with previous reports, atomoxetine reduced S-IRA in primed DBA/1 mice. The suppressing effect of atomoxetine on S-IRA was prevented by injection of an $\alpha$2 adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine or atipamezole, but not by prazosin, an $\alpha$1 antagonist. Administration of $\alpha$1 or $\alpha$2 antagonists alone did not promote the incidence of S-IRA in nonprimed DBA/1 mice. SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate that noradrenergic neurotransmission modulates S-IRA predominantly via $\alpha$2 adrenoceptors in DBA/1 mice, indicating that selective activation of $\alpha$2 adrenoceptors can potentially prevent SUDEP.",

abstract = "The roles of cells within the nervous system are based on their properties of excitability, which are in part governed by voltage-gated ion channels. HCN channels underlie the hyperpolarization-activated current, I(h), an important regulator of excitability and rhythmicity through control of basic membrane properties. I(h) is present in multiple neuronal types and regions of the central nervous system, and changes in I(h) alter cellular input-output properties and neuronal circuitry important for behavior such as learning and memory. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of neurological diseases of both the central and peripheral nervous system involves defects in excitability, rhythmicity, and signaling, and animal models of many of these disorders have implicated changes in HCN channels and I(h) as critical for pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent research elucidating the role of HCN channels and I(h) in behavior and disease. These studies have utilized knockout mice as well as animal models of disease to examine how I(h) may be important in regulating learning and memory, sleep, and consciousness, as well as how misregulation of I(h) may contribute to epilepsy, chronic pain, and other neurological disorders. This review will help guide future studies aimed at further understanding the function of this unique conductance in both health and disease of the mammalian brain.",

abstract = "There is clear evidence on the neuroprotective role of the endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling cascade in various models of epilepsy. In particular, increased levels of eCBs protect against kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect and its age-dependence are still unknown. To clarify this issue, we investigated which step of the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of the eCBs may be responsible for the eCB-mediated neuroprotection in the hippocampus of P14 and P56--70 KA-treated rats. We found that both anandamide and N-palmitoylethanolamine, together with their biosynthetic enzyme significantly increased in the hippocampus of younger KA-treated rats, while decreasing in adults. In contrast, the levels of the other major eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, similar to its biosynthetic enzyme, were higher in the hippocampus of P56--70 compared to P14 rats. In line with these data, extracellular field recordings in CA1 hippocampus showed that enhancement of endogenous AEA and 2-AG significantly counteracted KA-induced epileptiform bursting in P56--70 and P14 rats, respectively. On the contrary, while the CB1R antagonist SR141716 per se did not affect the population spike, it did worsen KA-induced bursts, confirming increased eCB tone upon KA treatment. Altogether these data indicate an age-specific alteration of the eCB system caused by KA and provide insights for the protective mechanism of the cannabinoid system against epileptiform discharges.",

Additionally, the cause of SUDEP is still unknown; however, the most commonly suggested mechanisms are cardiac abnormalities during and between seizures. Furthermore, the evidence from the last 10 years suggests that melatonin has an important role in the epileptogenesis process and influences the cardiovascular system as well. The positive effect of melatonin has been demonstrated against different convulsive stimuli in several rodents, including seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole kainate, glutamate, maximal electrical shock and electrically kindled stimulation of amygdala. Clinical studies have also demonstrated a positive role of melatonin on the seizure frequency in children and reduced spiking activity and seizure frequency in patients with intractable epilepsy. In the rat hearts, studies in vivo and in vitro using pharmacological concentrations of melatonin confirmed an anti-arrhythmic effect of this hormone and studies in humans have been shown that chronic heart disease patients have significantly lower melatonin levels in their blood stream than do normal individuals. Thus, caution should be taken in generalization of these findings to epileptic population. Moreover, it is important to note that when dealing with intractable epilepsy that do not respond to any conventional treatment, the additional of melatonin may be evaluated. Taken together, in this paper we suggested a possible relationship between cardiac abnormalities, melatonin and SUDEP.",

abstract = "A theory is proposed to explain the benefits of yoga practices in diverse, frequently comorbid medical conditions based on the concept that yoga practices reduce allostatic load in stress response systems such that optimal homeostasis is restored. It is hypothesized that stress induces (1) imbalance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with decreased parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, (2) underactivity of the gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) system, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter system, and (3) increased allostatic load. It is further hypothesized that yoga-based practices (4) correct underactivity of the PNS and GABA systems in part through stimulation of the vagus nerves, the main peripheral pathway of the PNS, and (5) reduce allostatic load. Depression, epilepsy, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and chronic pain exemplify medical conditions that are exacerbated by stress, have low heart rate variability (HRV) and low GABAergic activity, respond to pharmacologic agents that increase activity of the GABA system, and show symptom improvement in response to yoga-based interventions. The observation that treatment resistant cases of epilepsy and depression respond to vagal nerve stimulation corroborates the need to correct PNS underactivity as part of a successful treatment plan in some cases. According to the proposed theory, the decreased PNS and GABAergic activity that underlies stress-related disorders can be corrected by yoga practices resulting in amelioration of disease symptoms. This has far-reaching implications for the integration of yoga-based practices in the treatment of a broad array of disorders exacerbated by stress.",

abstract = "The origin of post-ictal malfunctions is debatable. We want to propose a novel idea of a cause of these adverse results occurring following epileptic seizures and anesthesia. Previously we have put forward the idea that epileptic seizures termination is caused by the function of the glymphatic system in the brain. A new measurement shows that this system can be much faster than what was estimated before. Moreover, the method enabling this speeding was actually measured in brains of epilepsy subjects. So, the main objection to our model is relegated. As a possible consequence of the glymphatic process, there can be an excess cleaning of the brain's interstitial fluid. We discuss possible adverse results of this process. This over-cleaning (that can, to a lower extent, occur also during anesthesia) which results post-ictally from the previous overexpression of fluid materials by the neurons during their seizure operation, can reduce ingredients essential for regular neuronal functioning, thereby leading to function reduction and EEG suppression which last until those materials are replenished. We argue that this ingredients' scarcity is the cause of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES), of post-ictal immobility (PI) and possibly of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy Patients (SUDEP). Similarly, such cleaning can lead to morbidity and even mortality problems following anesthesia. If our assumption is correct, this understanding of the process of the problems' origin can lead to a method to remedy them by judicial supplement of the lost materials.",

abstract = "Neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) control motivated behaviors such as feeding and ambulatory activity, in part by modulating mesolimbic dopamine (DA) circuits. The hormone, leptin, acts via the long form of the leptin receptor (LepRb) in the brain to signal the repletion of body energy stores, thereby decreasing feeding and promoting activity. LHA LepRb neurons, most of which contain neurotensin (Nts; LepRb(Nts) neurons) link leptin action to the control of mesolimbic DA function and energy balance. To understand potential roles for Nts in these processes, we examined mice null for Nts receptor 1 (NtsR1KO). While NtsR1KO mice consume less food than controls on a chow diet, they eat more and become obese when fed a high-fat, high-sucrose palatable diet; NtsR1KO mice also exhibit augmented sucrose preference, consistent with increased hedonic feeding in these animals. We thus sought to understand potential roles for NtsR1 in the control of the mesolimbic DA system and LHA leptin action. LHA Nts cells project to DA-containing midbrain areas, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SN), where many DA neurons express NtsR1. Furthermore, in contrast to wild-type mice, intra-LHA leptin treatment increased feeding and decreased VTA Th expression in NtsR1KO mice, consistent with a role for NtsR1 signaling from LHA LepRb neurons in the suppression of food intake and control of mesolimbic DA function. Additionally, these data suggest that other leptin-regulated LHA neurotransmitters normally oppose aspects of Nts action to promote balanced responses to leptin.",

author = "Hattiangady, Bharathi and Rao, Muddanna S and Shetty, Ashok K",
abstract = "While it is clear that acute hippocampal injury or status epilepticus increases the production of new neurons in the adult dentate gyrus (DG), the effects of chronic epilepsy on dentate neurogenesis are unknown. We hypothesize that epileptogenic changes and spontaneous recurrent motor seizures (SRMS) that ensue after hippocampal injury or status epilepticus considerably decrease dentate neurogenesis. We addressed this issue by quantifying the number of cells that are positive for doublecortin (DCX, a marker of new neurons) in the DG of adult F344 rats at 16 days and 5 months after an intracerebroventricular kainic acid (ICV KA) administration or after graded intraperitoneal KA (IP KA) injections, models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). At early post-KA administration, the injured hippocampus exhibited increased dentate neurogenesis in both models. Conversely, at 5 months post-KA administration, the chronically epileptic hippocampus demonstrated severely declined neurogenesis, which was associated with considerable SRMS in both KA models. Additionally, stem/progenitor cell proliferation factors, FGF-2 and IGF-1, were decreased in the chronically epileptic hippocampus. Interestingly, the overall decrease in neurogenesis and the extent of SRMS were greater in rats receiving IP KA than rats receiving ICV KA, suggesting that the extent of neurogenesis during chronic TLE exhibits an inverse relationship with SRMS. These results provide novel evidence that chronic TLE is associated with extremely declined dentate neurogenesis. As fraction of newly born neurons become GABA-ergic interneurons, declined neurogenesis may contribute to the increased seizure-susceptibility of the DG in chronic TLE. Likewise, the hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits observed in chronic TLE could be linked at least partially to the declined neurogenesis.",

Here, we examined if inflammatory blockade with celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, could modulate the altered microenvironment in the epileptic rat brain. Celecoxib attenuated the likelihood of developing spontaneous recurrent seizures after pilocarpine-induced prolonged seizure. During the latent period, celecoxib prevented neuronal death and microglia activation in the hilus and CA1 and inhibited the generation of ectopic granule cells in the hilus and new glia in CA1. The direct inhibition of precursor cells by celecoxib was further demonstrated in human neural stem cells culture. These findings raise the evidence of COX-2 induction to act importantly on epileptogenesis and suggest a potential therapeutic role for COX-2 inhibitors in chronic epilepsy.",

Epilepsy was accompanied by the interictal elevation of plasma corticosterone, and by the positively combined dexamethasone/corticotropin releasing hormone test. The extent of the HPA hyperactivity was independent of recurrent seizures, but positively correlated with the severity of depressive behavior.

abstract = "Mutations in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel genes SCN1A and SCN2A are associated with inherited epilepsies, including genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy). The clinical presentation and severity of these epilepsies vary widely, even in people with the same mutation, suggesting the action of environmental or genetic modifiers. To gain support for the hypothesis that genetic modifiers can influence clinical presentation in patients with SCN1A-derived GEFS+, we used mouse models to study the effect of combining the human GEFS+ mutation SCN1A-R1648H with SCN2A, KCNQ2, and SCN8A mutations. Knock-in mice heterozygous for the R1648H mutation (Scn1aRH/+) have decreased thresholds to induced seizures and infrequent spontaneous seizures, whereas homozygotes display spontaneous seizures and premature lethality. Scn2aQ54 transgenic mice have a mutation in Scn2a that results in spontaneous, adult-onset partial motor seizures, and mice carrying the Kcnq2-V182M mutation exhibit increased susceptibility to induced seizures, and rare spontaneous seizures as adults. Combining the Scn1a-R1648H allele with either Scn2aQ54 or Kcnq2V182M/+ results in early-onset, generalized tonic--clonic seizures and juvenile lethality in double heterozygous mice. In contrast, Scn8a mutants exhibit increased resistance to induced seizures. Combining the Scn1a-R1648H and Scn8a-med-jo alleles restores normal thresholds to flurothyl-induced seizures in Scn1aRH/+ heterozygotes and improved survival of Scn1aRH/RH homozygotes. Our results demonstrate that variants in Scn2a, Kcnq2, and Scn8a can dramatically influence the phenotype of mice carrying the Scn1a-R1648H mutation and suggest that ion channel variants may contribute to the clinical variation seen in patients with monogenic epilepsy.",

Here, we analyzed the temporal and spatial evolution of interictal spikes with and without HFOs in the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Depth electrode recordings from dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 region, subiculum and entorhinal cortex (EC), were obtained from rats between the 4th and 15th day after a status epilepticus (SE) induced by i.p. injection of pilocarpine. The first seizure occurred 6.1 $\pm$ 2.5 days after SE (n = 7 rats). Five of 7 animals exhibited interictal spikes that co-occurred with fast ripples accounting for 4.9 $\pm$ 4.6\% of all analyzed interictal spikes (n = 12,886) while all rats showed interictal spikes co-occurring with ripples, accounting for 14.3 $\pm$ 3.4\% of all events. Increased rates of interictal spikes without HFOs in the EC predicted upcoming seizures on the following day, while rates of interictal spikes with fast ripples in CA3 reflected periods of high seizure occurrence. Finally, interictal spikes co-occurring with ripples did not show any specific relation to seizure occurrence. Our findings identify different temporal and spatial developmental patterns for the rates of interictal spikes with or without HFOs in relation with seizure occurrence. These distinct categories of interictal spikes point at dynamic processes that should bring neuronal networks close to seizure generation.",

abstract = "Heterozygous loss-of-function SCN1A mutations cause Dravet syndrome, an epileptic encephalopathy of infancy that exhibits variable clinical severity. We utilized a heterozygous Scn1a knockout (Scn1a(+/-)) mouse model of Dravet syndrome to investigate the basis for phenotype variability. These animals exhibit strain-dependent seizure severity and survival. Scn1a(+/-) mice on strain 129S6/SvEvTac (129.Scn1a(+/-)) have no overt phenotype and normal survival compared with Scn1a(+/-) mice bred to C57BL/6J (F1.Scn1a(+/-)) that have severe epilepsy and premature lethality. We tested the hypothesis that strain differences in sodium current (INa) density in hippocampal neurons contribute to these divergent phenotypes. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recording was performed on acutely-dissociated hippocampal neurons from postnatal days 21-24 (P21-24) 129.Scn1a(+/-) or F1.Scn1a(+/-) mice and wild-type littermates. INa density was lower in GABAergic interneurons from F1.Scn1a(+/-) mice compared to wild-type littermates, while on the 129 strain there was no difference in GABAergic interneuron INa density between 129.Scn1a(+/-) mice and wild-type littermate controls. By contrast, INa density was elevated in pyramidal neurons from both 129.Scn1a(+/-) and F1.Scn1a(+/-) mice, and was correlated with more frequent spontaneous action potential firing in these neurons, as well as more sustained firing in F1.Scn1a(+/-) neurons. We also observed age-dependent differences in pyramidal neuron INa density between wild-type and Scn1a(+/-) animals. We conclude that preserved INa density in GABAergic interneurons contributes to the milder phenotype of 129.Scn1a(+/-) mice. Furthermore, elevated INa density in excitatory pyramidal neurons at P21-24 correlates with age-dependent onset of lethality in F1.Scn1a(+/-) mice. Our findings illustrate differences in hippocampal neurons that may underlie strain- and age-dependent phenotype severity in a Dravet syndrome mouse model, and emphasize a contribution of pyramidal neuron excitability.",

abstract = "SCN1A mutations are the main cause of the epilepsy disorders Dravet syndrome (DS) and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Mutations that reduce the activity of the mouse Scn8a gene, in contrast, are found to confer seizure resistance and extend the lifespan of mouse models of DS and GEFS+. To investigate the mechanism by which reduced Scn8a expression confers seizure resistance, we induced interictal-like burst discharges in hippocampal slices of heterozygous Scn8a null mice (Scn8a(med/+)) with elevated extracellular potassium. Scn8a(med/+) mutants exhibited reduced epileptiform burst discharge activity after P20, indicating an age-dependent increased threshold for induction of epileptiform discharges. Scn8a deficiency also reduced the occurrence of burst discharges in a GEFS+ mouse model (Scn1a(R1648H/+)). There was no detectable change in the expression levels of Scn1a (Nav1.1) or Scn2a (Nav1.2) in the hippocampus of adult Scn8a(med/+) mutants. To determine whether the increased seizure resistance associated with reduced Scn8a expression was due to alterations that occurred during development, we examined the effect of deleting Scn8a in adult mice. Global Cre-mediated deletion of a heterozygous floxed Scn8a allele in adult mice was found to increase thresholds to chemically and electrically induced seizures. Finally, knockdown of Scn8a gene expression in the adult hippocampus via lentiviral Cre injection resulted in a reduction in the number of EEG-confirmed seizures following the administration of picrotoxin. Our results identify the hippocampus as an important structure in the mediation of Scn8a-dependent seizure protection and suggest that selective targeting of Scn8a activity might be efficacious in patients with epilepsy.",

In addition to suffering from the constant stress of living with this neurological condition, patients also frequently experience comorbid psychiatric and cognitive disorders which significantly impact their quality of life. There is growing appreciation that stress, in particular occurring in early life, can negatively impact brain development, creating an enduring vulnerability to develop epilepsy. This aligns with the solid connections between early life environments and the development of psychiatric conditions, promoting the possibility that adverse early life events could represent a common risk factor for the later development of both epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric disorders. The influence of sex has been little studied, but recent research points to potential important interactions, particularly with regard to effects mediated by HPA axis programming. Understanding these interactions, and the underlying molecular mechanisms, will provide important new insights into the causation of both epilepsy and of psychiatric disorders, and potentially open up novel avenues for treatment.",

abstract = "Repeated seizures are often associated with development of refractory chronic epilepsy, the most common form of which is temporal lobe epilepsy. G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2 receptors) regulate neuronal excitability and have been shown to mediate acute anticonvulsant effects of cannabinoids in animal models. However, the potential of cannabinoids to prevent chronic neuronal damage and development of epilepsy remains unexplored. We hypothesized that treatment with a CB receptor agonist after an episode of status epilepticus--but before development of spontaneous recurrent seizures--might prevent the development of functional changes that lead to chronic epilepsy. Using the rat pilocarpine model, a therapeutic approach was simulated by administering the CB agonist, WIN 55,212-2 after an episode of status epilepticus. Epileptic behavior was monitored during development of spontaneous recurrent seizures for up to 6 months. Histology, neurochemistry, redox status and NMDA receptor subunit expression were assessed at 6 months after pilocarpine-induced seizures. Sub-acute treatment with WIN 55,212-2 (for 15 days starting 24h after PILO injection) dramatically attenuated the severity, duration and frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Further, in contrast to vehicle-treated animals, hippocampi from WIN 55,212-2-treated animals showed: normal thiol redox state, normal NR2A and NR2B subunit expression, preservation of GABAergic neurons and prevention of abnormal proliferation of GABAergic progenitors. This study shows for the first time that, after a known inciting event, treatment with a compound targeting CB receptors has the potential to prevent the epileptogenic events that result in chronic epileptic damage.",

abstract = "Dravet syndrome (DS) is characterized by severe infant-onset myoclonic epilepsy along with delayed psychomotor development and heightened premature mortality. A primary monogenic cause is mutation of the SCN1A gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.1. The nature and timing of changes caused by SCN1A mutation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) network, a core area for gating major excitatory input to hippocampus and a classic epileptogenic zone, are not well known. In particularly, it is still not clear whether the developmental deficit of this epileptogenic neural network temporally matches with the progress of seizure development. Here, we investigated the emerging functional and structural deficits of the DG network in a novel mouse model (Scn1a(E1099X/+)) that mimics the genetic deficit of human DS. Scn1a(E1099X/+) (Het) mice, similarly to human DS patients, exhibited early spontaneous seizures and were more susceptible to hyperthermia-induced seizures starting at postnatal week (PW) 3, with seizures peaking at PW4. During the same period, the Het DG exhibited a greater reduction of Nav1.1-expressing GABAergic neurons compared to other hippocampal areas. Het DG GABAergic neurons showed altered action potential kinetics, reduced excitability, and generated fewer spontaneous inhibitory inputs into DG granule cells. The effect of reduced inhibitory input to DG granule cells was exacerbated by heightened spontaneous excitatory transmission and elevated excitatory release probability in these cells. In addition to electrophysiological deficit, we observed emerging morphological abnormalities of DG granule cells. Het granule cells exhibited progressively reduced dendritic arborization and excessive spines, which coincided with imbalanced network activity and the developmental onset of spontaneous seizures. Taken together, our results establish the existence of significant structural and functional developmental deficits of the DG network and the temporal correlation between emergence of these deficits and the onset of seizures in Het animals. Most importantly, our results uncover the developmental deficits of neural connectivity in Het mice. Such structural abnormalities likely further exacerbate network instability and compromise higher-order cognitive processing later in development, and thus highlight the multifaceted impacts of Scn1a deficiency on neural development.",

TRIP8b is an auxiliary subunit of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which have previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of absence seizures. In contrast to mice lacking the pore-forming HCN channel subunit HCN2, TRIP8b knockout mice exhibited normal cardiac and motor function and a less severe seizure phenotype. Evaluating the circuit that underlies absence seizures, we found that TRIP8b knockout mice had significantly reduced HCN channel expression and function in thalamic-projecting cortical layer 5b neurons and thalamic relay neurons, but preserved function in inhibitory neurons of the reticular thalamic nucleus. Our results expand the known roles of TRIP8b and provide new insight into the region-specific functions of TRIP8b and HCN channels in constraining cortico-thalamo-cortical excitability.",

abstract = "Abstract Although novel treatment strategies based on the gene therapy approach for epilepsy has been encouraging, there is still a gap in demonstrating a proof-of-concept in a clinically relevant animal model and study design. In the present study, a conceptually novel framework reflecting a plausible clinical trial for gene therapy of temporal lobe epilepsy was explored: We investigated (i) whether the post intrahippocampal kainate-induced status epilepticus (SE) model of chronic epilepsy in rats could be clinically relevant; and (ii) whether a translationally designed neuropeptide Y (NPY)/Y2 receptor-based gene therapy approach targeting only the seizure-generating focus unilaterally can decrease seizure frequency in this chronic model of epilepsy. Our data suggest that the intrahippocampal kainate model resembles the disease development of human chronic mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE): (i) spontaneous seizures originate in the sclerotic hippocampus; (ii) only a part of the animals develops chronic epilepsy; (iii) animals show largely variable seizure frequency that (iv) tends to progressively increase over time. Despite significant hippocampal degeneration caused by the kainate injection, the use of MRI allowed targeting the recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors encoding NPY and Y2 receptor genes to the remaining dorsal and ventral hippocampal areas ipsilateral to the kainate injection. Continuous video-EEG monitoring demonstrated not only prevention of the progressive increase in seizure frequency in rAAV-NPY/Y2 treated animals as compared to the controls, but even 45\% decrease of seizure frequency in 80\% of the epileptic animals. This translationally designed study in a clinically relevant model of epilepsy suggests that simultaneous overexpression of NPY and Y2 receptors unilaterally in the seizure focus is a relevant and promising approach that can be further validated in more extensive preclinical studies to develop a future treatment strategy for severe, often pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy cases that cannot be offered alternative therapeutic options.",

Optogenetic activation of DLSC suppressed behavioral and electrographic seizures in the pentylenetetrazole (forebrain+brainstem seizures) and Area Tempestas (forebrain/complex partial seizures) models; this effect was specific to activation of DLSC, and not neighboring structures. DLSC activation likewise attenuated seizures evoked by gamma butyrolactone (thalamocortical/absence seizures), or acoustic stimulation of genetically epilepsy prone rates (brainstem seizures). Anticonvulsant effects were seen with stimulation frequencies as low as 5 Hz. Unlike previous applications of optogenetics for the control of seizures, activation of DLSC exerted broad-spectrum anticonvulsant actions, attenuating seizures originating in diverse and distal brain networks.

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The absence epilepsies are presumed to be caused by genetic factors, but the influence of environmental exposures on epilepsy development and severity, and whether this influence is transmitted to subsequent generations, is not well known. We assessed the effects of environmental enrichment on epilepsy and anxiety outcomes in multiple generations of GAERS - a genetic rat model of absence epilepsy that manifests comorbid elevated anxiety-like behaviour. METHODS: GAERS were exposed to environmental enrichment or standard housing beginning either prior to, or after epilepsy onset, and underwent EEG recordings and anxiety testing. Then, we exposed male GAERS to early enrichment or standard housing and generated F1 progeny, which also underwent EEG recordings. Hippocampal CRH mRNA expression and DNA methylation were assessed using RT-PCR and pyrosequencing, respectively. RESULTS: Early environmental enrichment delayed the onset of epilepsy in GAERS, and resulted in fewer seizures in adulthood, compared with standard housed GAERS. Enrichment also reduced the frequency of seizures when initiated in adulthood. Anxiety levels were reduced by enrichment, and these anti-epileptogenic and anxiolytic effects were heritable into the next generation. We also found reduced expression of CRH mRNA in GAERS exposed to enrichment, but this was not due to changes in DNA methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental enrichment produces disease-modifying effects on genetically determined absence epilepsy and anxiety, and these beneficial effects are transferable to the subsequent generation. Reduced CRH expression was associated with these phenotypic improvements. Environmental stimulation holds promise as a naturalistic therapy for genetically determined epilepsy which may benefit subsequent generations.",

author = "LaSarge, Candi L and Pun, Raymund Y K and Muntifering, Michael B and Danzer, Steve C",
abstract = "Abnormal hippocampal granule cells are present in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, and are a prominent feature of most animal models of the disease. These abnormal cells are hypothesized to contribute to epileptogenesis. Isolating the specific effects of abnormal granule cells on hippocampal physiology, however, has been difficult in traditional temporal lobe epilepsy models. While epilepsy induction in these models consistently produces abnormal granule cells, the causative insults also induce widespread cell death among hippocampal, cortical and subcortical structures. Recently, we demonstrated that introducing morphologically abnormal granule cells into an otherwise normal mouse brain - by selectively deleting the mTOR pathway inhibitor PTEN from postnatally-generated granule cells - produced hippocampal and cortical seizures. Here, we conducted acute slice field potential recordings to assess the impact of these cells on hippocampal function. PTEN deletion from a subset of granule cells reproduced aberrant responses present in traditional epilepsy models, including enhanced excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and multiple, rather than single, population spikes in response to perforant path stimulation. These findings provide new evidence that abnormal granule cells initiate a process of epileptogenesis - in the absence of widespread cell death - which culminates in an abnormal dentate network similar to other models of temporal lobe epilepsy. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that accumulation of abnormal granule cells is a common mechanism of temporal lobe epileptogenesis.",

abstract = "Respiratory derangements, including irregular, tachypnic breathing and central or obstructive apnea can be consequences of seizure activity in epilepsy patients and animal models. Periods of seizure-associated central apnea, defined as periods >1s with rapid onset and offset of no airflow during plethysmography, suggest that seizures spread to brainstem respiratory regions to disrupt breathing. We sought to characterize seizure-associated central apneic episodes as an indicator of seizure impact on the respiratory rhythm in rats anesthetized with urethane and given parenteral kainic acid to induce recurring seizures. We measured central apneic period onsets and offsets to determine if onset-offset relations were a consequence of 1) a reset of the respiratory rhythm, 2) a transient pausing of the respiratory rhythm, resuming from the pause point at the end of the apneic period, 3) a transient suppression of respiratory behavior with apnea offset predicted by a continuation of the breathing pattern preceding apnea, or 4) a random re-entry into the respiratory cycle. Animals were monitored with continuous ECG, EEG, and plethysmography. One hundred ninety central apnea episodes (1.04 to 36.18s, mean: 3.2$\pm$3.7s) were recorded during seizure activity from 7 rats with multiple apneic episodes. The majority of apneic period onsets occurred during expiration (125/161 apneic episodes, 78\%). In either expiration or inspiration, apneic onsets tended to occur late in the cycle, i.e. between the time of the peak and end of expiration (82/125, 66\%) or inspiration (34/36, 94\%). Apneic period offsets were more uniformly distributed between early and late expiration (27\%, 34\%) and inspiration (16\%, 23\%). Differences between the respiratory phase at the onset of apnea and the corresponding offset phase varied widely, even within individual animals. Each central apneic episode was associated with a high frequency event in EEG or ECG records at onset. High frequency events that were not associated with flatline plethysmographs revealed a constant plethysmograph pattern within each animal, suggesting a clear reset of the respiratory rhythm. The respiratory rhythm became highly variable after about 1s, however, accounting for the unpredictability of the offset phase. The dissociation of respiratory rhythm reset from the cessation of airflow also suggested that central apneic periods involved activation of brainstem regions serving the diving reflex to eliminate the expression of respiratory movements. This conclusion was supported by the decreased heart rate as a function of apnea duration. We conclude that seizure-associated central apnea episodes are associated with 1) a reset of the respiratory rhythm, and 2) activation of brainstem regions serving the diving reflex to suppress respiratory behavior. The significance of these conclusions is that these details of seizure impact on brainstem circuitry represent metrics for assessing seizure spread and potentially subclassifying seizure patterns.",

abstract = "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common form of adult epilepsy involving the limbic structures of the temporal lobe. Subiculum neurons act to provide a major output from the hippocampus and consist of a large population of endogenously bursting excitatory neurons. In TLE, subiculum neurons are largely spared, become hyperexcitable and show spontaneous epileptiform activity. The basis for this hyperexcitability is unclear, but is likely to involve alterations in the expression levels and function of various ion channels. In this study, we sought to determine the importance of sodium channel currents in facilitating neuronal hyperexcitability of subiculum neurons in the continuous hippocampal stimulation (CHS) rat model of TLE. Subiculum neurons from TLE rats were hyperexcitable, firing a higher frequency of action potentials after somatic current injection and action potential (AP) bursts after synaptic stimulation. Voltage clamp recordings revealed increases in resurgent (INaR) and persistent (INaP) sodium channel currents and pro-excitatory shifts in sodium channel activation and inactivation parameters that would facilitate increases in AP generation. Attenuation of INaR and INaP currents with 4,9-anhydro-tetrodotoxin (4,9-ah TTX; 100nM), a toxin with increased potency against Nav1.6 channels, suppressed neuronal firing frequency and inhibited AP bursting induced by synaptic stimulation in TLE neurons. These findings support an important role of sodium channels, particularly Nav1.6, in facilitating subiculum neuron hyperexcitability in TLE and provide further support for the importance of INaR and INaP currents in establishing epileptiform activity of subiculum neurons.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a devastating epilepsy complication. Seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) occurs in many witnessed SUDEP patients and animal models as an initiating event leading to death. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying S-IRA will advance the development of preventive strategies against SUDEP. Serotonin (5-HT) is an important modulator for many vital functions, including respiration and arousal, and a deficiency of 5-HT signaling is strongly implicated in S-IRA in animal models, including the DBA/1 mouse. However, the brain structures that contribute to S-IRA remain elusive. We hypothesized that the dorsal raphe (DR), which sends 5-HT projections to the forebrain, is implicated in S-IRA. The present study used optogenetics in the DBA/1 mouse model of SUDEP to selectively activate 5-HT neurons in the DR. Photostimulation of DR 5-HT neurons significantly and reversibly reduced the incidence of S-IRA evoked by acoustic stimulation. Activation of 5-HT neurons in the DR suppressed tonic seizures in most DBA/1 mice without altering the seizure latency and duration of wild running and clonic seizures evoked by acoustic stimulation. This suppressant effect of photostimulation on S-IRA is independent of seizure models, as optogenetic stimulation of DR also reduced S-IRA induced by pentylenetetrazole, a proconvulsant widely used to model human generalized seizures. The S-IRA-suppressing effect of photostimulation was increased by 5-hydroxytryptophan, a chemical precursor for 5-HT synthesis, and was reversed by ondansetron, a specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, indicating that reduction of S-IRA by photostimulation of the DR is specifically mediated by enhanced 5-HT neurotransmission. Our findings suggest that deficits in 5-HT neurotransmission in the DR are implicated in S-IRA in DBA/1 mice, and that targeted intervention in the DR is potentially useful for prevention of SUDEP.",

abstract = "DEPDC5 is a newly identified epilepsy-related gene implicated in focal epilepsy, brain malformations, and Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). In vitro, DEPDC5 negatively regulates amino acid sensing by the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, but the role of DEPDC5 in neurodevelopment and epilepsy has not been described. No animal model of DEPDC5-related epilepsy has recapitulated the neurological phenotypes seen in patients, and germline knockout rodent models are embryonic lethal. Here, we establish a neuron-specific Depdc5 conditional knockout mouse by cre-recombination under the Synapsin1 promotor. Depdc5flox/flox-Syn1Cre (Depdc5cc+) mice survive to adulthood with a progressive neurologic phenotype that includes motor abnormalities (i.e., hind limb clasping) and reduced survival compared to littermate control mice. Depdc5cc+ mice have larger brains with increased cortical neuron size and dysplastic neurons throughout the cortex, comparable to the abnormal neurons seen in human focal cortical dysplasia specimens. Depdc5 results in constitutive mTORC1 hyperactivation exclusively in neurons as measured by the increased phosphorylation of the downstream ribosomal protein S6. Despite a lack of increased mTORC1 signaling within astrocytes, Depdc5cc+ brains show reactive astrogliosis. We observed two Depdc5cc+ mice to have spontaneous seizures, including a terminal seizure. We demonstrate that as a group Depdc5cc+ mice have lowered seizure thresholds, as evidenced by decreased latency to seizures after chemoconvulsant injection and increased mortality from pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. In summary, our neuron-specific Depdc5 knockout mouse model recapitulates clinical, pathological, and biochemical features of human DEPDC5-related epilepsy and brain malformations. We thereby present an important model in which to study targeted therapeutic strategies for DEPDC5-related conditions.",

Studies have shown that viral-mediated ``gene therapy'' with overexpression of NPY in the hippocampus can suppress seizures in acquired epilepsy animal models. This study investigated whether NPY gene delivery to the thalamus or somatosensory cortex, using recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV), could produce sustained seizure suppression in the GAERS model of GGE with absence seizures. Three cohorts of GAERS were injected bilaterally into the thalamus (short term n = 14 and long term n = 8) or the somatosensory cortex (n = 26) with rAAV-NPY or rAAV-empty. EEG recordings were acquired weekly post-treatment and seizure expression was quantified. Anxiety levels were tested using elevated plus maze and open field test. NPY and NPY receptor mRNA and protein expression were evaluated using quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Viral overexpression of human NPY in the thalamus and somatosensory cortex in GAERS significantly reduced the time spent in seizure activity and number of seizures, whereas seizure duration was only reduced after thalamic NPY overexpression. Human and rat NPY and rat Y2 receptor mRNA expression was significantly increased in the somatosensory cortex. NPY overexpression in the thalamus was observed in rAAV-NPY treated rats compared to controls in the long term cohort. No effect was observed on anxiety behaviour. We conclude that virally-mediated human NPY overexpression in the thalamus or somatosensory cortex produces sustained anti-epileptic effects in GAERS.

Biomarker modalities include molecular, histologic, radiographic, or physiologic characteristics. In 2015, the FDA-NIH Joint Leadership Council developed the BEST Resource (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) to improve the understanding and use of biomarker terminology in biomedical research, clinical practice, and medical product development. The BEST biomarker categories include: (a) susceptibility/risk biomarkers, (b) diagnostic biomarkers, (c) monitoring biomarkers, (d) prognostic biomarkers, (e) predictive biomarkers, (f) pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers, and (g) safety biomarkers. Here we review 30 epilepsy biomarker studies that have identified (a) diagnostic biomarkers for epilepsy, epileptogenesis, epileptogenicity, drug-refractoriness, and status epilepticus - some of the epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity biomarkers can also be considered prognostic biomarkers for the development of epilepsy in subjects with a given brain insult, (b) predictive biomarkers for epilepsy surgery outcome, and (c) a response biomarker for therapy outcome. The biomarker modalities include plasma/serum/exosomal and cerebrospinal fluid molecular biomarkers, brain tissue molecular biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, electrophysiologic biomarkers, and behavioral/cognitive biomarkers. Both single and combinatory biomarkers have been described. Most of the reviewed biomarkers have an area under the curve >0.800 in receiver operating characteristics analysis, suggesting high sensitivity and specificity. As discussed in this review, we are in the early phase of the learning curve in epilepsy biomarker discovery. Many of the seven biomarker categories lack epilepsy-related biomarkers. There is a need for epilepsy biomarker discovery using proper, statistically powered study designs with validation cohorts, and the development and use of novel analytical methods.

Phenotypic variability limits precision medicine in epilepsy, and it is important to identify factors that set phenotype severity and their mechanisms. It is not yet clear whether SCN1A mutations are necessary for the development of severe phenotypes or just for promoting seizures. A relevant example is the pleiotropic R1648H mutation that can cause either mild GEFS+ or severe DS. We used a R1648H knock-in mouse model (Scn1aRH/+) with mild/asymptomatic phenotype to dissociate the effects of seizures and of the mutation per se. The induction of short repeated seizures, at the age of disease onset for Scn1a mouse models (P21), had no effect in WT mice, but transformed the mild/asymptomatic phenotype of Scn1aRH/+ mice into a severe DS-like phenotype, including frequent spontaneous seizures and cognitive/behavioral deficits. In these mice, we found no major modifications in cytoarchitecture or neuronal death, but increased excitability of hippocampal granule cells, consistent with a pathological remodeling. Therefore, we demonstrate for our model that an SCN1A mutation is a prerequisite for a long term deleterious effect of seizures on the brain, indicating a clear interaction between seizures and the mutation for the development of a severe phenotype generated by pathological remodeling. Applied to humans, this result suggests that genetic alterations, even if mild per se, may increase the risk of second hits to develop severe phenotypes.",

Disruption of lower brainstem cardiorespiratory systems by seizures is postulated to impair respiratory and cardiac function. Here, we explore the effects of brainstem seizures and stimulation on cardiorespiratory function using a rat model of intrahippocampal 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced acute recurrent seizures. Cardiac and respiratory monitoring together with local field potential recordings from hippocampus, contralateral parietal cortex and caudal dorsomedial brainstem, were conducted in freely moving adult male Wistar rats. Seizures were induced by intrahippocampal injection of 4-AP. Increased respiratory rate but unchanged heart rate occurred during hippocampal and secondarily generalized cortical seizures. Status epilepticus without brainstem seizures increased respiratory and heart rates, whereas status epilepticus with intermittent brainstem seizures induced repeated episodes of cardiorespiratory depression leading to death. Respiratory arrest occurred prior to asystole which was the terminal event. Phenytoin (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection), administered after 4-AP intrahippocampal injection, terminated brainstem seizures and the associated cardiorespiratory depression, preventing death in five of six rats. Focal electrical stimulation of the caudal dorsomedial brainstem also suppressed cardiorespiratory rates. We conclude that in our model, brainstem seizures were associated with respiratory depression followed by cardiac arrest, and then death. We hypothesize this model shares mechanisms in common with the classic sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) syndrome associated with spontaneous seizures.",

However, the vast majority of putative disease-causing variants have not been functionally assessed for mTORC1 repression activity. Here, we develop a novel in vitro functional assay that enables rapid assessment of GATOR1-gene variants. Surprisingly, of the 17 variants tested, we show that only six showed significantly impaired mTORC1 inhibition. To further investigate variant function in vivo, we generated a conditional Depdc5 mouse which modelled a 'second-hit' mechanism of disease. Generation of Depdc5 null 'clones' in the embryonic brain resulted in mTORC1 hyperactivity and modelled epilepsy and FCD symptoms including large dysmorphic neurons, defective migration and lower seizure thresholds. Using this model, we validated DEPDC5 variant F164del to be loss-of-function. We also show that Q542P is not functionally compromised in vivo, consistent with our in vitro findings.

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality, but the precise cellular substrates involved remain elusive. Epilepsy-associated ion channel genes with co-expression in brain and heart have been proposed as SUDEP candidate genes since they provide a singular unifying link between seizures and lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Here, we generated a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse with neuron-specific deletion of Kcna1, a SUDEP-associated gene with brain-heart co-expression, to test whether seizure-evoked cardiac arrhythmias and SUDEP require the absence of Kv1.1 in both brain and heart or whether ablation in neurons is sufficient. To obtain cKO mice, we developed a floxed Kcna1 mouse which we crossed to mice with the Synapsin1-Cre transgene, which selectively deletes Kcna1 in most neurons. Molecular analyses confirmed neuron-specific Kcna1 deletion in cKO mice and corresponding loss of Kv1.1 except in cerebellum where Synapsin1-Cre is not highly expressed. Survival studies and electroencephalography, electrocardiography, and plethysmography recordings showed that cKO mice exhibit premature death, epilepsy, and cardiorespiratory dysregulation but to a lesser degree than global knockouts. Heart rate variability (HRV) was increased in cKO mice with peaks during daytime suggesting disturbed diurnal HRV patterns as a SUDEP biomarker. Residual Kv1.1 expression in cKO cerebellum suggests it may play an unexpected role in regulating ictal cardiorespiratory dysfunction and SUDEP risk. This work demonstrates the principle that channelopathies with brain-heart expression patterns can increase death risk by brain-driven mechanisms alone without a functionally compromised heart, reinforcing seizure control as a primary clinical strategy for SUDEP prevention.",

abstract = "DEP-domain containing 5 (DEPDC5) is part of the GATOR1 complex that functions as key inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Loss-of-function mutations in DEPDC5 leading to mTOR hyperactivation have been identified as the most common cause of either lesional or non-lesional focal epilepsy. However, the precise mechanisms by which DEPDC5 loss-of-function triggers neuronal and network hyperexcitability are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the cellular mechanisms of hyperexcitability by comparing the constitutive heterozygous Depdc5 knockout mouse versus different levels of acute Depdc5 deletion ($\approx$40\% and $\approx$80\% neuronal knockdown of Depdc5 protein) by RNA interference in primary cortical cultures. While heterozygous Depdc5+/- neurons have only a subtle phenotype, acutely knocked-down neurons exhibit a strong dose-dependent phenotype characterized by mTOR hyperactivation, increased soma size, dendritic arborization, excitatory synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability. The robust synaptic phenotype resulting from the acute knockdown Depdc5 deficiency highlights the importance of the temporal dynamics of Depdc5 knockdown in triggering the phenotypic changes, reminiscent of the somatic second-hit mechanism in patients with focal cortical dysplasia. These findings uncover a novel synaptic phenotype that is causally linked to Depdc5 knockdown, highlighting the developmental role of Depdc5. Interestingly, the synaptic defect appears to affect only excitatory synapses, while inhibitory synapses develop normally. The increased frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs, paralleled by increased density of excitatory synapses and expression of glutamate receptors, may generate an excitation/inhibition imbalance that triggers epileptogenesis.",

We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from epilepsy patients harboring heterozygous loss of function mutations in DEPDC5. Patient iPSCs displayed increases in both phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and proliferation rate, consistent with elevated mTORC1 activation. In line with these findings, we observed increased soma size in patient iPSC-derived cortical neurons that was rescued with rapamycin treatment. These data indicate that human cells heterozygous for DEPDC5 loss-of-function mutations are haploinsufficient for control of mTORC1 signaling.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To examine autonomic regulation of core body temperature, heart rate (HR), and breathing rate (BR) in response to moderately elevated ambient temperature or moderate physical exercise in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome (DS). METHODS: We studied video-EEG, ECG, respiration, and temperature in mice with global heterozygous Scn1a knockout (KO) (DS mice), interneuron specific Scn1a KO, and wildtype (WT) mice during exposure to increased environmental temperature and moderate treadmill exercise. RESULTS: Core body temperatures of WT and DS mice were similar during baseline. After 15 mins of heat exposure, the peak value was lower in DS than WT mice. In the following mins of heat exposure, the temperature slowly returned close to baseline level in WT, whereas it remained elevated in DS mice. KO of Scn1a in GABAergic neurons caused similar thermoregulatory deficits in mice. During exercise, the HR increase was less prominent in DS than WT mice. After exercise, the HR was significantly more suppressed in DS. The heart rate variability (HRV) was lower in DS than WT mice during baseline and higher in DS during exercise-recovery periods. SIGNIFICANCE: We found novel abnormalities that expand the spectrum of interictal, ictal, and postictal autonomic dysregulation in DS mice. During mild heat stress, there was a significantly blunted correction of body temperature, and a less suppression of both HR and respiration rate in DS than WT mice. These effects were seen in mice with selective KO of Scn1A in GABAergic neurons. During exercise stress, there was diminished increase in HR, followed by an exaggerated HR suppression and HRV elevation during recovery in DS mice compared to controls. These findings suggest that different environmental stressors can uncover distinct autonomic disturbances in DS mice. Interneurons play an important role in thermoregulation. Understanding the spectrum and mechanisms of autonomic disorders in DS may help develop more effective strategies to prevent seizures and SUDEP.",

The ketogenic diet (KD) has demonstrated efficacy as a metabolic treatment for intractable epilepsy and other disorders but its effect on local brain oxygen levels is completely unknown. This study investigated the effects of the KD on tissue oxygenation in the hippocampus before and after electrically elicited (kindled) seizures and whether it could protect against a seizure-induced learning impairment. We also examined the effects of the ketone $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as a potential underlying mechanism. METHODS: Male and female rats were given access to one of three diet protocols 2 weeks prior to the initiation of seizures: KD, caloric restricted standard chow, and ad libitum standard chow. Dorsal hippocampal oxygen levels were measured prior to initiation of diets as well as before and after a 10-day kindling paradigm. Male rats were then tested on a novel object recognition task to assess postictal learning impairments. In a separate cohort, BHB was administered 30 min prior to seizure elicitation to determine whether it influenced oxygen dynamics. RESULTS: The KD increased dorsal hippocampal oxygen levels, ameliorated postictal hypoxia, and prevented postictal learning impairments. Acute BHB administration did not alter oxygen levels before or after seizures. INTERPRETATION: The ketogenic diet raised brain oxygen levels and attenuated severe postictal hypoxia likely through a mechanism independent of ketosis and shows promise as a non-pharmacological treatment to prevent the postictal state.",

Elevated levels for IL-1ra, IL-1$\beta$, IL-6 and CXCL8/IL-8 were reported in several different epilepsy etiologies and media, while other proteins were specifically increased for one etiology. IL-1$\alpha$, IL-7 and IL-13, as well as the chemokines CCL2-5, -19 and -22, were increased exclusively in brain tissue.

Epilepsy is characterized by the presence of spontaneous recurrent seizures as a result of sudden and abnormal electrical activity in specific areas of the cerebral cortex. However, this condition encompasses much more than simply the presence of seizures. Cognitive problems and behavioral impairments are also frequent actors, as well as mood disorders. These must be precisely described in order to develop more successful pharmacological, or even behavioral, treatments. We review some of the fundamental behavioral experimental rodent protocols that have recently been applied to the study of behavioral impairments in epilepsy, particularly in epilepsy modeled by different chemoconvulsants, such as pilocarpine or kainic acid. These experimental protocols are classified into two categories: Tests designed for studying emotional factors, and those designed for studying cognitive impairments and social behavior. Behavioral impairments and adaptations identified by the use of these procedures are described.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent form of focal epilepsy. TLE is associated with cardio-autonomic dysfunction and increased cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients over the fifth decade of age. In these subjects, TLE can be classified as early-onset (EOTLE; i.e., patients who had developed epilepsy in their youth) and late-onset (LOTLE; i.e., patients who developed epilepsy in adulthood). Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is useful for assessing cardio-autonomic function and identifying patients with increased CV risk. This study compared changes in HRV occurring in patients over the age of 50, with EOTLE or LOTLE. METHODS: We enrolled twenty-seven adults with LOTLE and 23 with EOTLE. Each patient underwent a EEG and EKG recording during 20-minutes of resting state and a 5-minutes hyperventilation (HV). Short-term HRV analysis was performed both in time and frequency domains. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) were used to analyze HRV parameters according to the condition (baseline and HV) and group (LOTLE and EOTLE groups). RESULTS: Compared to the LOTLE group, the EOTLE group showed significantly decreased LnRMSSD (natural logarithm of the root mean square of the difference between contiguous RR intervals) (p-value=0.05), LnHF ms2 (natural logarithm of high frequency absolute power) (p-value=0.05), HF n.u. (high frequency power expressed in normalized units) (p-value=0.008) and HF\% (high frequency power expressed in percentage) (p-value=0.01). In addition, EOTLE patients exhibited increased LF n.u.

During HV, the LOTLE group exhibited a multiplicative effect for the interaction between group and condition with increased LF n.u. (p = 0.003) and LF\% (low frequency expressed in percentage) (p = 0.05) values. CONCLUSIONS: EOTLE is associated with reduced vagal tone compared to LOTLE.

abstract = "A growing body of evidence suggests that stress triggers a variety of pathophysiological responses. Recent studies show that stress produces enduring effects on structure and function of hippocampus, which is one of the most important structures involved in epilepsy. In the present study, we determined the effect of repeated restraint stress exposure on the susceptibility of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures and the possible mechanisms involved using a rodent model. Our results show that mice subjected to repeated restraint stress exhibited shorter latency to PTZ-induced tonic-clonic seizures and higher seizure severity, suggesting chronic restraint stress increases seizure susceptibility. Following repeated restraint stress, we observed an increased level of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as well as oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Moreover, our results show that chronic restraint stress exposure causes neuron loss in the hippocampus. Inhibition of ER stress with chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), however, protects against chronic restraint stress-induced neuron loss, suggesting repeated restraint stress-induced neuronal degeneration is dependent on ER stress activation. On the other hand, inhibition of ER stress with TUDCA suppresses restraint stress-induced seizure susceptibility. Taken together, these results indicate that repeated restraint stress increases seizure susceptibility by activation of hippocampal ER stress and ER stress mediated oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Thus, attenuating ER stress may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy targeted to block stress-induced seizure activities.",

abstract = "Status epilepticus (SE) is a major medical emergency associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the mechanisms that terminate seizure activity and prevent the development of status epilepticus. Cannabinoids possess anticonvulsant properties and the endocannabinoid system has been implicated in regulating seizure duration and frequency. Endocannabinoids regulate synaptic transmission and dampen seizure activity via activation of the presynaptic cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). This study was initiated to evaluate the role of CB1 receptor-dependent endocannabinoid synaptic transmission towards preventing the development of status epilepticus-like activity in the well-characterized hippocampal neuronal culture model of acquired epilepsy using patch clamp electrophysiology. Application of the CB1 receptor antagonists SR141716A (1 microM) or AM251 (1 microM) to ``epileptic'' neurons caused the development of continuous epileptiform activity, resembling electrographic status epilepticus. The induction of status epilepticus-like activity by CB1 receptor antagonists was reversible and could be overcome by maximal concentrations of CB1 agonists. Similar treatment of control neurons with CB1 receptor antagonists did not produce status epilepticus or hyperexcitability. These findings suggest that CB1 receptor-dependent endocannabinoid endogenous tone plays an important role in modulating seizure frequency and duration and preventing the development of status epilepticus-like activity in populations of epileptic neurons. The regulation of seizure activity and prevention of status epilepticus by the endocannabinoid system offers an important insight into understanding the basic mechanisms that control the development of continuous epileptiform discharges.",

These ectopic granule cells (EGCs) demonstrate regular bursts of action potentials that are synchronized with CA3 pyramidal cell burst discharges and the bursts of hilar neurons, including mossy cells. Such findings suggest that mossy cells may participate in circuits that activate EGCs. Electron microscopic immunolabeling was therefore used to determine if mossy cell axon terminals form synapses with hilar EGC dendrites, using animals that underwent pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Pilocarpine was administered to adult male rats, and those which developed status epilepticus were perfused 5-7 months later, after the period of EGC genesis. Hippocampal sections were processed for dual electron microscopic immunolabeling (using calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) as a marker for mossy cells and calbindin (CaBP) as a marker for EGCs). Light microscopic analysis revealed large CGRP-immunoreactive cells in the hilus, with the appearance and distribution of mossy cells. Electron microscopic analysis revealed numerous CaBP-immunoreactive dendrites in the hilus, some of which were innervated by CGRP-immunoreactive terminals. The results suggest that mossy cells participate in the excitatory circuits which activate EGCs, providing further insight into the network rearrangements that accompany seizure-induced neurogenesis in this animal model of epilepsy.",

author = "van Luijtelaar, Gilles",
abstract = "Comorbidity in the affective domain seems rather typical for idiopathic epilepsy. Whether seizures are causative for the behavioral abnormalities or whether they are a common genetic cause remains to be established. Although the most proper control groups are not always available, there seems to be some consistency in the behavioral patterns seen in rats with absence epilepsy. Formal behavioral testing has shown that genetic absence models such as WAG/Rij's and GAERS, but also other rat lines endowed with spontaneous occurring spike-wave discharges (APO-SUS and Long-Evans rats), show all signs of depression-like behavior, while some lines show an even more complex affective comorbidity. The availability of a treatment that prevents both the neurodevelopment of the genetically programmed seizure and the comorbid symptomatology may help in answering whether seizures are causative for or epiphenomena of changes in affective behavior. If absence seizures and depressive-like behavior is indeed caused by the same underlying factors, then it is predicted that preventing environmental stress in absence epileptic rats will also prevent the affective disturbances.",

We found that CRF gene expression was up-regulated significantly at 2 h during and 1 d after PISE in comparison to control mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the number of CRF and Fos immunoreactive cells was increased significantly in the strata oriens and pyramidale of CA1 area and in the stratum pyramidale of CA3 area at 2 h during and 1 d after PISE. CRF was induced in calbindin (CB) or calretinin (CR) immunoreactive interneurons in stratum oriens at 2 h during PISE. It suggests that induced CRF may be related to the over excitation of hippocampal neurons and occurrence of status epilepticus. It may also cause excitoneurotoxicity and delayed loss of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons, leading to the onset of epilepsy.",

abstract = "We previously reported that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) increased neuronal excitability specifically in type II neurons of the dorsolateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dlBNST). Because the majority of type II dlBNST neurons are thought to be GABAergic interneurons, at least a portion of which are considered to regulate type III dlBNST neurons, it is possible that CRF increases inhibitory input to type III neurons through the activation of type II neurons in the dlBNST. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of CRF on type III dlBNST neurons using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from rat BNST slices in the presence of kynurenic acid. Spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) and miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were recorded in the absence and presence of tetrodotoxin, respectively. Bath application of CRF significantly increased the frequency of sIPSCs, indicating that CRF enhances the inhibitory input to type III neurons. CRF application failed to increase the frequency of mIPSCs, suggesting that CRF-induced increases in sIPSCs are dependent on action potentials. Combined with our previous finding that CRF specifically depolarizes type II dlBNST neurons, these results suggest that CRF may attenuate type III neuron excitation by augmenting the inhibitory influence of type II neurons in the dlBNST.",

abstract = "In pregnancy and the postpartum period, many women have emotional instability and some suffer from depression. The ovarian steroid hormone milieu is markedly changed during these periods, and this hormonal change may be an important cause of peripartum emotional instability. The amygdala is a central region of emotion, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), which is considered to be the extended amygdala, is also involved in the emotional response. The amygdala and BNST are well characterized as target brain regions for ovarian steroid hormones, and this suggests that the functional response of neurons in these regions to hormonal fluctuation is affected in the peripartum period. In this study, we investigated the neuronal morphology in the central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) nucleus of the amygdala and BNST on gestational days 15 (G15) (mid-gestation) and 20 (G20) (late gestation) and 4days after delivery (P4) (early postpartum) in rat. Golgi staining showed that the dendritic spine density, and particularly the number of mature mushroom-type spines, in the CeA, BLA and BNST was significantly decreased at P4, compared with G15 and G20 and with virgin females in the estrous phase in the normal estrous cycle (Est). Interestingly, the presence of pups after delivery influenced the spine density in the BNST. The density was significantly decreased with pup presence compared with pup absence at P4, and compared with G15, G20 and Est. These results provide fundamental insights into the neuronal basis underlying emotional instability during pregnancy and postpartum.",

Accordingly, we aimed to establish an electrical kindling model in autonomic-mediating areas of the insular cortex, and to conduct a long-term observation of epileptic genesis in these animals until sudden unexpected death. To establish this model in adult rats, we implanted stimulation electrodes in the granular cell layer of the insular cortex, which controls the heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR). Subsequently, seizure was induced successfully in 92.3\% of the rats, and typical autonomic changes were observed during these seizures. Interestingly, the model was established more easily in older rats, and the rats in which electrical stimulation led to a greater reduction in the HR. Moreover, death occurred in 25\% of the kindled rats. In conclusion, our kindling model demonstrates the ability of insular cortex stimulation to generate epilepsy. Our model thus offers a practical tool for studies of the role of the insular cortex in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",

abstract = "Stress is a common seizure trigger in persons with epilepsy. The body's physiological response to stress is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and involves a hormonal cascade that includes corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropin releasing hormone (ACTH) and the release of cortisol (in humans and primates) or corticosterone (in rodents). The prolonged exposure to stress hormones may not only exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions including epilepsy, but may also increase the predisposition to psychiatric comorbidities. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis negatively impacts the structure and function of the temporal lobe of the brain, a region that is heavily involved in epilepsy and mood disorders like anxiety and depression. Seizures themselves damage temporal lobe structures, further disinhibiting the HPA axis, setting off a vicious cycle of neuronal damage and increasing susceptibility for subsequent seizures and psychiatric comorbidity. Treatments targeting the HPA axis may be beneficial both for epilepsy and for associated stress-related comorbidities such as anxiety or depression. This paper will highlight the evidence demonstrating dysfunction in the HPA axis associated with epilepsy which may contribute to the comorbidity of psychiatric disorders and epilepsy, and propose treatment strategies that may dually improve seizure control as well as alleviate stress related psychiatric comorbidities.",

The quality of systematic reviews was validated using the AMSTAR tool and articles were reviewed by two referees. A total of 16,958 articles went through stage one review of abstracts and titles. A total of 76 articles on genetic and non-genetic risk factors for the onset and progression of epilepsy met the eligibility criteria for data extraction. Dozens of risk factors were significantly associated with onset of epilepsy. Inconsistent levels of evidence for risk of onset included family history of epilepsy, history of febrile seizures, alcohol consumption, CNS and other infections, brain trauma, head injury, perinatal stroke, preterm birth and three genetic markers. Limited evidence showed that symptomatic epilepsy, focal seizures/syndromes, slow waves on EEG, higher seizure frequency, high stress or anxiety, and lack of sleep decreased the odds of seizure remission.

The structural changes underlying this memory impairment have not been demonstrated previously with tractography. METHODS: We performed a tractography analysis of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging scans in 18 patients with unilateral TLE undergoing presurgical evaluation, and in 10 healthy controls. A seed region in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus was selected from which to trace the white matter connections of the medial temporal lobe. A correlation analysis was carried out between volume and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) of the connections, and pre-operative material specific memory performance. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the left and right sided connections in controls. In the left TLE patients, the connected regions ipsilateral to the epileptogenic region were found to be significantly reduced in volume and mean FA compared with the contralateral region, and left-sided connections in control subjects. Significant correlations were found in left TLE patients between left and right FA, and verbal and non-verbal memory respectively. CONCLUSION: Tractography demonstrated the alteration of white matter pathways that may underlie impaired memory function in TLE. A detailed knowledge of the integrity of these connections may be useful in predicting memory decline in chronic temporal lobe epilepsy.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Imaging studies of epilepsy patients with comorbid affective disturbance demonstrate morphometric changes in limbic brain regions implicated in psychiatric disease. Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), specifically bred for their epilepsy phenotype, also exhibit elevated anxiety-like behaviors suggesting a common causality. Here we examined whether relevant cerebral morphological alterations exist in this rat strain using volumetric measurements and large deformation high dimensional mapping (HDM-LD), a tool recently validated to produce accurate three-dimensional surface representations of the hippocampus. METHODS: Volumetric MRI and the Open Field test of anxiety were performed in adult female GAERS (n=12) and Non-Epileptic Controls (NEC; n=11). The volumes of selected brain regions, including cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and lateral ventricles, were measured using Region-Of-Interest analysis from the MRI data and total volumes compared between the two strains. RESULTS: GAERS had increased amygdala (right: p=0.003; left p<0.001), cortices (right: p=0.006; left p=0.012) and ventricular volumes (p=0.002) when compared with NEC rats. Further, HDM-LD showed GAERS to have hippocampal volume loss in two regions: the medial hippocampal surface immediately caudal to the hippocampal commissure, and the lateral hippocampal surface over the mid-portion of the septotemporal axis. GAERS exhibited increased anxiety in the Open Field compared with NEC rats: reduced distance traveled (p<0.001) and reduced time in the centre area (p=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Morphometric brain changes in GAERS could be relevant to their hyperanxious and epileptic phenotypes. This model may be useful in illuminating the pathogenesis of affective disorders generally, as well as modeling psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Absence epilepsy is a common seizure disorder in children which can produce chronic psychosocial sequelae. Human patients and rat absence models show bilateral spike-wave discharges (SWD) in cortical regions. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in rat absence models to detect abnormalities in white matter pathways connecting regions of seizure activity. METHODS: We studied Wistar albino Glaxo rats of Rijswijk (WAG/Rij), genetic absence epilepsy rats of Strasbourg (GAERS), and corresponding nonepileptic control strains. Ex vivo DTI was performed at 9.4 T with diffusion gradients applied in 16 orientations. We compared fractional anisotropy (FA), perpendicular (lambda(perpendicular)) and parallel (lambda(||)) diffusivity between groups using t-maps and region of interest (ROI) measurements. RESULTS: Adult epileptic WAG/Rij rats exhibited a localized decrease in FA in the anterior corpus callosum. This area was confirmed by tractography to interconnect somatosensory cortex regions most intensely involved in seizures. This FA decrease was not present in young WAG/Rij rats before onset of SWD. GAERS, which have more severe SWD than WAG/Rij, exhibited even more pronounced callosal FA decreases. Reduced FA in the epileptic animals originated from an increased lambda(perpendicular) with no significant changes in lambda(||). INTERPRETATION: Reduced FA with increased lambda(perpendicular) suggests that chronic seizures cause reduction in myelin or decreased axon fiber density in white matter pathways connecting regions of seizure activity. These DTI abnormalities may improve the understanding of chronic neurological difficulties in children suffering with absence epilepsy, and may also serve as a noninvasive biomarker for monitoring beneficial effects of treatment.",

Emerging evidence suggests the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediates both anxiety and addiction through connections with other brain regions, including the amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Although BNST structural connections have been identified in rodents and a limited number of structural connections have been verified in non-human primates, BNST connections have yet to be described in humans. Neuroimaging is a powerful tool for identifying structural and functional circuits in vivo. In this study, we examined BNST structural and functional connectivity in a large sample of humans. The BNST showed structural and functional connections with multiple subcortical regions, including limbic, thalamic, and basal ganglia structures, confirming structural findings in rodents. We describe two novel connections in the human brain that have not been previously reported in rodents or non-human primates, including a structural connection with the temporal pole, and a functional connection with the paracingulate gyrus. The findings of this study provide a map of the BNST's structural and functional connectivity across the brain in healthy humans. In large part, the BNST neurocircuitry in humans is similar to the findings from rodents and non-human primates; however, several connections are unique to humans. Future explorations of BNST neurocircuitry in anxiety and addiction disorders have the potential to reveal novel mechanisms underlying these disabling psychiatric illnesses.",

abstract = "Our knowledge on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis has evolved towards the view that this syndrome affects widespread brain networks. Diffusion weighted imaging studies have shown alterations of large white matter tracts, most notably in left temporal lobe epilepsy, but the degree of altered connections between cortical and subcortical structures remains to be clarified. We performed a whole brain connectome analysis in 39 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (20 right and 19 left) and 28 healthy subjects. We performed whole-brain probabilistic fiber tracking using MRtrix and segmented 164 cortical and subcortical structures with Freesurfer. Individual structural connectivity graphs based on these 164 nodes were computed by mapping the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) onto each tract. Connectomes were then compared using two complementary methods: permutation tests for pair-wise connections and Network Based Statistics to probe for differences in large network components. Comparison of pair-wise connections revealed a marked reduction of connectivity between left TLE patients and controls, which was strongly lateralized to the ipsilateral temporal lobe. Specifically, infero-lateral cortex and temporal pole were strongly affected, and so was the perisylvian cortex. In contrast, for right TLE, focal connectivity loss was much less pronounced and restricted to bilateral limbic structures and right temporal cortex. Analysis of large network components revealed furthermore that both left and right hippocampal sclerosis affected diffuse global and interhemispheric connectivity. Thus, left temporal lobe epilepsy was associated with a much more pronounced pattern of reduced FA, that included major landmarks of perisylvian language circuitry. These distinct patterns of connectivity associated with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis show how a focal pathology influences global network architecture, and how left or right-sided lesions may have differential and specific impacts on cerebral connectivity.",

Here we report on the development of a reliable manual segmentation protocol performed on 3T MRI images using a scanning sequence that provides high gray matter/white matter/cerebrospinal fluid contrast. Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities, measured in 10 healthy individuals, demonstrate that the protocol can be reliably implemented (intra-rater Dice similarity coefficient$\geq$0.85, inter-rater$\geq$0.77).

These structures have overlapping anatomical projections to downstream targets that initiate defensive responses. Despite these commonalities, researchers have also proposed a functional dissociation between the CeA and BNST, with the CeA promoting responses to discrete stimuli and the BNST promoting responses to diffuse threat. Intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) provides a means to investigate the functional architecture of the brain, unbiased by task demands. Using ultra-high field neuroimaging (7-Tesla fMRI), which provides increased spatial resolution, this study compared the iFC networks of the CeA and BNST in 27 healthy individuals. Both structures were coupled with areas of the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray matter. Compared to the BNST, the bilateral CeA was more strongly coupled with the insula and regions that support sensory processing, including thalamus and fusiform gyrus. In contrast, the bilateral BNST was more strongly coupled with regions involved in cognitive and motivational processes, including the dorsal paracingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and striatum. Collectively, these findings suggest that responses to sensory stimulation are preferentially coordinated by the CeA and cognitive and motivational responses are preferentially coordinated by the BNST.",

Additionally how novelty, stimulus negativity and trait anxiety interact to affect activity in these areas is also unclear. To address these questions, we presented participants with novel and repeated, fearful and neutral faces, while measuring brain activity via fMRI, and also assessed participants' self-reported trait anxiety. As the small size of the BNST makes assessing its activity at typical fMRI resolution difficult, we employed high resolution 7 T scanning. Our results replicate findings of novelty sensitivity that is independent of valence in the hippocampus. Our results also provide novel evidence for a BNST novelty response toward neutral, but not fearful faces. We also found that the novelty response in the hippocampus and BNST was blunted in participants with high trait anxiety. Additionally, we found left amygdala sensitivity to stimulus negativity that was blunted for high trait anxiety participants. These findings extend past research on the response to novel stimuli in the hippocampus and amygdala at high resolution, and are the first to demonstrate trait anxiety modulated novelty sensitivity in the BNST that is dependent on stimulus valence.",

Specifically, we functionally identified the human homologue of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the primary premotor sympathetic nucleus in the medulla responsible for generating sympathetic vasoconstrictor drive. By performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain at the same time as recording muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), via a microlectrode inserted into the common peroneal nerve, we are able to identify areas of the brain involved in the generation of sympathetic outflow to the muscle vascular bed, a major contributor to blood pressure regulation. Together with functional connectivity analysis of areas identified through MSNA-coupled fMRI, we have established key components of the human sympathetic connectome and their roles in the control of blood pressure. Whilst our studies confirm the role of lower brainstem regions such as the NTS, CVLM and RVLM in baroreflex control of MSNA, our findings indicate that the insula - hypothalamus - PAG - RVLM circuitry is tightly coupled to MSNA at rest. This fits with data obtained from experimental animals, but also emphasizes the role of areas above the brainstem in the regulation of blood pressure.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are hypothesized to be the output nodes of the extended amygdala threat response, integrating multiple signals to coordinate the threat response via outputs to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The BNST and CeA are structurally and functionally connected, suggesting interactions between these regions may regulate how the response to provocation unfolds. However, the relationship between human BNST-CeA connectivity and the behavioral response to affective stimuli is little understood. To investigate whether individual differences in BNST-CeA connectivity are related to the affective response to negatively valenced stimuli, we tested relations between resting-state BNST-CeA connectivity and both facial electromyographic (EMG) activity of the corrugator supercilii muscle and eyeblink startle magnitude during affective image presentation within the Refresher sample of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. We found that higher right BNST-CeA connectivity was associated with greater corrugator activity to negative, but not positive, images. There was a trend-level association between right BNST-CeA connectivity and trait negative affect. Eyeblink startle magnitude was not significantly related to BNST-CeA connectivity. These results suggest that functional interactions between BNST and CeA contribute to the behavioral response to negative emotional events.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is emerging as a critical region in multiple psychiatric disorders including anxiety, PTSD, and alcohol and substance use disorders. In conjunction with growing knowledge of the BNST, an increasing number of studies examine connections of the BNST and how those connections impact BNST function. The importance of this BNST network is highlighted by rodent studies demonstrating that projections from other brain regions regulate BNST activity and influence BNST-related behavior. While many animal and human studies replicate the components of the BNST network, to date, structural connections between the BNST and insula have only been described in rodents and have yet to be shown in humans. In this study, we used probabilistic tractography to examine BNST-insula structural connectivity in humans. We used two methods of dividing the insula: 1) anterior and posterior insula, to be consistent with much of the existing insula literature; and 2) eight subregions that represent informative cytoarchitectural divisions. We found evidence of a BNST-insula structural connection in humans, with the strongest BNST connectivity localized to the anteroventral insula, a region of agranular cortex. BNST-insula connectivity differed by hemisphere and was moderated by sex. These results translate rodent findings to humans and lay an important foundation for future studies examining the role of BNST-insula pathways in psychiatric disorders.",

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a recently developed MRI technique that can measure macroscopic axonal organization in nervous system tissues. In this article, the principles of DTI methodologies are explained, and several applications introduced, including visualization of axonal tracts in myelin and axonal injuries as well as human brain and mouse embryonic development.

While the presence of abnormal DGCs in epilepsy has been known for decades, direct evidence linking abnormal DGCs to seizures has been lacking. Here, we isolate the effects of abnormal DGCs using a transgenic mouse model to selectively delete PTEN from postnatally generated DGCs. PTEN deletion led to hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway, producing abnormal DGCs morphologically similar to those in epilepsy. Strikingly, animals in which PTEN was deleted from $\geq$ 9\% of the DGC population developed spontaneous seizures in about 4 weeks, confirming that abnormal DGCs, which are present in both animals and humans with epilepsy, are capable of causing the disease.",

SENP2 is highly enriched in the hippocampus, often the focus of epileptic seizures. SENP2 deficiency results in hyper-SUMOylation of multiple potassium channels known to regulate neuronal excitability. We demonstrate that the depolarizing M-current conducted by Kv7 channel is significantly diminished in SENP2-deficient hippocampal CA3 neurons, primarily responsible for neuronal hyperexcitability. Following seizures, SENP2-deficient mice develop atrioventricular conduction blocks and cardiac asystole.

We found that loss of Scn8a leads to altered RT cell intrinsic excitability and a failure in recurrent RT synaptic inhibition. We propose that these deficits cooperate to enhance thalamocortical network synchrony and generate pathological oscillations. To our knowledge, this finding is the first clear demonstration of a pathological state tied to disruption of the RT-RT synapse. Our observation that loss of a single gene in the thalamus of an adult wild-type animal is sufficient to cause spike-wave discharges is striking and represents an example of absence epilepsy of thalamic origin.",

MCs also synapse with GABAergic interneurons that mediate feed-forward inhibition onto GCs. Surprisingly, although these circuits have been implicated in both memory formation (e.g., pattern separation) and temporal lobe epilepsy, little is known about activity-dependent plasticity of their synaptic connections. Here, we report that MC-GC synapses undergo a presynaptic, NMDA-receptor-independent form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that requires postsynaptic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB and presynaptic cyclic AMP (cAMP)/PKA signaling. This LTP is input specific and selectively expressed at MC-GC synapses, but not at the disynaptic inhibitory loop. By increasing the excitation/inhibition balance, MC-GC LTP enhances GC output at the associative MC-GC recurrent circuit and may contribute to dentate-dependent forms of learning and epilepsy.",

We identified calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) as sufficient and necessary for establishing a conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Photoactivating projections from CGRPPBN neurons to either the central nucleus of the amygdala or the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis can also induce robust CTA. CGRPPBN neurons undergo plasticity following CTA, and inactivation of either Arc or Grin1 (genes involved in memory consolidation) prevents establishment of a strong CTA. Calcium imaging reveals that the novel food re-activates CGRPPBN neurons after conditioning. Inhibition of these neurons or inactivation of the Grin1 gene after conditioning attenuates CTA expression. Our results indicate that CGRPPBN neurons not only play a key role for learning food aversions but also contribute to the maintenance and expression of those memories.",

LC neurons co-released noradrenaline and glutamate to excite PBN neurons and suppress feeding. LC neurons also suppressed inhibitory input to PBN neurons by inducing heterosynaptic, endocannabinoid-dependent, long-term depression of CeA synapses. Blocking or knocking down endocannabinoid receptors in CeA neurons prevented fear-induced depression of CeA synaptic transmission and fear-induced suppression of feeding.

abstract = "Compared to the other glutamate receptors, progress in the understanding of the functions of kainate receptors (KARs) has lagged behind, due mainly to the relative lack of specific pharmacological tools. Over the last decade subunit selective agonists (e.g. ATPA and 5-iodowillardiine) and orthosteric (e.g. LY382884 and ACET) and allosteric antagonists for KARs that contain GluK1 (GluR5) subunits have been developed. However, no selective ligands for the other KAR subunits have been identified. The use of GluK1 antagonists has enabled several functions of KARs, that contain this subunit, to be identified. Thus, KARs have been shown to regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. In the case of the regulation of l-glutamate release, they can function as facilitatory autoreceptors or inhibitory autoreceptors during repetitive synaptic activation and can respond to ambient levels of l-glutamate to provide a tonic regulation of l-glutamate release. KARs also contribute a component of excitatory synaptic transmission at certain synapses. They can also act as triggers for both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) and rapid alterations in their trafficking can result in altered synaptic transmission during both synaptic plasticity and neuronal development. KARs also contribute to synchronised rhythmic activity in the brain and are involved in forms of learning and memory. With respect to therapeutic indications, antagonists for GluK1 have shown positive activity in animal models of pain, migraine, epilepsy, stroke and anxiety. This potential has now been confirmed in dental pain and migraine in initial studies in man.",

Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult rats by lithium and pilocarpine. Carisbamate (30, 60, 90, and 120 mg/kg) was injected at 1 and 9 h after SE onset and continued twice daily for 6 additional days. The reference groups received diazepam instead of carisbamate. Neuroprotection was assessed during the first 24 h of SE with Fluoro-Jade B and after 14 days with thionine staining. SE severity and epileptic outcome were assessed by video, and surface and depth electroencephalographic recordings. At the two highest doses, carisbamate treatment reduced SE severity; produced strong neuroprotection of hippocampus, ventral cortices, thalamus, and amygdala; prevented mossy fiber sprouting in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; and delayed or suppressed the occurrence of spontaneous motor seizures. Rats with no spontaneous motor seizures displayed spike-and-wave discharges that share all the characteristics of absence seizures. In conclusion, carisbamate is able to induce strong neuroprotection and affect the nature of epileptogenic events occurring during and after lithium-pilocarpine status epilepticus, reflecting marked insult- and disease-modifying effects.",

Previous reports indicated a downregulation of group III mGluRs at the lateral perforant path-granule cell synapse in the chronically epileptic hippocampus.

The specific group II mGluR agonist (2S,2′R,3′R)-2-(2′,3′-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV, 10 $\mu$M) significantly depressed medial perforant path-evoked responses in control slices, but significantly more so in epileptic tissue. This depression was accompanied by a significant increase of the paired-pulse ratio in both animal groups indicating a presynaptic mechanism. Moreover, we also found that this significantly enhanced DCG-IV effect in the medial perforant path recorded in slices from pilocarpine-treated rats was due to a significant increase of mGluR2, but not mGluR3 transcripts in the entorhinal cortex using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the increased expression of group II mGluRs in the epileptic medial molecular layer. These results demonstrate that chronic epilepsy not only causes downregulation of mGluRs in the hippocampus, but may also lead to enhanced expression of these receptors -- at least in the medial perforant path.",

author = "Sloviter, Robert S and Bumanglag, Argyle V",
abstract = "The ``latent period'' between brain injury and clinical epilepsy is widely regarded to be a seizure-free, pre-epileptic state during which a time-consuming cascade of molecular events and structural changes gradually mediates the process of ``epileptogenesis.'' The concept of the ``latent period'' as the duration of ``epileptogenesis'' implies that epilepsy is not an immediate result of brain injury, and that anti-epileptogenic strategies need to target delayed secondary mechanisms that develop sometime after an initial injury. However, depth recordings made directly from the dentate granule cell layers in awake rats after convulsive status epilepticus-induced injury have now shown that whenever perforant pathway stimulation-induced status epilepticus produces extensive hilar neuron loss and entorhinal cortical injury, hyperexcitable granule cells immediately generate spontaneous epileptiform discharges and focal or generalized behavioral seizures. This indicates that hippocampal injury caused by convulsive status epilepticus is immediately epileptogenic and that hippocampal epileptogenesis requires no delayed secondary mechanism. When latent periods do exist after injury, we hypothesize that less extensive cell loss causes an extended period during which initially subclinical focal seizures gradually increase in duration to produce the first clinical seizure. Thus, the ``latent period'' is suggested to be a state of ``epileptic maturation,'' rather than a prolonged period of ``epileptogenesis,'' and therefore the antiepileptogenic therapeutic window may only remain open during the first week after injury, when some delayed cell death may still be preventable. Following the perhaps unavoidable development of the first focal seizures (``epileptogenesis''), the most fruitful therapeutic strategy may be to interrupt the process of ``epileptic maturation,'' thereby keeping focal seizures focal.

Mutations in HCN channels have also been associated with idiopathic epilepsies such as GEFS+. In addition, HCN channel expression and function are modulated during symptomatic epilepsies such as temporal lobe epilepsy. It is, though, unclear as to whether the changes in HCN channel expression and function associated with the various forms of epilepsy promote epileptogenesis or are adaptive.

abstract = "The intricate relationships that associate pain, stress responses and emotional behavior have been well established. Acute stressful situations can decrease nociceptive sensations and conversely, chronic pain can enhance other pain experiences and heighten the emotional and behavioral consequences of stress. Accordingly, chronic pain is comorbid with a number of behavioral disorders including depression, anxiety abnormalities and associated stress-related disorders including post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) represents a convergence of pathways for pain, stress and emotion, and we have identified pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) immunoreactivity in fiber elements in the lateral capsular division of the CeA (CeLC). The PACAP staining patterns colocalized in part with those for calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP); anterograde fiber tracing and excitotoxic lesion studies demonstrated that the CeLC PACAP/CGRP immunoreactivities represented sensory fiber projections from the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBn) along the spino-parabrachioamygdaloid tract. The same PBn PACAP/CGRP fiber system also projected to the BNST. As in the BNST, CeA PACAP signaling increased anxiety-like behaviors accompanied by weight loss and decreased feeding. But in addition to heightened anxiety-like responses, CeA PACAP signaling also altered nociception as reflected by decreased latency and threshold responses in thermal and mechanical sensitivity tests, respectively. From PACAP expression in major pain pathways, the current observations are novel and suggest that CeA PACAP nociceptive signaling and resulting neuroplasticity via the spino-parabrachioamygdaloid tract may represent mechanisms that associate chronic pain with sensory hypersensitivity, fear memory consolidation and severe behavioral disorders.",

abstract = "One of the hallmarks of alcohol dependence is the presence of a withdrawal syndrome during abstinence, which manifests as physical craving for alcohol accompanied by subjective feelings of anxiety. Using a model of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor in mice, we investigated the role of serotonin2c receptor (5HT2c-R) signaling in the BNST as a neural substrate underlying ethanol-induced anxiety during withdrawal. Mice were subjected to a 5-day CIE regimen of 16 h of ethanol vapor exposure followed by an 8 h ``withdrawal'' period between exposures. After the 5th and final exposure, mice were withdrawn for 24 h or 1 week before experiments began. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the social approach, light dark, and open field tests with mice showing deficits in social, but not general anxiety-like behavior that was alleviated by pretreatment with the 5HT2c-R antagonist SB 242,084 (3 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h and 1 week post-CIE. Using immunohistochemistry and whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we also found that CIE increased FOS-IR and enhanced neuronal excitability in the ventral BNST (vBNST) 24 h into withdrawal in a 5HT2c-R dependent manner. This enhanced excitability persisted for 1 week post-CIE. We also found that mCPP, a 5HT2c/b agonist, induced a more robust depolarization in cells of the vBNST in CIE mice, confirming that 5HT2c-R signaling is upregulated in the vBNST following CIE. Taken together, these results suggest that CIE upregulates 5HT2c-R signaling in the vBNST, leading to increased excitability. This enhanced excitability of the vBNST may drive increased anxiety-like behavior during ethanol withdrawal.",

Previous studies have established a role for the BNST in cue-induced cocaine seeking. However, it is unclear if the BNST underlies cue-induced seeking of other abused drugs such as ethanol. In the present set of experiments, BNST involvement in ethanol-seeking behavior was assessed in male DBA/2J mice using the conditioned place preference procedure (CPP). The BNST was inhibited during CPP expression using electrolytic lesions (Experiment 1), co-infusion of GABAA and GABAB receptor agonists muscimol and baclofen (M + B; Experiment 2), and activation of inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (hM4Di-DREADD) with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; Experiment 3). The magnitude of ethanol CPP was reduced significantly by each of these techniques. Notably, infusion of M + B (Exp. 2) abolished CPP altogether. Follow-up studies to Exp. 3 showed that ethanol cue-induced c-Fos immunoreactivity in the BNST was reduced by hM4Di activation (Experiment 4) and in the absence of hM4Di, CNO did not affect ethanol CPP (Experiment 5). Combined, these findings demonstrate that the BNST is involved in the modulation of cue-induced ethanol-seeking behavior.",

Here, we investigated the involvement of BNST cholinergic neurotransmission, acting via muscarinic receptors, in cardiovascular (increase in blood pressure and heart rate and fall in tail skin temperature) and neuroendocrine (increase in plasma corticosterone) responses and behavioral consequences (anxiogenic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze) evoked by acute restraint stress in rats. Bilateral microinjection into the BNST of either the choline uptake inhibitor hemicholinium-3 (3 nmol/100 nl) or the muscarinic receptor antagonist methylatropine (3 nmol/100 nl) enhanced the heart rate increase and inhibited the anxiogenic-like effect observed in the elevated plus-maze evoked by restraint. However, neither hemicholinium-3 nor methylatropine affected the increase in blood pressure and plasma corticosterone levels and the fall in tail skin temperature. Facilitation of local cholinergic signaling by microinjection of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine (0.1 nmol/100 nl) into the BNST reduced restraint-evoked pressor and tachycardiac responses and the fall in tail cutaneous temperature, without affecting the increase in plasma corticosterone. All effects of neostigmine were completely abolished by local BNST pretreatment with methylatropine. These findings indicate an opposite role of BNST cholinergic neurotransmission, acting via local muscarinic receptor, in control of cardiovascular responses (inhibitory influence) and emotional consequences (facilitatory influence) evoked by restraint stress. Furthermore, present findings provide evidence that BNST control of neuroendocrine responses to stress is mediated by mechanisms others than local cholinergic signaling.",

While progress has been made in understanding the contributions and characteristics of CRF as a neuropeptide in rodent behavior, little attention has been committed to determine the properties and synaptic physiology of specific populations of CRF-expressing (CRF(+)) and non-expressing (CRF(-)) neurons in the CeA and BnST. Here, we fill this gap by electrophysiologically characterizing distinct neuronal subtypes in CeA and BnST. Crossing tdTomato or channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2-YFP) reporter mice to those expressing Cre-recombinase under the CRF promoter allowed us to identify and manipulate CRF(+) and CRF(-) neurons in CeA and BnST, the two largest areas with fluorescently labeled neurons in these mice. We optogenetically activated CRF(+) neurons to elicit action potentials or synaptic responses in CRF(+) and CRF(-) neurons. We found that GABA is the predominant co-transmitter in CRF(+) neurons within the CeA and BnST. CRF(+) neurons are highly interconnected with CRF(-) neurons and to a lesser extent with CRF(+) neurons. CRF(+) and CRF(-) neurons differentially express tonic GABA currents. Chronic, unpredictable stress increase the amplitude of evoked IPSCs and connectivity between CRF(+) neurons, but not between CRF(+) and CRF(-) neurons in both regions. We propose that reciprocal inhibition of interconnected neurons controls CRF(+) output in these nuclei.",

In this review, we present an historical overview of research pertaining to the hippocampal cannabinoid system to provide context in which to understand the participation of the hippocampus in cognition, behavior, and epilepsy. We also examine potential roles for the hippocampal formation in mediating dysfunctional behavior, and assert that these phenomena reflect disordered physiological activity within the hippocampus and its interactions with other brain regions after exposure to synthetic cannabinoids, and the phytocannabinoids found in marijuana, such as $\Delta$(9)-THC and cannabidiol. In this regard, we examine contemporary hypotheses concerning the hippocampal endocannabinoid system's participation in psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, and epilepsy, and examine cannabinoid-sensitive cellular mechanisms contributing to coherent network oscillations as potential contributors to these disorders.",

Similarly, activation of preproglucagon (PPG) cells in the hindbrain which synthesize GLP-1, reduces food intake. However, it is far from clear whether this happens because of satiety, nausea, reduced reward, or even stress. Here we explore the role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), an area involved in feeding control as well as stress responses, in GLP-1 responses. Using cre-expressing mice we visualized projections of NTS PPG neurons and GLP-1R-expressing BNST cells with AAV-driven Channelrhodopsin-YFP expression. The BNST displayed many varicose YFP+ PPG axons in the ventral and less in the dorsal regions. Mice which express RFP in GLP-1R neurons had RFP+ cells throughout the BNST with the highest density in the dorsal part, suggesting that PPG neuron-derived GLP-1 acts in the BNST. Indeed, injection of GLP-1 into the BNST reduced chow intake during the dark phase, whereas injection of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist Ex9 increased feeding. BNST-specific GLP-1-induced food suppression was less effective in mice on high fat (HF, 60\%) diet, and Ex9 had no effect. Restraint stress-induced hypophagia was attenuated by BNST Ex9 treatment, further supporting a role for endogenous brain GLP-1. Finally, whole-cell patch clamp recordings of RFP+ BNST neurons demonstrated that GLP-1 elicited either a depolarizing or hyperpolarizing reversible response that was of opposite polarity to that under dopamine. Our data support a physiological role for BNST GLP-1R in feeding, and suggest complex cellular responses to GLP-1 in this nucleus.",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) coordinates emotional behavioral responses through glutamatergic outputs to downstream regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We explored the effects of chronic stress on BLA outputs to the PFC, NAcc and BNST using slice electrophysiology combined with optogenetics in two inbred mouse strains with distinct stress-induced anxiety responses. We found that ten consecutive days of chronic restraint stress enhanced pre-synaptic glutamate release at BLA-to-PFC synapses in C57BL/6J mice, but reduced pre-synaptic glutamate release at these synapses in DBA/2J mice. To assess the behavioral relevance of enhanced glutamate output at BLA-to-PFC synapses, we approximated the effects of chronic stress on the BLA-PFC circuit using optogenetics. We found that photostimulation of the BLA-PFC circuit in unstressed C57BL/6J mice produced persistent (i.e., post-stimulation) increased anxiety-like behavior and hyperactivity in the elevated plus-maze - a profile consistent with prototypical behavioral responses of stressed C57BL/6J mice.

There is a need to develop novel anticonvulsants that can specifically target aberrant Na channel activity associated with SCN8A gain-of-function mutations. In this study, we investigate the effects of Prax330, a novel Na channel inhibitor, on the biophysical properties of WT NaV1.6 and the patient mutation p.Asn1768Asp (N1768D) in ND7/23 cells. The effects of Prax330 on persistent (INaP) and resurgent (INaR) Na currents and neuronal excitability in subiculum neurons from a knock-in mouse model of the Scn8a-N1768D mutation (Scn8aD/+) were also examined. In ND7/23 cells, Prax330 reduced INaP currents recorded from cells expressing Scn8a-N1768D and hyperpolarized steady-state inactivation curves. Recordings from brain slices demonstrated elevated INaP and INaR in subiculum neurons from Scn8aD/+ mutant mice and abnormally large action potential (AP) burst-firing events in a subset of neurons. Prax330 (1 $\mu$M) reduced both INaP and INaR and suppressed AP bursts, with smaller effect on AP waveforms that had similar morphology to WT neurons. Prax330 (1 $\mu$M) also reduced synaptically-evoked APs in Scn8aD/+ subiculum neurons but not in WT neurons.

One such region is the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), which has been linked to both alcohol consumption and alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety and depression. Recently, we identified a GABAergic microcircuit in the BNST that regulates anxiety-like behavior. In the present study, we examined how chronic alcohol exposure alters this BNST GABAergic microcircuit in mice. We selectively targeted neurons expressing corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) using a CRF-reporter mouse line and combined retrograde labeling to identify BNST projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and lateral hypothalamus (LH). Following 72 h of withdrawal from four weekly cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure, the excitability of a sub-population of putative local CRF neurons that did not project to either VTA or LH (CRFnon-VTA/LH neurons) was increased. Withdrawal from CIE also increased excitability of non-CRF BNST neurons that project to both LH and VTA (BNSTnon-CRF-proj neurons). Furthermore, both populations of neurons had a reduction in spontaneous EPSC amplitude while frequency was unaltered. Withdrawal from chronic alcohol was accompanied by a significant increase in spontaneous IPSC frequency selectively in the BNSTnon-CRF-proj neurons. Together, these data suggest that withdrawal from chronic ethanol dysregulates local CRF-GABAergic microcircuit to inhibit anxiolytic outputs of the BNST which may contribute to enhanced anxiety during alcohol withdrawal and drive alcohol-seeking behavior.",

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide highly expressed in the extended amygdala, a brain macrostructure involved in the response to threat that includes the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). The aim of this series of experiments was to systematically elucidate the role of the PACAP system of the CeA and BNST under both control, unstressed conditions and after the presentation of a stressor in rats. For this purpose, we used the acoustic startle response (ASR), an unconscious response to sudden acoustic stimuli sensitive to changes in stress which can be used as an operationalization of the hypervigilance present in anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. We found that infusion of PACAP, but not the related peptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), into either the CeA or the BNST causes a dose-dependent increase in ASR. In addition, while infusion of the antagonist PACAP(6-38) into either the CeA or the BNST does not affect ASR in non-stressed conditions, it prevents the sensitization of ASR induced by an acute footshock stress. Finally, we found that footshock stress induces a significant increase in PACAP, but not VIP, levels in both of these brain areas. Altogether, these data show that the PACAP system of the extended amygdala contributes to stress-induced hyperarousal and suggest it as a potential novel target for the treatment of stress-related disorders.",

abstract = "Nitric oxide (NO) release in the right medial prefrontal cortex (RmPFC) produces anxiogenesis. In the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a region that receives neuronal projections from the mPFC, NO provokes anxiety, an effect that is blocked by local injections of corticotrophin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) or n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonist. Anxiety is also enhanced by social defeat stress, and chronic stress impairs and facilitates, respectively, PFC and BNST roles in modulating behavioral responses to aversive situations. This study investigated whether the (i) chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) increases NO signaling in the mPFC; and/or (ii) anxiogenic effects provoked by the intra-RmPFC injection of NOC-9 (an NO donor) or by CSDS are prevented by intra-BNST injections of AP-7 (0.05 nmol) or CP 376395 (3.0 nmol), respectively, NMDAr and CRF1 antagonists, in male Swiss-Webster mice exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Results showed that (a) CSDS increased anxiety (i.e., reduced open-arm exploration) and repeatedly activated nNOS-containing neurons, as measured by $\Delta$FosB (a stable nonspecific marker of neural activity) + nNOS double-labeling, in the right (but not left) mPFC, (b) NOC-9 in the RmPFC also increased anxiety, and (c) both CSDS and NOC-9 effects were reversed by injections of AP-7 or CP 376395 into the BNST. These results suggest that NMDA and CRF1 receptors located in BNST play an important role in the modulation of anxiety provoked by NO in the RmPFC, as well as by chronic social defeat in mice.",

Many studies over the years have revealed a number of roles for this neuropeptide in body temperature regulation, feeding, analgesia, ethanol sensitivity, psychosis, substance use, and pain. This review provides a general survey of the role of neurotensin with a focus on modalities that we believe to be particularly relevant to the study of reward. We focus on NTS signaling in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, lateral hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and central amygdala. Studies on the role of NTS outside of the ventral tegmental area are still in their relative infancy, yet they reveal a complex role for neurotensinergic signaling in reward-related behaviors that merits further study.",

abstract = "Intense stress precipitates symptoms in disorders such as post-traumatic stress (PTSD) and schizophrenia. Patients with these disorders have dysfunctional sensorimotor gating as indexed by disrupted prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI), which refers to decreased startle response when a weak pre-stimulus precedes a startling stimulus. Stress promotes release of norepinephrine (NE) and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) within the brain, neurotransmitters that also modulate PPI. We have shown that repeated stress causes sensitization of NE receptors within the basolateral amygdala (BLA) via CRF receptors and promotes long-lasting PPI disruptions and startle abnormalities. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is another crucial brain region that could be involved in stress-induced alterations in NE and CRF functions to promote PPI changes as this anatomical structure is enriched in CRF and NE receptors that have been shown to regulate each other. We hypothesized that repeated infusions of NE into the BNST would cross-sensitize CRF receptors or vice versa to alter PPI. Separate groups of male Sprague Dawley rats received, CRF (200ng/0.5 $\mu$l), NE (20$\mu$g/0.5 $\mu$l), or vehicle into the BNST, once/day for 3 days and PPI was tested after each infusion. Repeated CRF-or vehicle-treated rats were then challenged with a subthreshold dose of NE (0.3$\mu$g/0.5 $\mu$l) while repeated NE-treated rats were challenged with CRF (200ng/0.5 $\mu$l), and PPI was measured. Surprisingly, initial/repeated CRF or vehicle in the BNST had no effects on PPI. In contrast, initial and repeated NE disrupted PPI. Sub-threshold NE challenge in rats that previously received repeated CRF had no effect on PPI. Interestingly though, intra-BNST challenge dose of CRF significantly disrupted PPI in rats that previously had received repeated NE infusions. Taken together, these results indicate that repeated stress-induced NE release could alter the activity of CRF receptors in the BNST to modulate sensorimotor gating as measured through PPI.",

abstract = "The dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTDL) has high expression of oxytocin (OT) receptors (OTR), which were shown to facilitate cued fear. However, the role of OTR in the modulation of BNSTDL activity remains elusive. BNSTDL contains GABA-ergic neurons classified based on intrinsic membrane properties into three types. Using in vitro patch-clamp recordings in male rats, we demonstrate that OT selectively excites and increases spontaneous firing rate of Type I BNSTDL neurons. As a consequence, OT increases the frequency, but not amplitude, of spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) selectively in Type II neurons, an effect abolished by OTR antagonist or tetrodotoxin, and reduces spontaneous firing rate in these neurons. These results suggest an indirect effect of OT in Type II neurons, which is mediated via OT-induced increase in firing of Type I interneurons. As Type II BNSTDL neurons were shown projecting to the central amygdala (CeA), we also recorded from retrogradely labeled BNST$\rightarrow$CeA neurons and we show that OT increases the frequency of sIPSC in these Type II BNST$\rightarrow$CeA output neurons. In contrast, in Type III neurons, OT reduces the amplitude, but not frequency, of both sIPSCs and evoked IPSCs via a postsynaptic mechanism without changing their intrinsic excitability. We present a model of fine-tuned modulation of BNSTDL activity by OT, which selectively excites BNSTDL interneurons and inhibits Type II BNST$\rightarrow$CeA output neurons. These results suggest that OTR in the BNST might facilitate cued fear by inhibiting the BNST$\rightarrow$CeA neurons.",

author = "Jaramillo, A A and Brown, J A and Winder, D G",
abstract = "Our understanding of the role of the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) has evolved as technology has advanced, in part due to cell-specific studies and complex behavioral assays. This is reflected in the heterogeneous neuronal populations within the PBN to the extended amygdala (EA) circuits which encompass the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and central amygdala (CeA) circuitry, as they differentially modulate aspects of behavior in response to diverse threat-like contexts necessary for survival. Here we review how the PBN$\rightarrow$CeA and PBN$\rightarrow$BNST pathways differentially modulate fear-like behavior, innate and conditioned, through unique changes in neurotransmission in response to stress-inducing contexts. Furthermore, we hypothesize how in specific instances the PBN$\rightarrow$CeA and PBN$\rightarrow$BNST circuits are redundant and in part intertwined with their respective reciprocal projections. By deconstructing the interoceptive and exteroceptive components of affect- and stress related behavioral paradigms, evidence suggests that the PBN$\rightarrow$CeA circuit modulates innate response to physical stimuli and fear conditioning. Conversely, the PBN$\rightarrow$BNST circuit modulates distress-like stress in unpredictable contexts. Thereby, the PBN provides a pathway for alarming interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli to be processed and relayed to the EA to induce stress-relevant affect. Additionally, we provide a framework for future studies to detail the cell-type specific intricacies of PBN$\rightarrow$EA circuits in mediating behavioral responses to threats, and the relevance of the PBN in drug-use as it relates to threat and negative reinforcement.",

abstract = "Prolonged severe hypoxia follows brief seizures and represents a mechanism underlying several negative postictal manifestations without interventions. Approximately 50\% of the postictal hypoxia phenomenon can be accounted for by arteriole vasoconstriction. What accounts for the rest of the drop in unbound oxygen is unclear. Here, we determined the effect of pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial function on tissue oxygenation in the hippocampus of rats after repeatedly evoked seizures. Rats were treated with mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4 dinitrophenol (DNP) or antioxidants. Oxygen profiles were recorded using a chronically implanted oxygen-sensing probe, before, during, and after seizure induction. Mitochondrial function and redox tone were measured using in vitro mitochondrial assays and immunohistochemistry. Postictal cognitive impairment was assessed using the novel object recognition task. Mild mitochondrial uncoupling by DNP raised hippocampal oxygen tension and ameliorated postictal hypoxia. Chronic DNP also lowered mitochondrial oxygen-derived reactive species and oxidative stress in the hippocampus during postictal hypoxia. Uncoupling the mitochondria exerts therapeutic benefits on postictal cognitive dysfunction. Finally, antioxidants do not affect postictal hypoxia, but protect the brain from associated cognitive deficits. We provided evidence for a metabolic component of the prolonged oxygen deprivation that follow seizures and its pathological sequelae. Furthermore, we identified a molecular underpinning of this metabolic component, which involves excessive oxygen conversion into reactive species. Mild mitochondrial uncoupling may be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat the postictal state where seizure control is absent or poor.",

abstract = "The amygdala is a key structure mediating emotional processing. Few studies have used direct electrical stimulation of the amygdala in humans to examine stimulation-elicited physiological and emotional responses, and the nature of such effects remains unclear. Determining the effects of electrical stimulation of the amygdala has important theoretical implications for current discrete and dimensional neurobiological theories of emotion, which differ substantially in their predictions about the emotional effects of such stimulation. To examine the effects of amygdala stimulation on physiological and subjective emotional responses we examined epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring in which depth electrodes were implanted unilaterally or bilaterally in the amygdala. Nine subjects underwent both sham and acute monopolar electrical stimulation at various parameters in electrode contacts located in amygdala and within lateral temporal cortex control locations. Stimulation was applied at either 50 Hz or 130 Hz, while amplitudes were increased stepwise from 1 to 12 V, with subjects blinded to stimulation condition. Electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR) were simultaneously recorded and subjective emotional response was probed after each stimulation period. Amygdala stimulation (but not lateral control or sham stimulation) elicited immediate and substantial dose-dependent increases in EDA and decelerations of HR, generally without affecting RR. Stimulation elicited subjective emotional responses only rarely, and did not elicit clinical seizures in any subject. These physiological results parallel stimulation findings with animals and are consistent with orienting/defensive responses observed with aversive visual stimuli in humans. In summary, these findings suggest that acute amygdala stimulation in humans can be safe and can reliably elicit changes in emotion physiology without significantly affecting subjective emotional experience, providing a useful approach for investigation of amygdala-mediated modulatory effects on cognition.",

abstract = "The amygdala is crucially implicated in processing emotional information from various sensory modalities. However, there is dearth of knowledge concerning the integration and relative time-course of its responses across different channels, i.e., for auditory, visual, and audiovisual input. Functional neuroimaging data in humans point to a possible role of this region in the multimodal integration of emotional signals, but direct evidence for anatomical and temporal overlap of unisensory and multisensory-evoked responses in amygdala is still lacking. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activity from 9 amygdalae using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in patients prior to epilepsy surgery, and compared electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, or neutral stimuli presented either in voices alone, faces alone, or voices and faces simultaneously delivered. Results showed differential amygdala responses to fearful stimuli, in comparison to neutral, reaching significance 100-200 ms post-onset for auditory, visual and audiovisual stimuli. At later latencies, ∼400 ms post-onset, amygdala response to audiovisual information was also amplified in comparison to auditory or visual stimuli alone. Importantly, however, we found no evidence for either super- or subadditivity effects in any of the bimodal responses. These results suggest, first, that emotion processing in amygdala occurs at globally similar early stages of perceptual processing for auditory, visual, and audiovisual inputs; second, that overall larger responses to multisensory information occur at later stages only; and third, that the underlying mechanisms of this multisensory gain may reflect a purely additive response to concomitant visual and auditory inputs. Our findings provide novel insights on emotion processing across the sensory pathways, and their convergence within the limbic system.",

Most studies have concentrated their attention on seizure-induced reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway. The present study examined the projection pathway of the CA1 pyramidal neurons to the subiculum, which is the output of the hippocampal formation in five models of TLE. We examined the laminar pattern of Timm's histochemistry in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1 in three acute and two chronic models of TLE: intraventricular kainic acid (KA), systemic KA, systemic pilocarpine, chronic electric kindling and chronic i.p. pentylenetetrazol. The laminar pattern of Timm histochemistry in the stratum moleculare of CA1 was permanently remodeled in epileptic models suggesting sprouting of Timm containing terminals from the adjacent stratum lacunosum. Ultrastructural examination confirmed that Timm granules were localized in synaptic terminals. As the source of Timm-labeled terminals in this region was not known, sodium selenite, a selective retrograde tracer for zinc-containing terminals, was iontophoretically injected in vivo in rats exposed to systemic pilocarpine, systemic KA or chronic pentylenetetrazol. The normal projection of CA1 pyramidal neurons to the subiculum is topographically organized in a lamellar fashion. In normal rats, the extent of the injection site (terminals) and the retrogradely labeled pyramidal neurons (cell soma) corresponded to the same number of lamellas. In epileptic rats, the retrograde labeling extended 42-67\% farther than the normal dorso-ventral extent including lamellas above and below the expected. This is direct evidence for sprouting of CA1 pyramidal axons into the subiculum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 region confirming the alterations of the laminar pattern of Timm's histochemistry. Sprouting of the CA1 projection to subiculum across hippocampal lamellas might lead to translamellar hyperexcitability, and to amplification and synchronization of epileptic discharges in the output gate of the hippocampal formation.",

Using a seizure-prone Fast-kindling rat strain with known comorbid behavioral features, we investigated the effects of VNS on spatial memory, epileptogenesis, kindled seizures and body weight. Electrodes were implanted in both amygdalae and around the left vagus nerve of 17 rats. Following recovery, rats were tested in the Morris water-maze utilizing a fixed platform paradigm. The VNS group received 2 h of stimulation prior to entering the Morris water-maze. Rats were then tested in the kindling paradigm wherein the VNS group received 2 h of stimulation prior to daily kindling stimulation. Finally, the abortive effects of acute VNS against kindling-induced seizures were determined in fully kindled rats by applying VNS immediately after the kindling pulse. Body weight, water consumption and food intake were measured throughout. Memory performance in the Morris water-maze was not different between control and vagus nerve stimulation rats. Similarly, kindling rate was unaffected by antecedent VNS. However, pro-convulsive effects (P<0.05) were noted, when VNS was administered prior to the kindling pulse in fully kindled rats. Yet, paradoxically, VNS showed anti-convulsant effects (P<0.01) in those rats when applied immediately after the kindling stimulus. Body weight was significantly lower throughout kindling (P<0.01) in VNS-treated rats compared with controls, which was associated with reduced food intake (P<0.05), but without difference in water consumption. VNS appears to be devoid of significant cognitive side effects in the Morris water-maze in Fast rats. Although VNS exhibited no prophylactic effect on epileptogenesis or seizure severity when applied prior to the kindling stimulus, it showed significant anti-convulsant effects in fully kindled rats when applied after seizure initiation. Lastly, VNS prevented the weight gain associated with kindling through reduced food intake.",

abstract = "Activation of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor, a major G-protein-coupled receptor in brain, acts to regulate neuronal excitability and has been shown to mediate the anticonvulsant effects of cannabinoids in several animal models of seizure, including the rat pilocarpine model of acquired epilepsy. However, the long-term effects of status epilepticus on the expression and function of the CB1 receptor have not been described. Therefore, this study was initiated to evaluate the effect of status epilepticus on CB1 receptor expression, binding, and G-protein activation in the rat pilocarpine model of acquired epilepsy. Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that status epilepticus causes a unique ``redistribution'' of hippocampal CB1 receptors, consisting of specific decreases in CB1 immunoreactivity in the dense pyramidal cell layer neuropil and dentate gyrus inner molecular layer, and increases in staining in the CA1-3 strata oriens and radiatum. In addition, this study demonstrates that the redistribution of CB1 receptor expression results in corresponding functional changes in CB1 receptor binding and G-protein activation using [3H] R+-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-yl](1-napthalen-yl)methanone mesylate (WIN55,212-2) and agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography, respectively. The redistribution of CB1 receptor-mediated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was 1) attributed to an altered maximal effect (Emax) of WIN55,212-2 to stimulate [35S]GTPgammaS binding, 2) reversed by the CB1 receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (SR141716A), 3) confirmed by the use of other CB1 receptor agonists, and 4) not reproduced in other G-protein-coupled receptor systems examined.

This study aimed to clarify the influence of absence seizure in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors using normal Wistar rats and Long-Evans rats with spontaneous spike-wave discharges (SWDs). Anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated by the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests, and depression-like behaviors by the forced swimming (FS) and sucrose consumption (SC) tests. Long-Evans rats displayed significantly higher frequency and longer duration in the open arms of the EPM and in the center zone of the OF than did Wistar rats. Normalized behavioral indexes by movement also were significantly higher in Long-Evans rats. An excess of SWD numbers was associated with lower indexes and worse movement in the two behavioral tests. Ethosuximide eliminated the seizure frequency-dependent relationship and also significantly increased all indexes of the EPM test. Additionally, Long-Evans rats revealed significantly longer immobility in the FS test and lower consumption of sucrose solution in the SC test than did Wistar rats. Meanwhile, no relationship was found between immobility of the FS test and SWD number. Ethosuximide ameliorated depression-like behavior of Long-Evans rats that was equal to that of Wistar rats. Thus, Long-Evans rats showed seizure frequency-related exacerbation in anxiety-like behavior; and they displayed a depressive propensity. Our data suggest that generalized SWDs may have distinct influences in anxious and depressive behaviors.",

We made injections of the retrograde tracer fluorogold centered around the ``waist'' area of the PbN, whose neurons are known to be highly responsive to taste stimuli. Retrogradely labeled neurons were found in the infralimbic, dysgranular and agranular insular cortex as well as the claustrum; the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the substantia innominata; the central nucleus of the amygdala; the lateral and medial preoptic areas, the paraventricular, the dorsomedial, the ventromedial, the arcuate, and the lateral hypothalamic areas; the periaqueductal gray, the substantia nigra pars compacta, and the ventral tegmental area; the supratrigeminal nucleus, rostral and caudal nucleus of the solitary tract; the parvicellular intermediate and gigantocellular reticular nucleus; the caudal and interpolar divisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsomedial spinal trigeminal nucleus, and the area postrema. Numbers of labeled neurons in the main components of the gustatory system including the insular cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and rostral nucleus of the solitary tract were quantified. These results are basically consistent with those of the previous rat and hamster studies, but some species differences were found. Functional implications of these afferent inputs are discussed with an emphasis on their role in taste.",

abstract = "Hypoxic respiratory and cardiovascular responses in mammals are mediated by peripheral chemoreceptor afferents which are relayed centrally via the solitary tract nucleus (NTS) in dorsomedial medulla to other cardiorespiratory-related brainstem regions such as ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Here, we test the hypothesis that peripheral chemoafferents could also be relayed directly to the K{\"o}lliker-Fuse/parabrachial complex in dorsolateral pons, an area traditionally thought to subserve pneumotaxic and cardiovascular regulation. Experiments were performed on adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Brainstem neurons with axons projecting to the dorsolateral pons were retrogradely labeled by microinjection with choleras toxin subunit B (CTB). Neurons involved in peripheral chemoreflex were identified by hypoxia-induced c-Fos expression. We found that double-labeled neurons (i.e. immunopositive to both CTB and c-Fos) were localized mostly in the commissural and medial subnuclei of NTS and to a lesser extent in the ventrolateral NTS subnucleus, VLM and ventrolateral pontine A5 region. Extracellular recordings from the commissural and medial NTS subnuclei revealed that some hypoxia-excited NTS neurons could be antidromically activated by electrical stimulations at the dorsolateral pons. These findings demonstrate that hypoxia-activated afferent inputs are relayed to the K{\"o}lliker-Fuse/parabrachial complex directly via the commissural and medial NTS and indirectly via the ventrolateral NTS subnucleus, VLM and A5 region. These pontine-projecting peripheral chemoafferent inputs may play an important role in the modulation of cardiorespiratory regulation by dorsolateral pons.",

abstract = "A substantial array of respiratory, cardiovascular, visceral and somatic afferents are relayed via the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) to the brainstem (and forebrain). Despite some degree of overlap within the NTS, specificity is maintained in central respiratory reflexes driven by second order afferent relay neurons in the NTS. While the topographic arrangement of respiratory-related afferents targeting the NTS has been extensively investigated, their higher order brainstem targets beyond the NTS has only rarely been defined with any precision. Nonetheless, the various brainstem circuits serving blood gas homeostasis and airway protective reflexes must clearly receive a differential innervation from the NTS in order to evoke stimulus appropriate behavioral responses. Accordingly, we have examined the question of which specific NTS nuclei project to particular compartments within the ventral respiratory column (VRC) of the ventrolateral medulla. Our analyses of NTS labeling after retrograde tracer injections in the VRC and the nearby neuronal groups controlling autonomic function indicate a significant distinction between projections to the B{\"o}tzinger complex and preB{\"o}tzinger complex compared to the remainder of the VRC. Specifically, the caudomedial NTS, including caudal portions of the medial solitary nucleus and the commissural division of NTS project relatively densely to the region of the retrotrapezoid nucleus and rostral ventrolateral medullary nucleus as well as to the rostral ventral respiratory group while avoiding the intervening B{\"o}tzinger and preB{\"o}tzinger complexes. Area postrema appears to demonstrate a pattern of projections similar to that of caudal medial and commissural NTS nuclei. Other, less pronounced differential projections of lateral NTS nuclei to the various VRC compartments are additionally noted.",

abstract = "The glomus cells in the carotid bodies (CB) detect alterations in pH and pCO₂ and low pO₂ level in arterial blood. The carotid sinus nerve conveys the information related to the oxygen level to 2nd-order neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) via tractus solitarius (TS), which is part of the chemoreflex pathways. It has been demonstrated that in 2nd-order NTS neurons receiving inputs from the aortic depressor nerve (ADN), the TS stimulation presents high temporal fidelity. However, the temporal properties of synaptic activity in NTS neurons receiving inputs from CB were not yet fully investigated. Herein using patch-clamp recordings in NTS brainstem slices, we studied TS-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (TS-eEPSCs) on morphologically identified 2nd-order NTS neurons that receive afferent inputs from the CB and compared with 2nd-order ADN-NTS neurons recorded in the same experimental conditions. The amplitudes of TS-eEPSCs were similar in both groups, but the latencies and standard deviation (SD) of latency were significantly higher in the CB-NTS neurons (latency: 4$\pm$0.2 ms, SD: 0.49$\pm$0.03 ms) than in ADN-NTS neurons (latency: 3.3$\pm$0.3 ms, SD: 0.19$\pm$0.02 ms; P=0.049 for latency and P<0.001 for SD of latency). In a series of double-labeling experiments, we confirmed that some CB-NTS 2nd-order neurons send direct projections to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). We conclude that: (a) CB-NTS 2nd-order neurons present temporally distinct postsynaptic currents when compared with ADN-NTS 2nd-order neurons; (b) low SD of latency of TS-eEPSCs is not necessarily a characteristic of all 2nd-order neurons in the NTS; and (c) the presence of direct connections between these 2nd-order neurons in the NTS and RVLM is indicative that these synaptic properties of CB-NTS neurons are relevant for the processing of respiratory and autonomic responses to chemoreflex activation.",

Thus for the purpose of this work in which we aim to bring those factors together to explain how they interact with epilepsy, we only provide brief descriptions. We present reported evidence supporting the existence of the epileptic brain in several states; interictal, peri-ictal and ictal, each with distinct excitability features. We then provide an overview of how many physiological factors influence the excitatory/inhibitory balance within the interictal state, where the networks are presumed to be functioning normally.

abstract = "The incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is highest in people with chronic and drug-resistant epilepsy. Chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures cause cardiorespiratory autonomic dysfunctions. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is neuroprotective, whereas microglia produce both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS. During acute seizures in rats, PACAP and microglia produce sympathoprotective effect at the intermediolateral cell column (IML), whereas their action on the presympathetic rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) neurons mediates proarrhythmogenic changes. We evaluated the effect of PACAP and microglia at the IML on sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), cardiovascular reflex responses, and electrocardiographic changes in the post-status epilepticus (SE) model of acquired epilepsy, and control rats. Chronic spontaneous seizures in rats produced tachycardia with profound proarrhythmogenic effects (prolongation of QT interval). Antagonism of microglia, but not PACAP, significantly reduced the SNA and the corrected QT interval in post-SE rats. PACAP and microglia antagonists did not change baroreflex and peripheral or central chemoreflex responses with varied effect on somatosympathetic responses in post-SE and control rats. We did not notice changes in microglial morphology or changes in a number of M2 phenotype in epileptic nor control rats in the vicinity of RVLM neurons. Our findings establish that microglial activation, and not PACAP, at the IML accounts for higher SNA and proarrhythmogenic changes during chronic epilepsy in rats. This is the first experimental evidence to support a neurotoxic effect of microglia during chronic epilepsy, in contrast to their neuroprotective action during acute seizures.",

Optogenetic activation of CCKNTS axon terminals within either the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) or the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) is sufficient to suppress feeding. An interesting dichotomy has been revealed when assessing the motivational valence of these two circuits. Activating CCKNTS cell bodies is aversive as demonstrated by conditioned taste aversion and place-preference assays. Activation of the CCKNTS$\rightarrow$PBN pathway is also aversive; however, stimulating the CCKNTS$\rightarrow$PVH pathway is appetitive when assayed using a real-time, place-preference task. Thus, these two projections from CCKNTS neurons reduce food intake through opposite motivational states; one pathway signals positive valence (CCKNTS$\rightarrow$PVH) and the other signals negative valence (CCKNTS$\rightarrow$PBN).",

abstract = "Recent reports demonstrate that DNA damage is induced, and rapidly repaired, in circuits activated by experience. Moreover, stress hormones are known to slow DNA repair, suggesting that prolonged stress may result in persistent DNA damage. Prolonged stress is known to negatively impact physical and mental health; however, DNA damage as a factor in stress pathology has only begun to be explored. Histone H2A-X phosphorylated at serine 139 ($\gamma$H2AX) is a marker of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), a type of damage that may lead to cell death if unrepaired. We hypothesized that a 14 day period of variable stress exposure sufficient to alter anxiety-like behavior in male C57BL/6J mice would produce an increase in $\gamma$H2AX levels in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a region implicated in anxiety and stress regulation. We observed that 14 days of variable stress, but not a single stress exposure, was associated with increased levels of $\gamma$H2AX 24 hours after termination of the stress paradigm. Further investigation found that phosphorylation levels of a pair of kinases associated with the DNA damage response, glycogen synthase kinase 3 $\beta$ (GSK3$\beta$) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) were also elevated following variable stress. Our results suggest that unrepaired DNA DSBs and/or repetitive attempted repair may represent an important component of the allostatic load that stress places on the brain.",

abstract = "Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS) and mediates chemoreflex function during periods of low oxygen (i.e. hypoxia). We have previously shown that nTS excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), specifically EAAT-2, located on glia modulate neuronal activity, cardiorespiratory and chemoreflex function under normal conditions via its tonic uptake of extracellular glutamate. Chronic sustained hypoxia (SH) elevates nTS synaptic transmission and chemoreflex function. The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which glial EAAT-2 contributes to SH-induced nTS synaptic alterations. To do so, male Sprague-Dawley rats (4-7 weeks) were exposed to either 1, 3, or 7 days of SH (10\% O2, 24 h/day) and compared to normoxic controls (21\% O2, 24 h/day, i.e., 0 days SH). After which, the nTS was harvested for patch clamp electrophysiology, quantitative real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoblots. SH induced time- and parameter-dependent increases in excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). TS-evoked EPSC amplitude increased after 1D SH which returned at 3D and 7D SH. Spontaneous EPSC frequency increased only after 3D SH, which returned to normoxic levels at 7D SH. EPSC enhancement occurred primarily by presynaptic mechanisms. Inhibition of EAAT-2 with dihydrokainate (DHK, 300 µM) did not alter EPSCs following 1D SH but induced depolarizing inward currents (Ihold). After 3D SH, DHK decreased TS-EPSC amplitude yet its resulting Ihold was eliminated. EAAT-2 mRNA and protein increased after 3D and 7D SH, respectively. These data suggest that SH alters the expression and function of EAAT-2 which may have a neuroprotective effect.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. A proposed risk marker for SUDEP is the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES). The mechanisms underlying PGES are unknown. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in SUDEP pathophysiology. Seizures suppress activity of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We hypothesized that suppression of DRN 5-HT neuron activity contributes to PGES and increasing 5-HT neurotransmission or stimulating the DRN before a seizure would decrease PGES duration. Adult C57BL/6J and Pet1-Cre mice received EEG/EMG electrodes, a bipolar stimulating/recording electrode in the right basolateral amygdala, and either a microdialysis guide cannula or an injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) allowing expression of channelrhodopsin2 plus an optic fiber into the DRN. Systemic application of the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram (20 mg/kg) decreased PGES duration from seizures induced during wake (n = 23) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (n = 13) whereas fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) pretreatment decreased PGES duration following seizures induced from wake (n = 11), but not NREM sleep (n = 9). Focal chemical (n = 6) or optogenetic (n = 8) stimulation of the DRN reduced PGES duration following seizures in kindled mice induced during wake. During PGES, animals exhibited immobility and suppression of EEG activity that was reduced by citalopram pretreatment. These results suggest 5-HT and the DRN may regulate PGES.",

PTSD may be the most representative of context processing pathology, as intrusive memories are experienced in ``safe'' contexts.

The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) contributes to anxiety-like behaviors as well as context fear conditioning. Given the important roles of the BNST and the vSUB in these anxiety and fear-related behaviors, and the anatomical connections between the two brain regions, the major aims of this study were to characterize the anatomy and function of the vSUB-BNST pathway. First, using the retrograde tracer cholera toxin, we mapped the topographical arrangement of the vSUB-BNST pathway. Dual retrograde tracing experiments revealed neurons projecting to the BNST and those projecting to the basolateral amygdala are distinct populations. Second, we assessed whether activity in this pathway, as indexed by FOS immunohistochemistry, was modulated by context fear conditioning. Our data reveal less activation of the vSUB-BNST pathway in both males and females in aversive contexts and the greatest activation when animals explored a neutral familiar context. In addition, the vSUB of females contained fewer GABAergic neurons compared to males. These findings suggest that the vSUB-BNST pathway is involved in eliciting appropriate responses to contexts.",

abstract = "Unlike focal or partial epilepsy, which has a confined range of influence, idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) often affects the whole or a larger portion of the brain without obvious, known cause. It is important to understand the underlying network which generates epileptic activity and through which epileptic activity propagates. The aim of the present study was to investigate the thalamocortical relationship using non-invasive imaging modalities in a group of IGE patients. We specifically investigated the roles of the mediodorsal nuclei in the thalami and the medial frontal cortex in generating and spreading IGE activities. We hypothesized that the connectivity between these two structures is key in understanding the generation and propagation of epileptic activity in brains affected by IGE. Using three imaging techniques of EEG, fMRI and EEG-informed fMRI, we identified important players in generation and propagation of generalized spike-and-wave discharges (GSWDs). EEG-informed fMRI suggested multiple regions including the medial frontal area near to the anterior cingulate cortex, mediodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, caudate nucleus among others that related to the GSWDs. The subsequent seed-based fMRI analysis revealed a reciprocal cortical and bi-thalamic functional connection. Through EEG-based Granger Causality analysis using (DTF) and adaptive DTF, within the reciprocal thalamocortical circuitry, thalamus seems to serve as a stronger source in driving cortical activity from initiation to the propagation of a GSWD. Such connectivity change starts before the GSWDs and continues till the end of the slow wave discharge. Thalamus, especially the mediodorsal nuclei, may serve as potential targets for deep brain stimulation to provide more effective treatment options for patients with drug-resistant generalized epilepsy.",

Ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncle and contralateral corpus callosum, anterior corona radiate, external capsule, optic radiation showed significant FA decrease at three months follow up but increase later.

While ipsilateral posterior limb of internal capsule, retrolenticular part of internal capsule and contralateral posterior corona radiate showed significant FA increase after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: FA changes after successful ATL presented as four distinct patterns, reflecting different structural adaptions following epilepsy surgery. Some FA increases indicated the reversibility of preoperative diffusion abnormalities and the possibility of structural reorganization, especially in the contralateral hemisphere.",

abstract = "Anticipation of potentially threatening social situations is a key process in social anxiety disorder (SAD). In other anxiety disorders, recent research of neural correlates of anticipation of temporally unpredictable threat suggests a temporally dissociable involvement of amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) with phasic amygdala responses and sustained BNST activation. However, the temporal profile of amygdala and BNST responses during temporal unpredictability of threat has not been investigated in patients suffering from SAD. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the BNST during anticipation of temporally unpredictable aversive (video camera observation) relative to neutral (no camera observation) events in SAD patients compared to healthy controls (HC). For the analysis of fMRI data, we applied two regressors (phasic/sustained) within the same model to detect temporally dissociable brain responses. The aversive condition induced increased anxiety in patients compared to HC. SAD patients compared to HC showed increased phasic activation in the CeA and the BNST for anticipation of aversive relative to neutral events. SAD patients as well as HC showed sustained activity alterations in the BNST for aversive relative to neutral anticipation. No differential activity during sustained threat anticipation in SAD patients compared to HC was found. Taken together, our study reveals both CeA and BNST involvement during threat anticipation in SAD patients. The present results point towards potentially SAD-specific threat processing marked by elevated phasic but not sustained CeA and BNST responses when compared to HC.",

abstract = "Background MR Imaging has shown atrophy in brainstem regions that were linked to autonomic dysfunction in epilepsy patients. The brainstem projects to and modulates the activation state of several wide-spread cortical/subcortical regions. The goal was to investigate 1. Impact of brainstem atrophy on gray matter connectivity of cortical/subcortical structures and autonomic control. 2. Impact on the modulation of cortical/subcortical functional connectivity. Methods 11 controls and 18 patients with non-lesional focal epilepsy (FE) underwent heart rate variability (HRV) measurements and a 3 T MRI (T1 in all subjects, task-free fMRI in 7 controls/ 12 FE). The brainstem was extracted, and atrophy assessed using deformation-based-morphometry. The age-corrected z-scores of the mean Jacobian determinants were extracted from 71 5x5x5 mm grids placed in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function. Cortical and non-brainstem subcortical gray matter atrophy was assessed with voxel-based-morphometry and mean age corrected z-scores of the modulated gray matter volumes extracted from 380 cortical/subcortical rois. The profile similarity index was used to characterize the impact of brainstem atrophy on gray matter connectivity. The fMRI was preprocessed in SPM12/Conn17 and the BOLD signal extracted from 398 ROIs (16 brainstem). A dynamic task-free analysis approach was used to identify activation states. Connectivity HRV relationship were assessed with Spearman rank correlations. Results HRV was negatively correlated with reduced brainstem right hippocampus/parahippocampus gray matter connectivity in controls (p < .05, FDR) and reduced brainstem to right parietal cortex, lingual gyrus, left hippocampus/amygdala, parahippocampus, temporal pole, and bilateral anterior thalamus connectivity in FE (p < .05, FDR). Dynamic task-free fMRI analysis identified 22 states. The strength of the functional brainstem/cortical connectivity of state 15 was negatively associated with HRV (r = −0.5, p = .03) and positively with decreased brainstem-cortical (0.49, p = .03) gray matter connectivity. Conclusion The findings of this small pilot study suggest that impaired brainstem-cortex gray matter connectivity in FE negatively affects the brainstem's ability to control cortical activation.",

abstract = "The circumstances surrounding SUDEP suggest autonomic or respiratory collapse, implying central failure of regulation or recovery. Characterisation of the communication among brain areas mediating such processes may shed light on mechanisms and noninvasively indicate risk. We used rs-fMRI to examine network properties among brain structures in people with epilepsy who suffered SUDEP (n = 8) over an 8-year follow-up period, compared with matched high- and low-risk subjects (n = 16/group) who did not suffer SUDEP during that period, and a group of healthy controls (n = 16). Network analysis was employed to explore connectivity within a 'regulatory-subnetwork' of brain regions involved in autonomic and respiratory regulation, and over the whole-brain. Modularity, the extent of network organization into separate modules, was significantly reduced in the regulatory-subnetwork, and the whole-brain, in SUDEP and high-risk. Increased participation, a local measure of inter-modular belonging, was evident in SUDEP and high-risk groups, particularly among thalamic structures. The medial prefrontal thalamus was increased in SUDEP compared with all other control groups, including high-risk. Patterns of hub topology were similar in SUDEP and high-risk, but were more extensive in low-risk patients, who displayed greater hub prevalence and a radical reorganization of hubs in the subnetwork. SUDEP is associated with reduced functional organization among cortical and sub-cortical brain regions mediating autonomic and respiratory regulation. Living high-risk subjects demonstrated similar patterns, suggesting such network measures may provide prospective risk-indicating value, though a crucial difference between SUDEP and high-risk was altered connectivity of the medial thalamus in SUDEP, which was also elevated compared with all sub-groups. Disturbed thalamic connectivity may reflect a potential non-invasive marker of elevated SUDEP risk.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) plays an important role in rodent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but evidence to support its relevance to human PTSD is limited. We sought to understand the role of the BNST in human PTSD via fMRI, behavioral, and physiological measurements. METHODS: 29 patients with PTSD (childhood sexual abuse) and 23 healthy controls (HC) underwent BOLD imaging with an emotional word paradigm. Symptom severity was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and HPA-axis dysfunction was assessed by measuring the diurnal cortisol amplitude index (DCAI). A data-driven multivariate analysis was used to determine BNST task-based functional co-occurrence (tbFC) across individuals. RESULTS: In the trauma-versus-neutral word contrast, patients showed increased activation compared to HC in the BNST, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), caudate heads, and midbrain, and decreased activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Symptom severity positively correlated with activity in the BNST, caudate head, amygdala, hippocampus, dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus (dACG), and PCG, and negatively with activity in the medial orbiotofrontal cortex (mOFC) and DLPFC. Patients and HC showed marked differences in the relationship between the DCAI and BOLD activity in the BNST, septal nuclei, dACG, and PCG. Patients showed stronger tbFC between the BNST and closely linked limbic and subcortical regions, and a loss of negative tbFC between the BNST and DLPFC.

However, neuronal activity patterns in relation to sustained components of the fear response remain elusive, so far. We used a fear training paradigm with unpredictable pairing of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli allowing distinction between phasic and sustained components of conditioned fear, and recorded single units in the anterolateral part of the BNST (BNSTal) in freely behaving mice. An objective, non-biased cluster-analysis was performed for each identified single unit on specific waveform-, activity-, stimulus-dependent and LFP-related parameters. The analysis revealed three distinct neuronal subpopulations of biphasic-, sustained fear on- and fear off-neurons. Results show that activities of biphasic- and sustained fear on-neurons temporally coincide with the shift from phasic to sustained components of the fear response. Presentation of non-conditioned auditory stimuli resulted in a variety of neuronal responses in BNSTal with no indication of biphasic response profiles. It is suggested that fear conditioning sharpens neuronal response profiles in BNSTal with biphasic-cells signaling phasic and sustained fear. These results confirm the pivotal role of BNST in processing sustained fear on the neuronal level, thereby complementing pharmacological experimental animal and human imaging data.",

This potentiation has been previously reported to depend upon the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Here, using temporary inactivation, we confirmed that the BNST is not necessary for the acquisition of cued or contextual fear memory. Systemic administration of the SSRI citalopram prior to fear conditioning led to an upregulation of the immediate early gene Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) in the oval nucleus of the BNST, and a majority of these neurons expressed the 5-HT2C receptor. Finally, local infusions of a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist directly into the oval nucleus of the BNST prevented the fear memory-enhancing effects of citalopram.

abstract = "Abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals experience an enduring sensitivity to cue-induced craving and relapse to drinking. There is considerable evidence indicating that structures within the midbrain and extended amygdala are involved in this process. Individually, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) have been shown to modulate cue-induced ethanol-seeking behavior. It is hypothesized that cue-induced seeking is communicated through a direct projection from the BNST to VTA. In the current experiments, an intersectional viral strategy was used in DBA/2J mice to selectively target and inhibit BNST projections to the VTA during a test of ethanol conditioned place preference (CPP). Inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (hM4Di DREADDs) were expressed in VTA-projecting BNST (BNST-VTA) cells by infusing a retrograde herpes-simplex virus encoding cre recombinase (HSV-Cre) into VTA and a cre-inducible adeno-associated virus encoding hM4Di (AAV-DIO-hM4Di) into BNST. Before testing the expression of preference, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) was peripherally administered to activate hM4Di receptors and selectively inhibit these cells. Ethanol CPP expression was blocked by CNO-mediated inhibition of BNST-VTA cells. A follow-up study revealed this effect was specific to CNO activation of hM4Di as saline- and CNO-treated mice infused with a control vector (HSV-GFP) in place of HSV-Cre showed significant CPP. These findings establish a role for a direct BNST input to VTA in cue-induced ethanol-seeking behavior.",

author = "Meloni, Edward G and Kaye, Karen T and Venkataraman, Archana and Carlezon, Jr, William A",
abstract = "The stress-related neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is implicated in neuromodulation of learning and memory. PACAP can alter synaptic plasticity and has direct actions on neurons in the amygdala and hippocampus that could contribute to its acute and persistent effects on the consolidation and expression of conditioned fear. We recently demonstrated that intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of PACAP prior to fear conditioning (FC) results in initial amnestic-like effects followed by hyper-expression of conditioned freezing with repeated testing, and analyses of immediate-early gene c-Fos expression suggested that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), but not the lateral/basolateral amygdala (LA/BLA) or hippocampus, are involved in these PACAP effects. Here, we extend that work by examining the expression of the synaptic plasticity marker activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg 3.1) after PACAP administration and FC. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with cannula for ICV infusion of PACAP-38 (1.5 µg) or vehicle followed by FC and tests for conditioned freezing. One hour after FC, Arc protein expression was significantly elevated in the CeA and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), interconnected structures that are key elements of the extended amygdala, in rats that received the combination of PACAP+FC. In contrast, Arc expression within the subdivisions of the hippocampus, or the LA/BLA, were unchanged. A subpopulation of Arc-positive cells in both the CeA and BNST also express PKCdelta, an intracellular marker that has been used to identify microcircuits that gate conditioned fear in the CeA. Consistent with our previous findings, on the following day conditioned freezing behavior was reduced in rats that had been given the combination of PACAP+FC-an amnestic-like effect-and Arc expression levels had returned to baseline. Given the established role of Arc in modifying synaptic plasticity and memory formation, our findings suggest that PACAP-induced overexpression of Arc following fear conditioning may disrupt neuroplastic changes within populations of CeA and BNST neurons normally responsible for encoding fear-related cues that, in this case, results in altered fear memory consolidation. Hence, PACAP systems may represent an axis on which stress and experience-driven neurotransmission converge to alter emotional memory, and mediate pathologies that are characteristic of psychiatric illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder.",

author = "Ressler, Reed L and Goode, Travis D and Evemy, Carolyn and Maren, Stephen",
abstract = "Considerable work demonstrates that Pavlovian fear conditioning depends on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent plasticity within the amygdala. In addition, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has also been implicated in fear conditioning, particularly in the expression of fear to poor predictors of threat. We recently found that the expression of backward (BW) fear conditioning, in which an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) follows a footshock unconditioned stimulus (US), requires the BNST; the expression of forward (FW) fear conditioning was not disrupted by BNST inactivation. However, whether NMDA receptors within the BNST contribute to the acquisition of fear conditioning is unknown. Moreover, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), which has extensive connections with the BNST, is critically involved in FW conditioning, however whether it participates in BW conditioning has not been explored. Here we test the specific hypothesis that the CeA and the BNST mediate the acquisition of FW and BW fear conditioning, respectively. Adult female and male rats were randomly assigned to receive bilateral infusions of the NMDA receptor antagonist, D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV), into the CeA or BNST prior to FW or BW fear conditioning. We found that intra-CeA APV impaired the acquisition of both FW and BW conditioning, whereas intra-BNST APV produced selective deficits in BW conditioning. Moreover, APV in the BNST significantly reduced contextual freezing, whereas CeA NMDA receptor antagonism impeded early but not long-lasting contextual fear. Collectively, these data reveal that CeA and BNST NMDA receptors have unique roles in fear conditioning.",

abstract = "Recurrent epileptic seizures in the rat enhance the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its mRNA in various brain areas including the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and the amygdala. In the hippocampus, the most prominent expression of NPY is observed in mossy fibers and in GABAergic interneurons. At the same time, expression of Y2 receptors is also increased whereas Y1 receptors are reduced. Similar changes in Y1 and Y2 receptors were observed in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In contrast to the rat, NPY expression is not enhanced in mossy fibers in TLE. In the same tissue, surviving NPY interneurons show marked axonal sprouting into areas innervated by mossy fibers (dentate hilus, stratum lucidum, inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus). Stimulation of presynaptic Y2 receptors inhibits glutamate release, and exert an anticonvulsant action in experimental models. Y1 receptors mediate a weak excitatory component of NPY action. These findings suggest that changes in the NPY system induced by seizures represent an endogenous adaptive mechanism aimed at counteracting hyperexcitability underlying epileptic activity. This concept is strongly supported by evidence that genetically modified rats overexpressing the NPY gene are less susceptible to seizures while deletion of NPY or Y2 receptor genes results in increased susceptibility to seizures.",

author = "Mazarati, Andrey M",
abstract = "The shift in the balance between the inhibition and the excitation in favor of the latter is a major mechanism of the evolvement of epileptic seizures. On the neurotransmitter level two major players contribute to such misbalance: an inhibitory transmitter $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid, and an excitatory amino acid glutamate. Neuropeptides are powerful modulators of classical neurotransmitters, and thus represent an intriguing tool for restoring the balance between the inhibition and the excitation, through either blocking or activating peptide receptors depending on whether a peptide is pro- or anticonvulsant. Galanin, a 29-amino acid residues neuropeptide which inhibits glutamate release in the hippocampus, is a likely member of the anticonvulsant peptide family. During the past decade growing evidence has been suggesting that galanin is in fact a powerful inhibitor of seizure activity. This review summarizes the state of research of galanin in epilepsy, beginning with the first simple experiments which showed that central injection of galanin agonists inhibited seizures, and that seizures themselves affected galanin signaling in the hippocampus; exploring the impact of active manipulation with the expression of galanin and galanin receptors on seizures, using transgenic animals, antisense and peptide-expressing vector approaches; and concluding with the recent advances in pharmacology, which led to the synthesis of non-peptide galanin receptor agonists with anticonvulsant properties. We also address recently established functions of galanin in seizure-associated neuronal degeneration and neuronal plasticity.",

abstract = "Neuropeptides play an important role in modulating seizures and epilepsy. Unlike neurotransmitters which operate on a millisecond time-scale, neuropeptides have longer half lives; this leads to modulation of neuronal and network activity over prolonged periods, so contributing to setting the seizure threshold. Most neuropeptides are stored in large dense vesicles and co-localize with inhibitory interneurons. They are released upon high frequency stimulation making them attractive targets for modulation of seizures, during which high frequency discharges occur. Numerous neuropeptides have been implicated in epilepsy; one, ACTH, is already used in clinical practice to suppress seizures. Here, we concentrate on neuropeptides that have a direct effect on seizures, and for which therapeutic interventions are being developed. We have thus reviewed the abundant reports that support a role for neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin, ghrelin, somatostatin and dynorphin in suppressing seizures and epileptogenesis, and for tachykinins having pro-epileptic effects. Most in vitro and in vivo studies are performed in hippocampal tissue in which receptor expression is usually high, making translation to other brain areas less clear. We highlight recent therapeutic strategies to treat epilepsy with neuropeptides, which are based on viral vector technology, and outline how such interventions need to be refined in order to address human disease.",

abstract = "Galanin-Like Peptide (GALP) is a hypothalamic neuromediator of metabolism and reproduction. GALP is known to stimulate reproduction and alter food intake and body weight in multiple species. The regulation of body weight involves control of both energy intake and energy expenditure. Since GALP is known to alter food intake - possibly via the autonomic nervous system - we first hypothesized that GALP would increase metabolic rate. First, male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with intracerebroventricular (ICV) cannulae and abdominal radiotelemetry temperature transmitters. Following ICV injection with either 5nmol GALP or vehicle, the oxygen consumption of each rat was monitored for 8h. Food intake, core temperature, and general motor activity were monitored for 24h. GALP significantly increased oxygen consumption, an indirect estimator of metabolic rate, without having any significant effect on motor activity. Compared to controls, GALP increased core body temperature during the photophase and reduced food intake over the 24h period following injection. ICV GALP also increased plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH). A second group of male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with abdominal transmitters and given injections of GALP directly into the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). These injections resulted in a significant reduction in food intake, and a significant increase in both oxygen consumption and core body temperature compared to vehicle injections. Direct injections of GALP into the NTS compared to vehicle also resulted in a significant increase in plasma leptin levels, but not LH levels. GALP appears to increase energy expenditure in addition to decreasing energy input by actions within the NTS and thus may play an important role in the hypothalamic regulation of body weight.",

abstract = "Neurotensin (Nts) is a neuropeptide implicated in the regulation of many facets of physiology, including cardiovascular tone, pain processing, ingestive behaviors, locomotor drive, sleep, addiction and social behaviors. Yet, there is incomplete understanding about how the various populations of Nts neurons distributed throughout the brain mediate such physiology. This knowledge gap largely stemmed from the inability to simultaneously identify Nts cell bodies and manipulate them in vivo. One means of overcoming this obstacle is to study NtsCre mice crossed onto a Cre-inducible green fluorescent reporter line (NtsCre;GFP mice), as these mice permit both visualization and in vivo modulation of specific populations of Nts neurons (using Cre-inducible viral and genetic tools) to reveal their function. Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of the distribution and relative densities of the Nts-GFP populations observed throughout the male NtsCre;GFP mouse brain, which will pave the way for future work to define their physiologic roles. We also compared the distribution of Nts-GFP neurons with Nts-In situ Hybridization (Nts-ISH) data from the adult mouse brain. By comparing these data sets we can distinguish Nts-GFP populations that may only transiently express Nts during development but not in the mature brain, and hence which populations may not be amenable to Cre-mediated manipulation in adult NtsCre;GFP mice. This atlas of Nts-GFP neurons will facilitate future studies using the NtsCre;GFP line to describe the physiological functions of individual Nts populations and how modulating them may be useful to treat disease.",

author = "Chadda, Ritu and Devaud, Leslie L",
abstract = "Social stress is a common occurrence in our society that can negatively impact health. Therefore, we wanted to study the effects of a mild stressor designed to model social stress on seizure susceptibility and GABAA receptors in male and female rats. The mild chronic stress of individual housing consistently decreased bicuculline (but not pentylenetetrazol, PTZ) seizure thresholds by 10-15\% in both sexes. Housing conditions did not alter the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam or ethanol, although the anticonvulsant effect of ethanol was significantly greater against PTZ-induced seizures. Experiments testing the addition of an acute restraint stress unmasked sex differences in seizure induction. The acute stress also selectively decreased the potency of GABA to modulate GABAA receptor-mediated chloride uptake in group-housed females. There were additional sex differences by housing condition for GABAA receptor-gated chloride uptake but no differences in [3H]flunitrazepam binding. We also found significant effects of sex and housing on ethanol-induced increases in corticosterone (CORT) levels. In summary, there were complex and sex-selective effects of mild chronic stress on seizure induction and GABAA receptors. Gaining a better understanding of mechanisms underlying interactions between sex and stress has important implications for addressing health concerns about stress in men and women.",

abstract = "In addition to its initial rewarding effects, cocaine has been shown to produce profound negative/anxiogenic actions. Recent work on the anxiogenic effects of cocaine has examined the role of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), with particular attention paid to the CRF cell bodies resident to the extended amygdala (i.e., the central nucleus of the amygdala [CeA] and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis [BNST]) and the interconnections within and projections outside the region (e.g., to the ventral tegmental area [VTA]). In the current study, localized CRF receptor antagonism was produced by intra-BNST, intra-CeA or intra-VTA application of the CRF antagonists, D-Phe CRF(12-41) or astressin-B. The effect of these treatments were examined in a runway model of i.v. cocaine self-administration that has been shown to be sensitive to both the initial rewarding and delayed anxiogenic effects of the drug in the same animal on the same trial. These dual actions of cocaine are reflected in the development of an approach-avoidance conflict (``retreat behaviors'') about goal box entry that stems from the mixed associations that subjects form about the goal. CRF antagonism within the VTA, but not the CeA or BNST, significantly reduced the frequency of approach-avoidance retreat behaviors while leaving start latencies (an index of the positive incentive properties of cocaine) unaffected. These results suggest that the critical CRF receptors contributing to the anxiogenic state associated with acute cocaine administration may lie outside the extended amygdala, and likely involve CRF projections to the VTA.",

abstract = "The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is involved in behavioral and physiological responses to emotional stress through its action in several limbic structures, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Nevertheless, the role of CRF1 and CRF2 receptors in the BNST in cardiovascular adjustments during aversive threat is unknown. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the involvement of CRF receptors within the BNST in cardiovascular responses evoked by acute restraint stress in rats. For this, we evaluated the effects of bilateral treatment of the BNST with selective agonists and antagonists of either CRF1 or CRF2 receptors in the arterial pressure and heart rate increase and the decrease in tail skin temperature induced by restraint stress. Microinjection of the selective CRF1 receptor antagonist CP376395 into the BNST reduced the pressor and tachycardiac responses caused by restraint. Conversely, BNST treatment with the selective CRF1 receptor agonist CRF increased restraint-evoked arterial pressure and HR responses and reduced the fall in tail skin temperature response. All effects of CRF were inhibited by local BNST pretreatment with CP376395. The selective CRF2 receptor antagonist antisalvagine-30 reduced the arterial pressure increase and the fall in tail skin temperature. The selective CRF2 receptor agonist urocortin-3 increased restraint-evoked pressor and tachycardiac responses and reduced the drop in cutaneous temperature. All effects of urocortin-3 were abolished by local BNST pretreatment with antisalvagine-30. These findings indicate an involvement of both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors in the BNST in cardiovascular adjustments during emotional stress.",

title = "Addressing the burden of epilepsy: Many unmet needs",
author = "Beghi, Ettore",
abstract = "Epilepsy is a heterogeneous clinical condition characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, their causes and complications. The incidence, prevalence and mortality of epilepsy vary with age, place and time contributing to a variable extent to the burden of the disease. Diagnostic misclassification may have strong impact on personal and societal reflections of the disease in light of its clinical manifestations and the need for chronic treatment. Epilepsy accounts for a significant proportion of the world's disease burden ranking fourth after tension-type headache, migraine and Alzheimer disease. Among neurological diseases, it accounts for the highest disability-adjusted life year rates both in men and in women. Although epilepsy is self-remitting in up to 50\% of cases, variable long-term prognostic patterns can be identified based on the response to the available treatments. Epilepsy carries an overall increased risk of premature mortality with variable estimates across countries. Premature mortality predominates in patients aged less than 50 years, with epilepsies due to structural/metabolic conditions, with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures not remitting under treatment. Among deaths directly attributable to epilepsy or seizures, included are sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), status epilepticus, accidents, drowning, unintentional injuries, and suicide. Somatic and psychiatric disorders prevail in patients with epilepsy than in people without epilepsy. Asthma, migraine and cerebral tumors tend to occur more frequently in younger adults while cardiovascular disorders, stroke, dementia and meningioma predominate in the elderly. As being a fairly common clinical condition affecting all ages and requiring long-term (sometimes lifelong) treatment, epilepsy carries high health care costs for the society. Direct costs peak in the first year after diagnosis and then vary according to the severity of the disease, the response to treatment, and the presence of comorbidity. Although in several countries the costs of epilepsy are met by the national health systems, out-of-pocket costs may be a relevant fraction of the overall costs, especially in countries where the public management of health care is suboptimal or non-existent. Epilepsy strongly affects patients' independence, psychological health and emotional adjustment. Epilepsy impairs all aspects of health-related quality of life. Awareness and attitudes of the public about epilepsy may significantly affect the burden of the disease. All these factors add to the burden of the disease. However, many of the factors implicated in the onset of epilepsy, its course and treatment can be favorably addressed with appropriate strategic plans. More research is needed to investigate and manage the medical and psychosocial implications of epilepsy.",

abstract = "Several preclinical and some clinical studies have revealed that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is involved in both genetic and acquired epilepsy syndromes. Excessive activation of mTOR signaling, as a consequence of loss-of-function of genes encoding for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2, is linked to the development of cortical malformations and epilepsy. This mTOR hyperactivation is associated with different epileptogenic conditions under the term of 'mTORopathies' such as tuberous sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly and ganglioglioma. mTOR overactivation produces brain abnormalities that include dysplastic neurons, abnormal cortical organization and astrogliosis. mTOR inhibitors (e.g. rapamycin) have consistent protective effects in various genetic (e.g. TSC models and WAG/Rij rats) and acquired (e.g. kainate or pilocarpine post-status epilepticus) epilepsy animal models. Furthermore, clinical studies in patients with TSC and cortical dysplasia (CD) have confirmed the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitors also in epileptic patients. Therefore, mTOR is currently a very good candidate as a target for epilepsy and epileptogenesis. This review describes the relevance of the mTOR pathway to epileptogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target in epilepsy treatment by presenting the most recent findings on mTOR inhibitors.",

Male rats in the VBS system form a dominance hierarchy, whereby subordinate males exhibit neuroendocrine and physiological profiles characteristic of chronic exposure to stress. We found that social subordination decreases GAD67 mRNA in the peri-paraventricular nucleus region of the hypothalamus and the interfascicular nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and increases in GAD67 mRNA in the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsal medial hypothalamus. Expression of BDNF mRNA increased in the dorsal region of the BNST, but remained unchanged in all other regions examined. Results from this study indicate that social subordination is associated with several region-specific alterations in GAD67 mRNA expression in central stress circuits, whereas changes in the expression of BDNF mRNA are limited to the BNST.",

abstract = "High frequency oscillations (HFO) have a variety of characteristics: band-limited or broad-band, transient burst-like phenomenon or steady-state. HFOs may be encountered under physiological or under pathological conditions (pHFO). Here we review the underlying mechanisms of oscillations, at the level of cells and networks, investigated in a variety of experimental in vitro and in vivo models. Diverse mechanisms are described, from intrinsic membrane oscillations to network processes involving different types of synaptic interactions, gap junctions and ephaptic coupling. HFOs with similar frequency ranges can differ considerably in their physiological mechanisms. The fact that in most cases the combination of intrinsic neuronal membrane oscillations and synaptic circuits are necessary to sustain network oscillations is emphasized. Evidence for pathological HFOs, particularly fast ripples, in experimental models of epilepsy and in human epileptic patients is scrutinized. The underlying mechanisms of fast ripples are examined both in the light of animal observations, in vivo and in vitro, and in epileptic patients, with emphasis on single cell dynamics. Experimental observations and computational modeling have led to hypotheses for these mechanisms, several of which are considered here, namely the role of out-of-phase firing in neuronal clusters, the importance of strong excitatory AMPA-synaptic currents and recurrent inhibitory connectivity in combination with the fast time scales of IPSPs, ephaptic coupling and the contribution of interneuronal coupling through gap junctions. The statistical behaviour of fast ripple events can provide useful information on the underlying mechanism and can help to further improve classification of the diverse forms of HFOs.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is one of the most frequent neurological diseases. In focal medically refractory epilepsies, successful surgical treatment largely depends on the identification of epileptogenic zone. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 80 and 500Hz, which can be recorded with EEG, may be novel markers of the epileptogenic zone. This review discusses the clinical importance of HFOs as markers of epileptogenicity and their application in different types of epilepsies. HFOs are clearly linked to the seizure onset zone, and the surgical removal of regions generating them correlates with a seizure free post-surgical outcome. Moreover, HFOs reflect the seizure-generating capability of the underlying tissue, since they are more frequent after the reduction of antiepileptic drugs. They can be successfully used in pediatric epilepsies such as epileptic spasms and help to understand the generation of this specific type of seizures. While mostly recorded on intracranial EEGs, new studies suggest that identification of HFOs on scalp EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG) is possible as well. Thus not only patients with refractory epilepsies and invasive recordings but all patients might profit from the analysis of HFOs. Despite these promising results, the analysis of HFOs is not a routine clinical procedure; most results are derived from relatively small cohorts of patients and many aspects are not yet fully understood. Thus the review concludes that even if HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptic tissue, there are still uncertainties about mechanisms of generation, methods of analysis, and clinical applicability. Large multicenter prospective studies are needed prior to widespread clinical application.",

abstract = "Both normal, non-epileptic as well as seizure-prone rodents exhibit a spectrum of anxiogenic-like behaviors in response to stressor exposure. Comparative analysis reveals that the same set of emotionality dependent measures is sensitive to both stress reactivity in normal rodents as well as stress hyperreactivity typically seen in seizure-prone rodents. A variety of unconditioned, exploratory tasks reflect global sensitivity to stressor exposure in the form of behavioral inhibition of locomotor output. Moreover, well chosen stressors can trigger de novo seizures with or without a history of seizure incidence. Seizures may be elicited in response to stressful environmental stimuli such as noxious noises, tail suspension handling, or home cage disturbance. Stress reactivity studies in rodents with a genetic predisposition to seizures have yielded important clues regarding brain substrates that mediate seizure ontogeny and modulate ictogenesis. Brains of seizure susceptible rodents reflect elevated content of the stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in several nuclei relative to non-susceptible controls and neutralization of brain CRF attenuates seizure sensitivity. Findings outlined in this review support a diathesis-stress hypothesis in which behavioral- and neuro-pathologies of genetically seizure susceptible rodents arise in part due to multifaceted hyperreactivity to noxious environmental stimuli.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a nodal structure in neural circuits controlling anxiety-related defensive behavioral responses. It contains neurons expressing the stress- and anxiety-related neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) as well as Crh receptors. Repeated daily subthreshold activation of Crh receptors in the BNST is known to induce a chronic anxiety-like state, but how this affects neurotransmitter-relevant gene expression in target regions of the BNST is still unclear. Since the BNST projects heavily to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), the main source of brain serotonin, we here tested the hypothesis that such repeated, anxiety-inducing activation of Crh receptors in the BNST alters the expression of serotonergic genes in the DR, including tph2, the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme for brain serotonin synthesis, and slc6a4, the gene encoding the serotonin transporter (SERT). For 5 days, adult male Wistar rats received daily, bilateral, intra-BNST microinjections of vehicle (1\% bovine serum albumin in 0.9\% saline, n = 11) or behaviorally subthreshold doses of urocortin 1 (Ucn1, n = 11), a potent Crh receptor agonist. Priming with Ucn1 increased tph2 and slc6a4 mRNA expression selectively within the anxiety-related dorsal part of the DR (DRD) and decreased social interaction (SI) time, a measure of anxiety-related defensive behavioral responses in rodents. Decreased social interaction was strongly correlated with increased tph2 mRNA expression in the DRD. Together with previous studies, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that Crh-mediated control of the BNST/DRD-serotonergic system plays a key role in the development of chronic anxiety states, possibly also contributing to stress-induced relapses in drug abuse and addiction behavior.",

abstract = "Conditions of changing steroid hormone levels are a particularly vulnerable time or the manifestation of neurological disorders, including catamenial epilepsy, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and postpartum depression. The pathophysiology of these disorders may be related to changes in neurosteroid levels, which can dramatically impact neuronal excitability. Robust changes in neurosteroid levels, such as those that occur following stress, over the ovarian cycle, and throughout pregnancy, profoundly alter GABAA receptor (GABAAR) structure and function and underlie the associated changes in neuronal excitability. A moderate and brief exposure to elevated neurosteroids, such as those that occur over the ovarian cycle and following an acute stressful episode, result in a decrease in GABAAR $\gamma$2 subunit expression and an increase in GABAAR $\delta$ subunit expression. These changes are accompanied by a decrease in seizure susceptibility and decreased anxiety-like behavior in mice, demonstrating altered neuronal excitability associated with changes in the receptor composition. More robust changes in steroid hormone levels, such as those that occur throughout pregnancy, result in a decrease in both GABAAR $\gamma$2 and $\delta$ subunit expression and are associated with an increase in neuronal excitability evident from the shift in the input-output relationship. Alterations in GABAAR subunit composition may represent a homeostatic mechanism to maintain an ideal level of inhibition in the face of fluctuating neurosteroid levels. Neurosteroids potentiate the effects of GABA on GABAARs, particularly those containing the $\delta$ subunit, and reorganization of these receptors may be necessary to prevent sedation and/or anaesthesia in the face of high levels of neurosteroids or to prevent hyperexcitability in the absence of these compounds. Alterations in GABAARs under conditions of altered steroid hormone levels result in measurable changes in neuronal excitability and dysregulation of GABAARs may play a role in steroid hormone-associated neurological disorders.",

abstract = "Psychiatric disorders associated with elevated stress levels, such as depression, are present in many epilepsy patients, including those with mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (mTLE). Evidence suggests that these psychiatric disorders can predate the onset of epilepsy, suggesting a causal/contributory role. Prolonged exposure to elevated corticosterone, used as a model of chronic stress/depression, accelerates limbic epileptogenesis in the amygdala kindling model. The current study examined whether exposure to repeated stress could similarly accelerate experimental epileptogenesis. Female adult non-epileptic Wistar rats were implanted with a bipolar electrode into the left amygdala, and were randomly assigned into stressed (n=18) or non-stressed (n=19) groups. Rats underwent conventional amygdala kindling (two electrical stimulations per day) until 5 Class V seizures had been experienced ('the fully kindled state'). Stressed rats were exposed to 30min restraint immediately prior to each kindling stimulation, whereas non-stressed rats received control handling. Restraint stress increased circulating corticosterone levels (pre-stress: 122$\pm$17ng/ml; post-stress: 632$\pm$33ng/ml), with no habituation observed over the experiment. Stressed rats reached the 'fully kindled state' in significantly fewer stimulations than non-stressed rats (21$\pm$1 vs 33$\pm$3 stimulations; p=0.022; ANOVA), indicative of a vulnerability to epileptogenesis. Further, seizure durations were significantly longer in stressed rats (p<0.001; ANOVA). These data demonstrate that exposure to repeated experimental stress accelerates the development of limbic epileptogenesis, an effect which may be related to elevated corticosterone levels. This may have implications for understanding the effects of chronic stress and depression in disease onset and progression of mTLE in humans.",

Scn8a mutants display spontaneous spike-wave discharges (SWDs) characteristic of absence epilepsy. We saw that the baseline frequency of SWDs in Scn8a mutants correlates closely with the diurnal activity of the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal (HPA) axis, with a peak in seizure activity occurring at around the same time as the peak in corticosterone (1700--1900 h). A 20-min acute restraint stress administered in the morning increases the frequency of spontaneous SWDs immediately following the stressor. Seizure frequency then returns to baseline levels within 3 h after stressor exposure, but the subsequent evening peak in seizure frequency is delayed and broadened, changes that persist into the next evening and are accompanied by long-lasting changes in HPA axis activity. Scn8a mutants also show increased anxiety-like behavior in mildly stressful situations. A 20-min acute restraint stress can also increase the severity and duration of chemically induced seizures in Scn8a mutants, changes that differ from wild-type littermates. Overall, our data show that a voltage-gated sodium channel mutation can alter the behavioral response to stress and can interact with the stress response to alter seizure outcome.",

author = "Koe, Amelia S and Salzberg, Michael R and Morris, Margaret J and O'Brien, Terence J and Jones, Nigel C",
abstract = "Summary Early life stress causes long-lasting effects on the limbic system that may be relevant to the development of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and its associated psychopathology. Recent studies in rats suggest that maternal separation (MS), a model of early life stress, confers enduring vulnerability to amygdala kindling limbic epileptogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying this remain unknown. Here, we tested whether hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyper-reactivity induced by MS -- specifically the excessive secretion of corticosterone following a seizure -- was involved in this vulnerability. In adult female rats subjected to MS from postnatal days 2--14, seizure-induced corticosterone responses were significantly augmented and prolonged for at least two hours post-seizure, compared to control early-handled (EH) rats. This was accompanied by reduced seizure threshold (p < 0.05) and increased vulnerability to the kindling-induced progression of seizure duration (p < 0.05) in MS rats. Pre-seizure treatment with the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone (MET) (50 mg/kg sc) effectively blocked seizure-induced corticosterone responses. When delivered throughout kindling, MET treatment also reversed the MS-induced reduction in seizure threshold and the lengthened seizure duration back to levels of EH rats. These observations suggest that adverse early life environments induce a vulnerability to kindling epileptogenesis mediated by HPA axis hyper-reactivity, which could have relevance for the pathogenesis of MTLE.",

abstract = "Ample evidence suggests that early life stress (ELS) is a high-risk factor for the development of visceral pain disorders, whereas the mechanism underlying neuronal circuit remains elusive. Herein, we employed neonatal colorectal distension (CRD) to induce visceral hypersensitivity in rats. A combination of electrophysiology, pharmacology, behavioral test, molecular biology, chemogenetics and optogenetics confirmed that CRD in neonatal rats could predispose the elevated firing frequency of the parvocellular corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) in adulthood, with the CRH neurons activated and the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) diminished, both contributing to chronic visceral hypersensitivity. Moreover, following administration of exogenous GABA (300 mM/0.5 $\mu$L) and GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (3 mM/0.5 $\mu$L) in PVN, visceral hyperalgesia was abrogated. In addition, the PVN-projecting GABAergic neurons were mainly distributed in the anterior ventral (AV) region in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), and the excitability of these GABAergic neurons was weakened in visceral hypersensitivity. Specific depletion of the GABAergic neurons in AV region precipitated visceral hyperalgesia. Moreover, chemogenetic activation of the PVN-projecting neurons alleviated the visceral hypersensitivity. Photoactivation of PVN-projecting GABAergic neurons abated the visceral hypersensitivity in neonatal-CRD rats, whereas photoinhibition evoked visceral hyperalgesia in na{\"\i}ve rats. Our findings demonstrated that disinhibition of the PVN-projecting GABAergic neurons in AV region contributed to the excitation of CRH neurons, thereby mediating visceral hypersensitivity. Our study might provide a novel insight into the neuronal circuits involved in the ELS-induced visceral hypersensitivity.",

Seizures lead to increased synthesis, and release of glutamate, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), and other neurotransmitters, and cause extensive activation of microglia at multiple regions in the brain including central autonomic cardiorespiratory brainstem nuclei. Glutamate contributes to neurodegeneration, and inflammation in epilepsy. PACAP has neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties, whereas microglia are key players in inflammatory responses in CNS. Seizure-induced increase in PACAP is neuroprotective. PACAP produces neuroprotective effects acting on microglial PAC1 and VPAC1 receptors. Microglia also express glutamate transporters, and their expression can be increased by PACAP in response to harmful or stressful situations such as seizures. Here we discuss the mechanism of autonomic cardiorespiratory dysfunction in seizure, and the role of PACAP, glutamate and microglia in regulating cardiorespiratory brainstem neurons in their physiological state that could provide future therapeutic options for SUDEP.",

Current treatment for neonatal infection involves antibiotic administration. We previously showed that LPS injected into the trachea of neonatal rats causes changes in breathing and in IL-1$\beta$ expression in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and hypoglossal motor nucleus (XII). We hypothesize that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instilled in the trachea also causes the up-regulation of IL-6 and TNF$\alpha$ in the brainstem autonomic control regions. To test this hypothesis we injected LPS into the trachea of rat pups (postnatal ages 10-12days) and then assessed changes in IL-6 and TNF$\alpha$. Vagal nerve stimulation has been used in the treatment of many inflammatory disorders, including sepsis. Our experiments show that VNS attenuates the upregulation of IL-6 and TNF$\alpha$ caused by LPS and may be a viable alternative to antibiotics.",

Glutamatergic disfacilitation caused large increases in inspiratory and expiratory duration and minor decrease in peak phrenic activity (PPA). Hypoxia only partially reversed respiratory rate depression but PPA was increased to >200\% of control. The contribution of PBN activity to inspiratory and expiratory duration was equal while block of the KF affected inspiratory duration more than expiratory. We conclude that in the in vivo preparation respiratory rate greatly depends on PBN/KF activity, which contributes to the ``inspiratory on- ''and ``off-switch'', but is of minor importance for the magnitude of phrenic motor output.",

METHODS: Five scales related to anxiety, which are part of the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP), were administered pre-operatively and 2-8 years post-operatively to 31 female and 26 male patients. High scores indicate a high degree of anxiety. Seizure outcome was either Engel I or Engel II-IV. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 39 years (S.D. 10). Forty-seven patients had temporal surgery and 10 patients had extra-temporal surgery. The outcome in 34 patients was classified as Engel I and in 23 patients as Engel II-IV. There were statistically significant decreases (paired t test) in t scores for the Somatic Anxiety scale (expected mean 50, from 55.4 to 50.2, P = 0.001) and the Psychic Anxiety scale (expected mean 50, from 56.2 to 51.6, P = 0.006) in patients in Engel I.

After taking baseline imbalances into account (ANCOVA), there were no statistically significant differences in the change in degree of anxiety proneness between patients in the two outcome groups. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing successful epilepsy surgery experienced small decreases in somatic anxiety and psychic anxiety. Since there were important pre-operative imbalances between the two outcome groups, these differences could not be attributed to the effect of seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and nature of self-perceived seizure precipitants in epilepsy patients, and evaluate whether anxiety level, depression, or health locus of control influence self-perception of seizure precipitants. METHODS: Adults aged 18 and older who had epilepsy for at least 1 year were recruited in either the inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit or the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Thomas Jefferson University in 2006. Patients anonymously filled out a questionnaire, which included data about age, sex, education, seizure control, and three questionnaires including identification of seizure precipitants, Hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale, and Form C of the multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC). Discriminant function analysis was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred patients participated, with a mean age of 40.3+/-16 years. One hundred thirty (65\%) patients reported one or more seizure precipitants. Stress (49.5\%), lack of sleep (35.5\%), and fatigue (32.5\%) were the most common seizure triggers reported. Seizure control, anxiety level, and powerful others subscale in HLC scores were significantly related to self-perception of seizure precipitants. Subjective seizure triggers (stress, lack of sleep) were related to psychological factors. CONCLUSIONS: The perception that certain triggers precipitate seizures is related to anxiety, health locus of control, and seizure control. Hence, seizures might be misattributed to irrelevant precipitants because of an underlying psychological predisposition. Alternatively, there may be a physiological relationship between seizures and the triggers. Prospective studies are required to clarify the relationship between seizure precipitants and seizure occurrence.",

Differences in data between groups were compared using t-test. RESULTS: The epilepsy group had a lower mean heart rate interval and a lower high frequency power. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FLE have interictally faster heart rates, attributed to lower parasympathetic drive, which may contribute to the higher incidence of sudden death that is seen in this group of patients.

We also conducted a logistic regression analysis to adjust for possible confounders caused by overrepresentation of patients with Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with Hippocampal Sclerosis (MTLE-HS) in the TLE-FS group. RESULTS: MTLE-HS was overrepresented in patients with TLE-FS (p=0.043). Age at epilepsy onset was lower in patients with TLE-FS (p<0.001). TLE-FS patients had a higher frequency of first grade family members with FS (p=0.003, adjusted for MTLE-HS: p=0.002). They were more frequently plagued with simple partial seizures (p=0.015, adjusted: p=0.038), and especially with vertiginous symptoms (p=0.004 adjusted: p=0.006). They also had the higher frequency of autonomic symptoms (p=0.003; adjusted: p=0.012), and more generalized tonic-clonic seizures (0.034; adjusted p=0.038). CONCLUSION: We identified TLE-FS as a phenotype that can be delineated from other TLE. None of the characteristics are specific, but we disclosed a set of features also when adjusted for MTLE-HS.",

Most SUDEPs occur after one or more seizure(s) during sleep. Nocturnal seizures may go unrecognized. Respiratory depression in the peri-ictal period is one of the primary potential causes of SUDEP. Ictal and postictal apnea is often overlooked because it is not routinely assessed, but appears common and has been a recent focus of SUDEP research. We report a 37 year-old man who had central apnea as the initial manifestation of partial complex seizures associated with oxygen desaturation. This important pathophysiological consequence of a nocturnal complex seizure was identified by respiratory monitoring during a combined video EEG and sleep study.

abstract = "PURPOSE: Cardiac dysfunction is one of the possible causes of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate cardiac and electrocardiographic parameters in rats with audiogenic epileptic seizures (WAR--Wistar audiogenic rats). METHODS: In vivo arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), autonomic tone and electrocardiography (ECG) were measured in awake animals in order to examine cardiac function and rhythm. Ex vivo, the Langendorff technique was used to analyze the cardiac function and the severity of reperfusion arrhythmias. In vitro, confocal microscopy was used to evaluate calcium transient parameters of isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: In vivo autonomic tone evaluation revealed enhanced sympathetic activity, changes in cardiac function with increased systolic arterial pressure and higher basal HR in WAR. In addition, ECG analysis demonstrated electrical alterations with prolongation of the QT interval and QRS complex in these animals. Ex vivo, we observed a decrease in systolic tone and HR and an increase in the duration of ischemia/reperfusion arrhythmias in WAR. Moreover, intracellular Ca2+ handling analysis revealed an increase in the peak of calcium and calcium transient decay in audiogenic rats. Treatment with atenolol ($\beta$1-adrenergic antagonist) normalized the systolic tone, reduced cardiac hypertrophy and the associated increase in the susceptibility to reperfusion arrhythmias observed in WAR. CONCLUSION: We present evidence that chronic disturbances in sympathetic tone in WAR cause increases the risk to life-threatening arrhythmias. Our results support a relationship between seizures, cardiac dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias, which may contribute to the occurrence of SUDEP.",

Long-lasting febrile seizures are frequent in infancy and repeat status epilepticus (SE) has negative prognostic value. Massive myoclonus, rare absences, complex partial seizures and generalized spikes may appear several years later. Myoclonic status may occur in childhood, but acute encephalopathy with febrile SE followed by ischemic lesions and psychomotor impairment, the most severe condition, occurs mainly within the first five years of life. Generalized tonic-clonic and tonic seizures in sleep predominate in adulthood. Non epileptic manifestations appear with age, including intellectual disability, ataxia and crouching gait. Incidence of SUDEP is high, whatever the age. SCN1A haploinsufficiency producing NaV1.1 dysfunction mainly affects GABAergic neurons. In cortical interneurons it explains epilepsy, in cerebellum the ataxia, in basal ganglia and motor neurons the crouching gait, in hypothalamus the thermodysregulation and sleep troubles, and dysfunction in all these structures contributes to psychomotor delay. Valproate, stiripentol, topiramate and bromide are the basis of antiepileptic treatment, whereas inhibitors of sodium channel worsen the condition. Benzodiazepines seem to facilitate acute encephalopathy when given chronically, and they should be restricted to SE. Ketogenic diet is useful in both chronic and acute conditions. Only targeting SCN1A haploinsufficiency and NaV1.1 dysfunction could improve non epileptic manifestations of this condition that deserves being considered as a disease, not only as an epilepsy syndrome.",

author = "McKee, Heather R and Privitera, Michael D",
abstract = "Stress is a common and important seizure precipitant reported by epilepsy patients. Studies to date have used different methodologies to identify relationships between epilepsy and stress. Several studies have identified anxiety, depression, and childhood trauma as being more common in patients with epilepsy who report stress as a seizure precipitant compared to patients with epilepsy who did not identify stress as a seizure precipitant. In one survey study it was found that a majority of patients with stress-triggered seizures had used some type of stress reduction method on their own and, of those who tried this, an even larger majority felt that these methods improved their seizures. Additionally, small to moderate sized prospective trials, including randomized clinical trials, using general stress reduction methods have shown promise in improving outcomes in patients with epilepsy, but results on seizure frequency have been inconsistent. Based on these studies, we recommend that when clinicians encounter patients who report stress as a seizure precipitant, these patients should be screened for a treatable mood disorder. Furthermore, although seizure reduction with stress reduction methods has not been proven in a randomized controlled trial, other important endpoints like quality of life were improved. Therefore, recommending stress reduction methods to patients with epilepsy appears to be a reasonable low risk adjunctive to standard treatments. The current review highlights the need for future research to help further clarify biological mechanisms of the stress-seizure relationship and emphasizes the need for larger randomized controlled trials to help develop evidence based treatment recommendations for our epilepsy patients.",

title = "The role of postictal laboratory blood analyses in the diagnosis and prognosis of seizures",
author = "Nass, Robert D and Sassen, Robert and Elger, Christian E and Surges, Rainer",
abstract = "BACKGROUND: Epileptic seizures (ES) lead to alterations in the blood laboratory values and reflect changes in different organ systems. Here, we review the diagnostic and prognostic value of various blood laboratory values within the context of epilepsy. METHODS: Narrative review and literature search on PubMed using the term, ``seizure'' and various laboratory values. RESULTS: Laboratory markers can help clinicians determine whether an unwitnessed event was more likely to be epileptic or non-epileptic. Prolactin testing helps differentiate ES from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) in adults and adolescents, and is associated with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. Elevations in the creatine kinase (CK) levels are common after generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and display high specificity and moderate sensitivity. Metabolic markers such as ammonia and lactate may have diagnostic potential for postictal blood tests. Analyzing blood postictally is important for identifying the cause of the symptomatic seizures due to endocrine, metabolic, toxic or infectious etiologies. Finally, laboratory analyses are used for identifying patients who are at risk for developing rare, threatening complications such as rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF) or cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Presently, no postictal laboratory values can definitively prove or rule out the diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. For seizures with unknown causes, simple blood tests can be a valuable aid for quickly defining the etiology, particularly with certain metabolic and toxic encephalopathies. For this reason, CK, electrolytes, creatinine, liver and renal function tests should be measured on at least one occasion. Further research is needed in order to identify new biomarkers that improve the diagnosis and prognosis of seizures and seizure-related complications.",

In fact, the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities is relatively high in patients with epilepsy (PWE), as one in three patients will have experienced a psychiatric disorder in the course of their life, with mood and anxiety disorders being the most frequent. Psychiatric comorbidities often precede the onset of the seizure disorder, and affect the life of these patients and the course of the seizure disorder at several levels, including a worse tolerance of pharmacotherapy with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), in particular the development of iatrogenic psychiatric symptoms from pharmacologic and surgical treatments, an increased mortality risk, a worse quality of life and higher economic burdens of the patient, family and society as a hole.

METHODS: We searched articles recording concurrent pre-ictal EEG and HR in adults and children with epilepsy. Pre-ictal HR changes were classified as HR reduction (HRR) or increase (HRI). Studies reporting the total number of seizures and the number of seizures with pre-ictal HR changes were included in a random-effects meta-analysis. A random-effects meta-regression was used to identify variables affecting study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Thirty studies, including 1110 participants and 2957 seizures, were included. The meta-analysis showed a pooled incidence of pre-ictal HRI of 36/100 seizures (95\% CI 22-50). The pre-ictal HRI incidence was 44/100 seizures (95\% CI 33-55) in studies including temporal lobe epilepsy, 55/100 seizures (95\% CI 41-68) in studies enrolling adults and 35/100 seizures (95\% CI 16-58) when patients on antiepileptic drugs were included. The meta-regression showed that the age group, the length of the pre-ictal period, the incidence of ictal tachycardia and the time of onset of the pre-ictal HRI had a significant impact on estimates variability. The pooled incidence of pre-ictal HRR was 0/100 seizures (95\% CI 0-1). CONCLUSION: Review of bias evaluation and methods assessment disclosed several major limitations in the evidence-base.

PGES is considered as a potential risk factor of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) by several studies. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, episodes of generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) were reviewed in regard to state at seizure-onset, the seizure and tonic phase durations, postictal immobility (PI) duration and whether the patient received oxygen (O2) mask during the post-ictal phase. Moreover, the presence and duration of PGES was determined for each seizure. RESULTS: Among 98 episodes of GCSs, 56 (57.1\%) had PGES and 42 (42.9\%) did not have PGES.

The meta-analysis showed a pooled incidence of IH of 35/100 seizures (95\% CI 27-44). Sp02 desaturation threshold was associated with the incidence of IH, with less severe desaturations resulting in higher IH frequencies. The incidence of IH was 41/100 seizures (95\% CI 29-54) for adults and 47/100 seizures (95\% CI 15-78) for tonic-clonic seizures. The meta-regression showed that SpO2 desaturation severity was the sole variable significantly correlated with the incidence of ictal hypoxemia (p = 0.00). CONCLUSION: In a population with refractory epilepsy IH is a frequent phenomenon, especially in adults and in patients presenting with tonic-clonic seizures. The severity of IH appeared independent from the age group and from seizure type and is probably the major clinical concern for its correlation with potentially life-threatening cardiorespiratory alterations and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).",

abstract = "PURPOSE: SUDEP is the first cause of mortality related to epilepsy. However, in Spain there are no published cases or series, neither from epilepsy units nor in the general population that could expose the characteristics of SUDEP in our population. METHOD: We reviewed all patients treated at our Spanish Epilepsy Reference Centre who died between 2010-2018. SUDEP cases were classified as definite, probable, possible or near-SUDEP. Epilepsy type, demographics and case detection issues were described. RESULTS: From 1250 evaluated patients, 102 died during the study period. Seven patients were diagnosed with SUDEP or near-SUDEP: two definite SUDEP, one definite SUDEP plus, two probable SUDEP and two near-SUDEP. Specific problems for detection and registration of SUDEP inherent to the Spanish healthcare system and the legal framework were defined. Only 43\% of cases were known by the referral neurologist. SUDEP incidence was 1.3 per 1000 patient/year, comprising 0.56\% of all deaths in our cohort. Two cases were female, the average age was 36 years (18-61). All patients had focal epilepsy and suffered from generalized tonic-clonic seizures. All witnessed cases occurred after a focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. Four cases occurred during sleep and all non-witnessed cases were found in prone position. One case occurred during video-EEG monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Our casuistic represents the first case series and epidemiological study of SUDEP cases conducted in Spain. The incidence in our population agrees with the reported in other countries. However, in our population, SUDEP is probably underdiagnosed due to administrative and legal issues.",

abstract = "Background Ictal and postictal testing carried out in long-term epilepsy monitoring units is often sub-optimal. Recently, a European consensus protocol for testing patients during and after seizures was developed by a joint taskforce of the International League Against Epilepsy -- Commission on European Affairs and the European Epilepsy Monitoring Unit Association. Aim Using this recently developed standardised assessment battery as a framework, the goal of this narrative review is to outline the proposed testing procedure in detail and explain the rationale for each individual component, focusing on the underlying neurobiology. This is intended to serve as an educational resource for staff working in epilepsy monitoring units. Methods A literature review of PubMed was performed; using the search terms ``seizure'', ``ictal'', ``postictal'', and ``testing'', ``examination'', and ``interview''. Relevant literature was reviewed, and relevant references were chosen. The work is presented as a narrative review. Results The proposed standardised assessment battery provides a comprehensive and user-friendly format for ictal-postictal testing, and examines consciousness, language, motor, sensory, and visual function. Conclusion The standardised approach proposed has the potential to make full use of data recorded during video EEG increasing the diagnostic yield with regards to lateralisation and localisation, aiding both presurgical and diagnostic studies.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: Most patients who die from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) are found in the prone position. We evaluated whether changes in body position occur during generalized convulsive seizures (GCSs). METHOD: GCSs in patients undergoing video-EEG-monitoring between 2007 and 2017 at epilepsy centers in Frankfurt and Marburg were analyzed in relation to changes in body position. RESULTS: A total of 494 GCSs were analyzed among 327 patients. At seizure onset, positions included supine (48.2 \%), right lateral (19.0 \%), left lateral (15.6 \%), sitting or standing (14.0 \%), and prone (3.2 \%). Between seizure onset and the start of generalization, 57.5 \% of participants altered body positions. During four seizures, patients adopted a prone position, while, in five seizures, patients moved from a prone position. Patients who experienced GCS onset while in a nonprone position had a 2.1 \% risk of entering the prone position by the end of their seizure. In contrast, 56.2 \% of those in an initial prone position remained so at the end of the GCS, with an odds ratio for maintaining that position of 60.2 (95 \% confidence interval: 29.1-124.3; p < 0.001). The likelihood of ending up in the prone position post-GCS did not vary among patients with different nonprone starting positions (p = 0.147). CONCLUSIONS: Seizures in prone position occur during sleep and the highest risk for postictal prone positioning appears to be being in the prone position at GCS onset. Epilepsy patients should therefore be advised to go to sleep in a supine or lateral position to reduce their SUDEP risk.",

abstract = "Objective Tissue remodeling has been described in brain circuits that are involved in the generation and propagation of epileptic seizures. Human and animal studies suggest that the anterior piriform cortex (aPC) is crucial for seizure expression in focal epilepsies. Here, we investigate the effect of kainic-acid (KA)-induced seizures on the effective connectivity of the aPC with bilateral hippocampal CA3 regions using cerebro-cerebral evoked potentials (CCEPs). Methods Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a tripolar electrode in the left aPC for stimulation and recording, and with unipolar recording electrodes in bilateral CA3 regions. Single pulse stimulations were given to the aPC and CCEPs were averaged before KA injections and after the emergence of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Similar recordings at equivalent time intervals were obtained from animals that received saline injections instead of KA (controls). Results In the experimental group, the percentage change of increased amplitude of the contralateral (but not ipsilateral) CA3 CCEPs between pre-KA injection and after the emergence of SRS was significantly greater than in controls. No significant single-pulse-induced spectral change responses were observed in either epileptic or control rats when comparing pre- and post-stimulus time intervals. Also, we found no correlation between seizure frequency and the extent of amplitude changes in the CCEPs. Conclusions In the KA model, epileptogenesis results in plastic changes that manifest as an amplification of evoked potential amplitudes recorded in the contralateral hippocampus in response to single-pulse stimulation of the aPC. These results suggest epileptogenesis-induced facilitation of interhemispheric connectivity between the aPC and the hippocampus. Since the amplitude increase of the contralateral CCEP is a possible in vivo biomarker of epilepsy, any intervention (e.g. neuromodulatory) that can reverse this phenomenon may hold a potential antiepileptic efficacy.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To assess the impact of fenfluramine (FFA) on the expected mortality incidence, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), in persons with Dravet syndrome (DS). METHODS: In this pooled analysis, total time of exposure for persons with DS who were treated with FFA in phase 3 clinical trials, in United States and European Early Access Programs, and in two long-term open-label observational studies in Belgium was calculated. Literature was searched for reports of SUDEP mortality in DS, which were utilized as a comparison. Mortality rates were expressed per 1000 person-years. RESULTS: A total of 732 persons with DS were treated with FFA, representing a total of 1185.3 person-years of exposure. Three deaths occurred, all in the phase 3 program: one during placebo treatment (probable SUDEP) and two during treatment with FFA (one probable SUDEP and one definite SUDEP). The all-cause and SUDEP mortality rates during treatment with FFA was 1.7 per 1000 person-years (95\% CI, 0.4 to 6.7), a value lower than the all-cause estimate of 15.8 per 1000 person-years (95\% CI, 9.9 to 25.4) and SUDEP estimate of 9.3 (95\% CI, 5.0 to 17.3) reported by Cooper et al. (Epilepsy Res 2016;128:43-7) for persons with DS receiving standard-of-care. CONCLUSION: All-cause and SUDEP mortality rates in DS patients treated with FFA were substantially lower than in literature reports. Further studies are warranted to confirm that FFA reduces SUDEP risk in DS patients and to better understand the potential mechanism(s) by which FFA lowers SUDEP risk.

The proposed pathophysiological mechanisms for SUDEP include cardio-respiratory dysfunctions, brainstem arousal system impairment, and dysregulation in the neurotransmitter/neuromodulator systems. This narrative review provides an overview of primary research on SUDEP in paediatric populations. Some studies report an incidence of paediatric SUDEP which is about five times lower than in adults (between 0.02 and 0,34 per 1,000 person-years) even if more recent studies suggested similar incidence rates than in adulthood (between 1.20 / 1,000 and 1.45 / 1,000 person per years). Risk factors for SUDEP in children include genetic predisposition, neurological comorbidities, epilepsy phenotype, adequacy/adherence to treatment, adequate supervision by caregivers and access to adequate health care support. The early identification of risk factors, the definition of reliable biomarkers and the building of efficacious preventive strategies, including parental/caregiver counselling, novel technological devices, and pharmacological treatments, may reduce the risk of paediatric SUDEP.",

Multiple methods for assessing dysautonomia have been reported; however, the patient characteristics and epilepsy features that drive any method selection are unclear. People with epilepsy (PWE) can experience sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and one reason can be dysautonomia. If dysautonomia can be detected in PWE before a severe event, then it could complement and redirect patient treatment and monitoring. Objective To map the available literature on dysautonomia in PWE and describe patients' characteristics and methods used to evaluate dysautonomia. Methods We performed a scoping literature review. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and hand searched starting from the first registry in the literature until August 2019. Studies were independently assessed by three authors and two epileptologists. We present data in tables and summarize information according to the following structure: population, concepts, and context. Results Thirty-five studies were included in the analysis with epidemiological designs including case reports (23), cross-sectional studies (4), case-controls (7), and cohort studies (1). A total of 618 patients were enrolled. Heart rate variability, arrhythmia, blood pressure, the tilt-table test, polysomnography, respiratory function, and magnetic resonance imaging were the methods most commonly used to assess dysautonomia in PWE. A detailed description of the heart rate variability assessment is presented. Conclusions This review provides a broad description of the available literature identifying clinical findings, the most frequently reported assessment measurements of dysautonomia, in temporal lobe epilepsy and extratemporal epilepsies.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related deaths in children and adults with epilepsy. The incidence of SUDEP in children and adults is equal, approximately 1.2 per 1000-person years. Although inroads have been made in our understanding of SUDEP, its pathophysiology remains unknown. The most important risk factor for SUDEP is the presence of tonic-clonic seizures. Recently there has been growing interest in the contribution of genetic risk factors to SUDEP deaths. Pathogenic variants in epilepsy-related and cardiac genes have been found in some cases of SUDEP post-mortem. Pleiotropy may occur in which a single gene when altered may cause multiple phenotypes (i.e., epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia). Recently it has been shown that some developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) may also be at heightened risk of SUDEP. In addition, polygenic risk has been postulated to effect SUDEP risk with current models evaluating the additive effect of variants in multiple genes. However, the mechanisms underpinning polygenic risk in SUDEP are likely more complex than this. Some preliminary studies also highlight the feasibility of detecting genetic variants in brain tissue post-mortem. Despite the advances in the field of SUDEP genetics, the use of molecular autopsy remains underutilized in SUDEP cases. Several challenges exist concerning genetic testing post-mortem in SUDEP cases, such as interpretation, cost of testing, and availability. In this focused review, we highlight the current landscape of genetic testing in SUDEP cases, its challenges, and future directions.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Most cases of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) follow a seizure, and most deaths occur while people are in bed, presumably sleeping. Nocturnal seizures are reported to be a risk factor for SUDEP. People with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) have seizures predominantly or exclusively during sleep, often many times per night. The present study aimed to assess whether NFLE represents a high-risk condition for SUDEP. METHODS: The present study retrospectively assessed the incidence of SUDEP in a cohort reconstructed from a dedicated database of consecutive patients referred to the Epilepsy and Sleep Centres of the Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna from 1980 to 2012 with: (1) a diagnosis of NFLE, (2) at least 90\% of seizures during sleep, and (3) at least one-year of follow-up. RESULTS: One hundred and three people were included. The median time from seizure onset to last observation was 26 years, equal to a follow-up of 2789 person-years. One person died of SUDEP during the follow-up period. The incidence rate of SUDEP was 0.36 per 1000 person-years (95\% CI 0.01 to 2.0). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SUDEP in the participant population was not higher than the rates previously reported in prevalent epilepsy populations (0.4 to 2.3 per 1000 person-years). The low prevalence of SUDEP might reflect the low occurrence of generalised tonic-clonic seizures in people with NFLE.",

Animal models have revealed that the mechanisms of SUDEP involve initially a primary event, often a seizure of sufficient type and severity, that occurs in a brain, which is vulnerable to SUDEP due to either genetic or antecedent factors. This primary event initiates a cascade of secondary events starting, as some models indicate, with cortical spreading depolarization that propagates to the brainstem where it results in autonomic dysfunction. Intrinsic abnormalities in brainstem serotonin, adenosine, sodium-postassium ATPase, and respiratory-control systems are also important. The tertiary event, which results from the above dysfunction, consists of either lethal central apnea, pulmonary edema, or arrhythmia.

We generated DS patient and control induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (iPSC-CMs). We observed increased sodium current (INa) and spontaneous contraction rates in DS patient iPSC-CMs versus controls. For the subject with the largest increase in INa, cardiac abnormalities were revealed upon clinical evaluation. Generation of a CRISPR gene-edited heterozygous SCN1A deletion in control iPSCs increased INa density in iPSC-CMs similar to that seen in patient cells. Thus, the high risk of SUDEP in DS may result from a predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias in addition to seizures, reflecting expression of SCN1A in heart and brain.",

abstract = "As a crucial component of brain innate immunity, neuroinflammation initially contributes to neuronal tissue repair and maintenance. However, chronic inflammatory processes within the brain and associated blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment often cause neurotoxicity and hyperexcitability. Mounting evidence points to a mutual facilitation between inflammation and epilepsy, suggesting that blocking the undesired inflammatory signaling within the brain might provide novel strategies to treat seizures and epilepsy. Neuroinflammation is primarily characterized by the upregulation of proinflammatory mediators in epileptogenic foci, among which cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) have been extensively studied. Small molecules that specifically target these key proinflammatory perpetrators have been evaluated for antiepileptic and antiepileptogenic effects in animal models. These important preclinical studies provide new insights into the regulation of inflammation in epileptic brains and guide drug discovery efforts aimed at developing novel anti-inflammatory therapies for seizures and epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy with periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) lacks a conclusive surgical treatment strategy as eloquent cortex and important white matter tracts frequently overlay the deep periventricular nodules. Our goal was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for the treatment of epilepsy in PVNH. METHODS: Data on demographic characteristics, complications, visual outcomes, Engel classification at last follow-up, antiepileptic drug use, morbidity, and mortality among patients who underwent this procedure were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Between May 2015 and January 2019, 5 patients underwent 6 LITT procedures for epilepsy with PVNH. One patient had residual nodules after their first procedure and underwent a second ablation. The average follow-up time was 12 months. Three patients were Engel class Ia, 1 patient was Engel class II, and 1 patient was Engel class III at last follow-up. Two patients were able to reduce their antiepileptic drugs postoperatively. Three patients had no changes in vision, 1 patient experienced a quadrantanopsia, and 1 patient had subjective blurry vision after their procedures. No patients experienced motor deficits, dysphasia, infection, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: LITT appears to be a safe and promising option to provide seizure relief for patients with refractory epilepsy and PVNH that otherwise may not be surgical candidates. Some appropriately determined patients with refractory epilepsy may benefit from LITT before proceeding with an invasive intracranial evaluation. A larger sample size and long-term follow-up is necessary to further elucidate safety and efficacy.",

Whereas the relationship between epilepsy and depression has received much attention, less is known about anxiety disorders. It is now recognized that anxiety can have a profound influence on the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. The relationship between anxiety disorders and epilepsy is complex. It is necessary to distinguish between different manifestations of anxiety disorder: ictal, postictal, and interictal anxiety. Preexisting vulnerability factors, neurobiological factors, iatrogenic influences (antiepileptic drugs, epilepsy surgery), and psychosocial factors are all likely to play a role, but with considerable individual differences. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders in patients with epilepsy, there are no systematic treatment studies or evidence-based guidelines for best treatment practice.

abstract = "A broad spectrum of learning/memory, social interaction, and affective behavioral measures serve as functional correlates for neurobiological changes in seizure-prone animals as well as in epileptic clinical populations. The utility of such measures is demonstrated by their ability to distinguish anomalous characteristics in developing organisms predisposed to seizure onset, as well as to discriminate prior seizure history in organisms with established pathology. For instance, typical findings that generalize across species suggest that seizure-experienced organisms exhibit a variety of deficits in cognitive function as well as inappropriate social neglect and aggression. Behavioral testing batteries have also proven useful in assessing neural mechanisms for seizure induction, subcortical neural circuits, and neuropeptide modulators, for example, as well as in identifying neural pathology resulting from prior seizure activity. However, the wanton application of behavioral tests can also produce false positives in the identification of seizure-related disorders unless alternative performance and motivational hypotheses are discounted effectively. Accordingly, the present review attempts to provide the reader interested in behavioral phenotyping and characterization of seizure-prone rats and mice with a roadmap for rational selection, implementation, and interpretation of data from behavior assays while highlighting potential successes and pitfalls inherent in employing functional correlates of brain activity using animal models of epilepsy.",

The contribution of deaths unrelated to epilepsy to this risk is likely to be significant. Recent studies indicate that comorbid conditions are similarly increased in PWE. The reason for these increases in unrelated deaths and comorbid conditions is unclear. In this article, we argue that having seizures is psychologically stressful, and that this stress can lead to a whole range of pathophysiological changes that may trigger various physical illnesses. Hence, psychological stress may be a significant factor contributing to the increase in mortality and comorbidity rates in PWE. This speculation is unlikely to be proven at this stage because of the complexity of the trials required. In PWE who continue to have seizures, more needs to be done to help them cope with the stress. Additionally, attention needs to be paid to improve nutritional status and physical fitness. These steps are likely to enhance the overall health of PWE and may reduce premature mortality and comorbidity rates.",

abstract = "Nasal obstruction and consequent mouth breathing have been shown to change the acid-base balance, producing respiratory acidosis. Additionally, there exists a large body of evidence maintaining that acidosis affects the activity of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels, which play a crucial role in the function of the central nervous system (CNS), for example, in modulating seizure threshold. Thus, in the study described here, we examined whether mouth breathing, induced by surgical ligation of nostrils, could affect the seizure threshold induced by pentylenetetrazole in male NMRI mice. Using the selective K(ATP) channel opener (diazoxide) and blocker (glibenclamide), we also evaluated the possible role of K(ATP) channels in this process. Our data revealed that seizure threshold was increased 6 to 72 hours after nasal obstruction, reaching a peak 48 hours afterward, compared with either control or sham-operated mice (P<0.01). There was a significant decrease in pH of arterial blood samples and increase in CO(2) partial pressure (PCO(2)) during this time. Systemic injection of glibenclamide (1 and 2mg/kg, ip, daily) significantly prevented the increase in seizure threshold in 48-hour bilaterally nasally obstructed mice, whereas it had no effect on seizure threshold in sham-operated mice. Systemic injection of diazoxide (25mg/kg, ip, daily) had no effect on seizure threshold in all groups, whereas higher doses (50 and 100mg/kg, ip, daily) significantly increased seizure threshold in both 48-hour-obstructed and sham-operated mice. The decrease in seizure threshold induced by glibenclamide (2mg/kg, ip, daily) was prevented by diazoxide (25mg/kg, ip, daily). These results demonstrate for the first time that mouth breathing, which could result in respiratory acidosis, increases seizure threshold in mice and K(ATP) channels may play a role in this effect.",

abstract = "Virtually all mammals, including humans, exhibit neurogenesis throughout life in the hippocampus, a learning and memory center in the brain. Numerous studies in animal models imply that hippocampal neurogenesis is important for functions such as learning, memory, and mood. Interestingly, hippocampal neurogenesis is very sensitive to physiological and pathological stimuli. Certain pathological stimuli such as seizures alter both the amount and the pattern of neurogenesis, though the overall effect depends on the type of seizures. Acute seizures are classically associated with augmentation of neurogenesis and migration of newly born neurons into ectopic regions such as the hilus and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Additional studies suggest that abnormally migrated newly born neurons play a role in the occurrence of epileptogenic hippocampal circuitry characteristically seen after acute seizures, status epilepticus, or head injury. Recurrent spontaneous seizures such as those typically observed in chronic temporal lobe epilepsy are associated with substantially reduced neurogenesis, which, interestingly, coexists with learning and memory impairments and depression. In this review, we discuss both the extent and the potential implications of abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis induced by acute seizures as well as recurrent spontaneous seizures. We also discuss the consequences of chronic spontaneous seizures on differentiation of neural stem cell progeny in the hippocampus and strategies that are potentially useful for normalizing neurogenesis in chronic temporal lobe epilepsy.",

Reevaluation of the extent of the pathology, as well as new data from animal models, suggests that the seizure focus extends, at least in some cases, beyond the hippocampus and amygdala, which are usually removed at the time of surgery. In this review, we examine current information about the pathology and physiology of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome, with special emphasis on the distribution of the changes and patterns of seizure onset.

Seventeen risk factors were identified, each given a value according to the number of studies in the literature that specified that condition as a significant risk. The addition of these 17 values then indicated the risk for a given patient. The author calculated these for a group of 91 patients who died of SUDEP and also for 91 live patients. Many of their values for the different risks were significantly different. The sensitivity of these SUDEP values was 71.3\%, the specificity 81.8\%, and the positive predictive value 84.6\%. A discussion includes the question of whether the death in SUDEP is primarily cardiac or pulmonary and the suggestion that it may be either or both in a given patient.

Observations of pulmonary compromise in near-miss patients are extremely rare.

abstract = "Variations in the plasma concentration of levetiracetam during pregnancy and postpartum were prospectively monitored in five women to investigate their potential implications in epilepsy management and child outcome. Under unchanged levetiracetam dosages, the mean concentrations of levetiracetam during the third trimester were 62\% of the baseline late (12 month) postpartum levels, but only 47\% of the baseline early postpartum (2 month) levetiracetam levels. In dual therapy with lamotrigine, baseline late postpartum levetiracetam clearance was 63.2\%, whereas in early postpartum it was 45\% of the maximal second-trimester clearance. However, the number of seizures remained unchanged once lamotrigine dose was increased. No woman had adverse effects during the puerperium. The mean umbilical cord/maternal plasma concentration ratio was 1.21. None of the newborns had malformations, with the anthropometric data being normal for their gestational age. The decline in gestational levetiracetam plasma concentration does not seem to be hazardous, but differs according to whether early or late postpartum levels are chosen as baseline levels.",

LEV caused fewer adverse events than the other AEDs. PB produced persistent negative cognitive side effects. LEV was associated with improved cognitive performance, specifically attention level and oral fluency items. LTG had a better effect on mood. LEV had a benign neuropsychological side effect profile, making it a cognitively safe drug to use for controlling established seizures in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

In DBA/1 mice, audiogenic seizures induced by acoustic stimulation resulted in generalized convulsive seizures followed by respiratory arrest from postnatal day (PND) 21 to 100. The incidence of respiratory arrest susceptibility increased, reaching approximately 90-100\% by three to seven daily seizures when testing began on PND 21-30. Respiratory arrest was reversible with resuscitation in approximately 98\% of mice, which allows repeated seizure testing. Electrocardiographic activity in DBA/1 mice was detectable for approximately 4-6 minutes after respiratory arrest, indicating that death is likely due to respiratory cessation, as cardiac changes occur later. These findings suggest that DBA/1 mice are a useful chronic SUDEP model. These mice die suddenly from respiratory arrest after generalized convulsive seizures until reaching PND >or=100, allowing testing of chronic preventive treatments for SUDEP.",

Fear memory formation did not change 1 day and 2 weeks after the onset of SE, but was significantly reduced after 6 weeks. Induction of LTP was enhanced 1 day after the onset of SE, but returned to the normal level 2 weeks later, and was almost completely attenuated after 6 weeks. The enhancement of LTP was accompanied by an increase in output responses of excitatory postsynaptic potentials, whereas suppression of LTP was accompanied by alteration of the ratio of paired pulse facilitation. These results indicate that time-dependent changes of LTP induction have a causal role in the development of learning deficits of epilepsy patients.",

Serotonin (5-HT) normally enhances respiration in response to elevated CO(2) levels, which occur during GCSs in humans. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine, increase 5-HT availability. We examined whether fluoxetine can block GCS-induced sudden death in DBA/1 mice. Fluoxetine (15-70 mg/kg ip) was administered acutely with seizure induction at 30minutes or semichronically in five daily doses (20mg/kg/day) with induction after 5 days. Acute fluoxetine (45 or 70 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence of RA without blocking seizure susceptibility. Semichronic fluoxetine did not block seizures, but significantly reduced seizure-induced RA, which is consistent with effects of SSRIs on respiration in patients with epilepsy [Bateman LM, Li DS,LiN TC, Seyal M.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to synopsize the evidence on predictors of crashes and driving status in people with epilepsy (PWE). METHODS: Evidence-based review of the published English literature was the method used. We searched various databases and extracted data from 16 (of 77) primary studies. On the basis of American Academy of Neurology criteria, we assigned each study a class of evidence (I-IV, where I indicates the highest level of evidence) and made recommendations (Level A: predictive or not; Level B: probably predictive or not; Level C: possibly predictive or not; Level U: no recommendations). RESULTS: For PWE, the following characteristics are considered useful: For identifying crash risk, epilepsy (level B) and short seizure-free intervals ($\geq$3 months) (Level C) are not predictive of motor vehicle crash (MVC). For self/proxy-reported crash risk, epilepsy surgery (Level B), seizure-free intervals (6-12 months) (Level B), few prior non-seizure-related crashes (Level B), and regular antiepileptic drug adjustments (Level B) are protective against crashes; seizures contribute to MVCs (Level C); mandatory reporting does not contribute to reduced crashes (Level C). No recommendations for reliable auras, age, and gender (Level U), as data are inadequate to make determinations. For self-reported driving or licensure status, employment and epilepsy surgery are predictive of driving (Level C); there are no recommendations for antiepileptic drug use, self-reported driving, gender, age, receiving employment benefits, or having reduced seizure frequency (Level U). CONCLUSION: Limitations, that is, heterogeneity among studies, examining the English literature from 1994 to 2010, must be considered. Yet, this is the first evidence-based review to synopsize the current PWE and driving literature and to provide recommendation(s) to clinicians and policy makers. Class I studies, matched for age and gender, yielding Level A recommendations are urgently needed to define the risks, benefits, and causal factors underlying driving performance issues in PWE.",

abstract = "Psychiatric complaints afflict many patients with epilepsy, and these contribute significantly to the impaired quality of life experienced by sufferers of this common group of neurological conditions. Psychiatric disorders in epilepsy patients are under-diagnosed and under-treated. Moreover, evidence suggests that the psychiatric disorders may act as risk factors for some types of epilepsy and exacerbate disease progression in established cases, promoting the case for a bidirectional relationship between epilepsy and psychopathology. While cause and effect relationships can be difficult to establish in human studies, appropriate animal models provide valuable tools with which to study the interactions between epilepsy and stress‐related disorders. Indeed, many epilepsy models exhibit behavioral phenotypes which are reflective of psychiatric disorders, and, conversely, stressful environments appear to promote a vulnerability to developing epilepsy. This review summarizes this research area, exploring the behavioral phenotypes in animal models of epilepsy and then examining the influence of stressful environments on susceptibility to seizures and epilepsy. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to be able to translate these findings to humans. Understanding the relationships between epilepsy and associated psychiatric disorders will facilitate effective treatment of mood disorders in epilepsy, inform about the pathophysiology of each individually, and potentially open up novel therapeutic disease‐modifying strategies for patients with epilepsy.

author = "Petrovski, Slav{\'e} and Kwan, Patrick",
abstract = "With no known intervention to prevent or cure epilepsy, treatment is primarily symptomatic and requires long-term administration of medications to suppress seizure occurrence. Current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are ineffective in one-third of patients (Kwan and Brodie, 2000). Such therapeutic inadequacy is largely due to our insufficient understanding of the basic molecular pathophysiological processes that underlie epileptogenesis. Breakthroughs are needed in the identification of new molecular targets that will translate to novel intervention approaches. Discovering genetic variants that increase the susceptibility to disease is a promising avenue to identifying such targets. However, early candidate gene-based studies in epilepsy proved ineffective in identifying genetic risk factors for the non-Mendelian, complex epilepsies, which represent >95\% of clinically encountered epilepsy. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of epilepsy patients have been largely negative, with the exception of several putative susceptibility loci discovered in Han Chinese focal epilepsy and European Caucasian GGE patients (Kasperaviciute et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2012; Consortium et al., 2012). Results of these GWAS suggest that, similar to other common diseases, associations with common single nucleotide variants (SNV) appear likely to account for a small fraction of the heritability of epilepsy, thus fuelling the effort to also search for alternative genetic contributors, with a recent increased emphasis on rare variants with larger effects (Manolio et al., 2009). It is possible that both common and rare variants contribute to an increased susceptibility to common epilepsy syndromes (Mulley et al., 2005). We review the approaches that have been taken to identify genetic risk markers of the common epilepsy syndromes, the experimental platforms, and their caveats. We discuss current technologies and analytical frameworks that might expedite the discovery of these variants by leveraging advances in microarray-based, high-throughput, genotyping technology, and complementary interdisciplinary expertise of study teams including the need for meta-analyses under global collaborative frameworks. We briefly discuss the analytical options made available through rapid advances in sequencing and other genomic technologies.",

The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, but seizure-induced cardiac and respiratory arrests are involved. The cardiovascular and respiratory systems are subject to precise reflex regulation to ensure appropriate oxygen supply under a wide range of circumstances. Barosensory and chemosensory afferents project into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), which relays systemic data to higher brain centers for integration of homeostatic responses in heart rate, peripheral resistance, respiration, and other autonomic reactions. Being the afferent autonomic gatekeeper, NTS plays a critical role in cardiovascular and respiratory regulation. In the course of studying the kainic acid model, we became aware of progressive neuronal loss in the NTS and noted SUDEP-like deaths in rats with frequent convulsions. Increased autonomic susceptibility with inhalation anesthetics was also observed, often seen after impairment of baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflex loops. Seizure-induced neuron loss in NTS may play a role impairing the integrative functions of NTS resulting in poor homeostatic responses during seizures and leading to SUDEP.",

The overlap of psychiatric comorbidity adds to the challenge of optimal treatment for people with epilepsy. Seizure episodes themselves may have varying triggers; however, for decades, stress has been commonly and consistently suspected to be a trigger for seizure events. This paper explores the relationship between stress and seizures and reviews clinical data as well as animal studies that increasingly corroborate the impact of stress hormones on neuronal excitability and seizure susceptibility. The basis for enthusiasm for targeting glucocorticoid receptors for the treatment of epilepsy and the mixed results of such treatment efforts are reviewed. In addition, this paper will highlight recent findings identifying a regulatory pathway controlling the body's physiological response to stress which represents a novel therapeutic target for modulation of the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal (HPA) axis. Thus, the HPA axis may have important clinical implications for seizure control and imply use of anticonvulsants that influence this neuronal pathway.

Yet, antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) family not only have been shown to be safe when used in patients with epilepsy (PWE) but also have been found to possess antiepileptic properties in animal models of epilepsy. In humans randomized to SSRIs vs. placebo for the treatment of major depressive episodes, the incidence of epileptic seizures was significantly lower among those treated with the antidepressants. These data raise the question of whether there is enough evidence that would support a randomized placebo-controlled trial to test antiepileptic effect of SSRIs in PWE.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: There are few prospective studies on the causes of mortality in well-characterized cohorts with epilepsy and even fewer that have autopsy data that allow for reliable determination of SUDEP. We report causes of mortality and mortality rates in the Finnish cohort with childhood-onset epilepsy. METHODS: A population-based cohort of 245 children with epilepsy in 1964 has been prospectively followed for almost 40 years. Seizure outcomes and mortality were assessed. Autopsy data were available in 70\% of the cases. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) rates were assessed, and SUDEP was confirmed by autopsy. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 60 subjects died. The major risk factor for mortality was lack of terminal remission (p < 0.0001). Remote symptomatic etiology also increased the risk for death (p < 0.0001) but did not remain significant on multivariate analysis after adjusting for effect of remission. Of the deaths, 33/60 (55\%) were epilepsy-related including SUDEP in 23/60 (38\%) using the Nashef criteria, status epilepticus in 4/60 (7\%), and accidental drowning in 6/60 (10\%). The nonepilepsy-related deaths occurred primarily in the remote symptomatic group and were often related to the underlying disorder or to medical comorbidities that developed after the onset of the epilepsy. Risk factors for SUDEP on multivariable analysis included lack of 5-year terminal remission and not having a localization-related epilepsy. In cryptogenic/idiopathic cases, SUDEP did not occur in childhood but begins only in adolescence. CONCLUSION: Childhood-onset epilepsy is associated with a substantial risk of epilepsy-related mortality, primarily SUDEP. In otherwise neurologically normal individuals, the increased SUDEP risk begins in adolescence. The higher mortality rates reported in this cohort are related to duration of follow-up as most of the mortality occurs many years after the onset of the epilepsy.",

Here, we present a possible experimental protocol to study drug effects and physiopathogenesis of psychiatric comorbidity in epileptic animals. Pentylentetrazol-kindled animals were subjected to the chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure; furthermore, we tested the effects of chronic lamotrigine treatment on the development of comorbidity. We found that epileptic-depressed animals showed more pronounced behavioral alterations in comparison to other mice groups, indicating that kindled animals develop more pronounced CMS-induced behavioral alterations than nonepileptic mice; lamotrigine was able to prevent the development of comorbidities such as anxiety, depression-like behavior, and memory impairment.",

Mechanisms of epilepsy--ADHD comorbidity remain largely unknown. We investigated whether a model of chronic epilepsy in rats produces signs of ADHD, and thus, whether it can be used for studying mechanisms of this comorbidity. Epilepsy was induced in male Wistar rats via pilocarpine status epilepticus. Half of the animals exhibited chronic ADHD-like abnormalities, particularly increased impulsivity and diminished attention in the lateralized reaction-time task. These impairments correlated with the suppressed noradrenergic transmission in locus coeruleus outputs. The other half of animals exhibited depressive behavior in the forced swimming test congruently with the diminished serotonergic transmission in raphe nucleus outputs. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depressive behavior appeared mutually exclusive. Therefore, the pilocarpine model of epilepsy affords a system for reproducing and studying mechanisms of comorbidity between epilepsy and both ADHD and/or depression.",

title = "Emergence of semiology in epileptic seizures",
author = "Chauvel, Patrick and McGonigal, Aileen",
abstract = "Semiology, the manifestation of epilepsy, is dependent upon electrical activity produced by epileptic seizures that are organized within existing neural pathways. Clinical signs evolve as the epileptic discharge spreads in both time and space. Studying the relation between these, of which the temporal component is at least as important as the spatial one, is possible using anatomo-electro-clinical correlations of stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data. The period of semiology production occurs with variable time lag after seizure onset and signs then emerge more or less rapidly depending on seizure type (temporal seizures generally propagating more slowly and frontal seizures more quickly). The subset of structures involved in semiological production, the ``early spread network'', is tightly linked to those constituting the epileptogenic zone. The level of complexity of semiological features varies according to the degree of involvement of the primary or associative cortex, with the former having a direct relation to peripheral sensory and motor systems with production of hallucinations (visual and auditory) or elementary sensorimotor signs. Depending on propagation pattern, these signs can occur in a ``march'' fashion as described by Jackson. On the other hand, seizures involving the associative cortex, having a less direct relation with the peripheral nervous system, and necessarily involving more widely distributed networks manifest with altered cognitive and/or behavioral signs whose neural substrate involves a network of cortical structures, as has been observed for normal cognitive processes. Other than the anatomical localization of these structures, the frequency of the discharge is a crucial determinant of semiological effect since a fast (gamma) discharge will tend to deactivate normal function, whereas a slower theta discharge can mimic physiological function. In terms of interaction between structures, the degree of synchronization plays a key role in clinical expression, as evidenced, for example, by studies of ictal fear-related behavior (decorrelation of activity between structures inducing ``release'' phenomena) and of d{\'e}j{\`a} vu (increased synchronization). Studies of functional coupling within networks underlying complex ictal behavior indicate that the clinical semiology of a given seizure depends upon neither the anatomical origin of ictal discharge nor the target areas of its propagation alone but on the dynamic interaction between these. Careful mapping of the ictal network in its full spread offers essential information as to the localization of seizure onset, by deducing that a given network configuration could only be generated by a given area or group of areas.",

We aimed to determine the prevalence of state and trait anxiety in patients with epilepsy compared with people without epilepsy. METHODS: We recruited patients and healthy controls in the outpatient neurology clinic of Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, during 2011. Eighty-four patients with epilepsy and 168 healthy persons from relatives of the patients in the case group were recruited and filled out the inventory. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure anxiety. After selection of participants and neurological evaluation, all subjects were clinically interviewed at the outpatient clinic of neurology. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 16. Fisher's exact and chi-square tests were used for nominal variables, and the t-test was used for anxiety scores. RESULTS: The average ages of the patients in the case and control groups were 28 and 27.5 years, respectively. State anxiety was significantly higher in patients with epilepsy than in the control group (p=0.042). Also, a higher trait anxiety score was reported in the case group compared with the control group (p=0.009). CONCLUSION: The rates of both state and trait anxiety were higher in patients in the case group. It appears that anxiety in epilepsy is not just a reaction to a stressful situation, and there may be genetic or temperamental factors that contribute to the relationship between epilepsy and anxiety.",

We conducted a retrospective review of 57 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy who underwent intracranial electrode implantation and ESM. Stimulation-evoked seizures (afterdischarges associated with clinical signs or symptoms) occurred in 19 patients (33\%). Mapping sessions were disrupted for 11 of these patients (i.e., 19\% of the full sample and 58\% of the subgroup of patients with stimulation-evoked seizures).

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate long-term atrophy in contralateral hippocampal volume after surgery for unilateral MTLE, as well as the cognitive outcome for patients submitted to either selective transsylvian amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) or anterior temporal lobe resection (ATL). METHODS: We performed a longitudinal study of 47 patients with MRI signs of unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (23 patients with right-sided hippocampal sclerosis) who underwent surgical treatment for MTLE. They underwent preoperative/postoperative high-resolution MRI as well as neuropsychological assessment for memory and estimated IQ. To investigate possible changes in the contralateral hippocampus of patients, we included 28 controls who underwent two MRIs at long-term intervals. RESULTS: The volumetry using preoperative MRI showed significant hippocampal atrophy ipsilateral to the side of surgery when compared with controls (p<0.0001) but no differences in contralateral hippocampal volumes. The mean postoperative follow-up was 8.7 years ($\pm$ 2.5 SD; median=8.0). Our patients were classified as Engel I (80\%), Engel II (18.2\%), and Engel III (1.8\%). We observed a small but significant reduction in the contralateral hippocampus of patients but no volume changes in controls. Most of the patients presented small declines in both estimated IQ and memory, which were more pronounced in patients with left TLE and in those with persistent seizures. Different surgical approaches did not impose differences in seizure control or in cognitive outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We observed small declines in cognitive scores with most of these patients, which were worse in patients with left-sided resection and in those who continued to suffer from postoperative seizures. We also demonstrated that manual volumetry can reveal a reduction in volume in the contralateral hippocampus, although this change was mild and could not be detected by visual analysis. These new findings suggest that dynamic processes continue to act after the removal of the hippocampus, and further studies with larger groups may help in understanding the underlying mechanisms.",

The electrode whose stimulation disrupted consciousness was between the left claustrum and anterior-dorsal insula. Stimulation of electrodes within 5mm did not affect consciousness. We studied the interdependencies among depth recording signals as a function of time by nonlinear regression analysis (h(2) coefficient) during stimulations that altered consciousness and stimulations of the same electrode at lower current intensities that were asymptomatic. Stimulation of the claustral electrode reproducibly resulted in a complete arrest of volitional behavior, unresponsiveness, and amnesia without negative motor symptoms or mere aphasia. The disruption of consciousness did not outlast the stimulation and occurred without any epileptiform discharges. We found a significant increase in correlation for interactions affecting medial parietal and posterior frontal channels during stimulations that disrupted consciousness compared with those that did not. Our findings suggest that the left claustrum/anterior insula is an important part of a network that subserves consciousness and that disruption of consciousness is related to increased EEG signal synchrony within frontal-parietal networks.",

While much has been made of the risks of new drug therapies, not enough attention has been given to the risks of uncontrolled and progressive epilepsy. This critical review summarizes known risks associated with refractory epilepsy, provides practical clinical recommendations, and indicates areas for future research. Eight international epilepsy experts from Europe, the United States, and South America met on May 4, 2013, to present, review, and discuss relevant concepts, data, and literature on the consequences of refractory epilepsy. While patients with refractory epilepsy represent the minority of the population with epilepsy, they require the overwhelming majority of time, effort, and focus from treating physicians. They also represent the greatest economic and psychosocial burdens. Diagnostic procedures and medical/surgical treatments are not without risks. Overlooked, however, is that these risks are usually smaller than the risks of long-term, uncontrolled seizures. Refractory epilepsy may be progressive, carrying risks of structural damage to the brain and nervous system, comorbidities (osteoporosis, fractures), and increased mortality (from suicide, accidents, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, pneumonia, vascular disease), as well as psychological (depression, anxiety), educational, social (stigma, driving), and vocational consequences. Adding to this burden is neuropsychiatric impairment caused by underlying epileptogenic processes (``essential comorbidities''), which appears to be independent of the effects of ongoing seizures themselves. Tolerating persistent seizures or chronic medicinal adverse effects has risks and consequences that often outweigh risks of seemingly ``more aggressive'' treatments. Future research should focus not only on controlling seizures but also on preventing these consequences.",

This targeted review provides an overview of the social determinants of health framework and applies this perspective to the literature about social and psychosocial factors in epilepsy; a social determinants of health--epilepsy model is proposed. The key social determinants of health in epilepsy include socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, age, and gender. For example, low socioeconomic status and minority status have been associated with a higher risk of epilepsy, more hospitalizations and emergency room visits (versus neurology services), antiepileptic drug nonadherence, and a lower rate of epilepsy surgery. Such differences in care/treatment and outcomes translate into health disparities, many of which are considered unjust (inequitable) and modifiable through social action. Other social determinants of health include structural and sociocultural contextual conditions (e.g., health economy, policy, and social stigma/discrimination) and mediating mechanisms including material (e.g., housing), behavioral/biological (e.g., adherence), psychosocial (e.g., perceived stigma), and health system (e.g., access) factors. There are complex relationships among social determinants of health in epilepsy, which remain poorly understood and hamper efforts to address and eliminate disparities in epilepsy care and outcomes. Further empirical work grounded in sound theory and robust methodologies is needed to identify points of intervention and design effective and socially acceptable solutions to any pervasive disparities in epilepsy.",

In developing DBA/1 mice that had not previously experienced AGSz, administration of a nonselective 5-HT antagonist, cyproheptadine, induced a significantly greater incidence of S-IRA than that of saline. This study confirms that certain drugs that enhance the activation of 5-HT receptors are able to prevent S-IRA, but not all serotonergic drugs are equally effective, which may be relevant to the potential use of these drugs for SUDEP prevention.

Thirteen cerebral regions that are closely related to cardiorespiratory activity were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). The ROI-wise resting-state FC analysis was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with patients at low risk for SUDEP, patients at high risk exhibited significant reductions in the resting-state FC between the pons and the right thalamus, the midbrain and the right thalamus, the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right thalamus, and the left thalamus and the right thalamus. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation is the first to use neuroimaging methods in research on the mechanism of SUDEP and demonstrates the abnormally decreased resting-state FC in the ACC-thalamus-brainstem circuit in patients at high risk for SUDEP. These findings highlight the need to understand the fundamental neural network dysfunction in SUDEP, which may fill the missing link between seizure-related cardiorespiratory dysfunction and SUDEP, and provide a promising neuroimaging biomarker for risk prediction of SUDEP.",

abstract = "Social isolation stress (SIS) in adolescence is accompanied by neurobehavioral disturbances and pathophysiological changes in certain regions of the CNS such as the hippocampus. In this study, we tested whether SIS impacts seizure susceptibility in postnatal male mice due to a role of hippocampal nitric oxide (NO). To do this, we used the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) model of clonic seizures, open-field test, hole-board test, forced swimming test, and plasma corticosterone assay. We aimed to evaluate if 4 weeks of SIS is capable of decreasing seizure threshold along with altering affective and neuroendocrine responses in isolated conditioned (IC) animals in comparison with socially conditioned (SC) animals. In addition, we applied subeffective doses of NO precursor l-arginine (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) and NOS inhibitors 7-NI (15 and 40 mg/kg), aminoguanidine (50 and 100 mg/kg), and l-NAME (10 and 15 mg/kg) to both IC and SC groups prior to the determination of seizure threshold. Injection of a single dose of all mentioned drugs did not induce changes in seizure threshold of SC mice. On the other hand, l-NAME and 7-NI, but not aminoguanidine, modulated the proconvulsant effect of SIS, while l-arginine augmented the latter effect. We also measured the hippocampal nitrite levels after the administration of the aforementioned drugs. Social isolation stress increased the nitrite levels in comparison with those in SC mice, whereas 7-NI and l-NAME, unlike aminoguanidine, mitigated the effect of SIS. Additionally, l-arginine boosted the effects of SIS on nitrite production. In summary, we showed that SIS enhanced seizure susceptibility in the PTZ model of clonic seizures through the activation of the nitrergic system in the hippocampus. Also, we proved that nNOS, but not iNOS, accounts for these changes following SIS.",

DBA/1 mice are a relevant animal model for the study of SUDEP, as these mice exhibit seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) leading to death, which has been observed in patients with witnessed SUDEP. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), reduces S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. Given that DBA/1 mice with S-IRA can be resuscitated using a ventilator, we hypothesized that breathing stimulants can prevent S-IRA and that fluoxetine prevents S-IRA by enhancing ventilation in these mice. Spontaneous respiratory function in anesthetized or awake DBA/1 mice was examined using noninvasive plethysmography before and after administering fluoxetine or breathing stimulants, doxapram, and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine (PK-THPP). The effects of these drugs on S-IRA in DBA/1 mice were tested. As reported previously, systemic administration of fluoxetine reduced S-IRA in awake DBA/1 mice, but fluoxetine in anesthetized and awake DBA/1 mice did not increase basal ventilation or the ventilatory response to 7\% CO2. Both doxapram and PK-THPP increased ventilation in room air and in air+7\% CO2 in anesthetized DBA/1 mice. However, neither of the breathing stimulants reduced the incidence of S-IRA. Our studies confirm that fluoxetine reduces S-IRA in DBA/1 mice without enhancing basal ventilation in the absence of seizures. Although breathing stimulants increased ventilation in the absence of seizures, they were ineffective in reducing S-IRA, indicating that drug-induced increases in ventilation are insufficient to compensate for S-IRA in DBA/1 mice.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of an acute adverse stress as ``trigger'' for the onset of epilepsy. METHODS: Among 4618 consecutive patients, twenty-two reported a major life event within three months before the onset of epilepsy. RESULTS: All patients had focal epilepsy except one with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. The temporal lobe was involved in 90\% of patients with focal epilepsy. More precisely, 13 patients (62\% of patients with focal epilepsy) had medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), two had lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, four had temporoparietooccipital junction epilepsy, and two patients had central lobe epilepsy. The mean age and the median age at onset of epilepsy for patients with MTLE were both 38 years (range: 9.5-65 years). Ten patients had right and three had left MTLE. Among patients with focal epilepsy, MRI was abnormal in 7 (33\%) with hippocampal sclerosis in four, periventricular nodular heterotopia in two, and complex cortical dysgenesis in one. The mean age at onset of epilepsy for patients with brain lesions was 26 years (range: 9.5-49). Twelve patients (54\%) reported a death as a triggering factor for the onset of their epilepsy. Seven patients (32\%) reported that a relationship of trust had been broken. Three patients (14\%) had been subjects of violence. No patient reported sexual abuse as a triggering factor. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that some patients (5/1000 patients) began their seizures in the wake of significant life events. The average age at onset of epilepsy is quite late, around age 30, even in the presence of brain lesions. These patients are emotionally and affectively more prone to have consequences of a stressful life event. The recognition and management of such situations may bring significant relief with improvement of the control of epilepsy.",

author = "Feng, Hua-Jun and Faingold, Carl L",
abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a devastating event, and both DBA/1 and DBA/2 mice have been shown to be relevant animal models for studying SUDEP. DBA mice exhibit seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA), leading to cardiac arrest and subsequent sudden death after generalized audiogenic seizures (AGSs). This sequence of terminal events is also observed in the majority of witnessed human SUDEP cases. Several pathophysiological mechanisms, including respiratory/cardiac dysfunction, have been proposed to contribute to human SUDEP. Several (but not all) selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine, can reversibly block S-IRA, and abnormal expression of 5-HT receptors is found in the brainstem of DBA mice. DBA mice, which do not initially show S-IRA, exhibit S-IRA after treatment with a nonselective 5-HT antagonist. These studies suggest that abnormalities of 5-HT neurotransmission are involved in the pathogenesis of S-IRA in DBA mice. Serotonergic (5-HT) transmission plays an important role in normal respiration, and DBA mice exhibiting S-IRA can be resuscitated using a rodent ventilator. It is important and interesting to know if fluoxetine blocks S-IRA in DBA mice by enhancing respiratory ventilation. To test this, the effects of breathing stimulants, doxapram, and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine (PK-THPP) were compared with the effects of fluoxetine on S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. Although fluoxetine reduces the incidence of S-IRA in DBA/1 mice, as reported previously, the same dose of fluoxetine fails to enhance baseline respiratory ventilation in the absence of AGSs. Doxapram and PK-THPP augment the baseline ventilation in DBA/1 mice. However, these breathing stimulants are ineffective in preventing S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. These data suggest that fluoxetine blocks S-IRA in DBA/1 mice by cellular/molecular mechanisms other than enhancement of basal ventilation. Future research directions are also discussed.

abstract = "AbstractIntroduction Patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) have executive dysfunction and impulsive traits. There are lines of evidence that JME is a heterogeneous epilepsy syndrome considering outcome. In this study, we aimed to analyze this heterogeneity beyond seizure control. The objective was to identify whether the pattern of cognitive dysfunction and impulse control is also heterogeneous, in an attempt to establish possible differences in patients with easy- and hard-to-control epilepsies. Methods Essentially, 57 patients with JME were compared with 44 controls. Patients and controls were assessed with a neuropsychological battery for executive, attention, and memory functions. The expression of impulsive traits was evaluated with the Temperament and Character Inventory --- novelty seeking domain. Then, patients were categorized according to seizure control as having easy- and hard-to-control JME. Results Patients with hard-to-control JME showed worse performance in 12 out of 25 neuropsychological tests than those with easy-to-control JME. Patients with hard-to-control JME also demonstrated significantly higher scores in novelty seeking --- subfactor impulsiveness (p = 0.002). Significance Our study demonstrated the existence of distinct or more severe cognitive and psychiatric profiles in a subset of patients with JME. Patients with treatment-refractory seizures seem to present a broader impairment related to both cognitive deficits and impulsive traits. These findings suggest that patients with JME are not equally compromised by executive and memory deficits or dysfunction, neither by their impulsive traits. Thus, there is a need for a better characterization of patients with JME to include diverse phenotypes since our results suggest a possible existence of distinct groups of patients with JME.",

abstract = "AbstractObjectiveEpileptic seizures (ES) are often seen as a medical emergency, and their immediate and accurate recognition are pivotal in providing acute care. However, a number of clinical situations may mimic ES, potentially leading to misdiagnosis at the emergency room and to inappropriate prescription of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the acute and chronic settings. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) play a major role in this scenario and often delay the correct diagnosis and increase treatment morbidity and cost. First responders often conduct the initial assessment of these patients, and their impression may be decisive in the prehospital approach to seizures. We sought to investigate and improve the accuracy of PNES diagnosis among professionals involved in the initial assistance to patients with seizures.MethodsFifty-three registered nurses, 34 emergency physicians, 33 senior year medical students, and 12 neurology residents took a short training program consisting of an initial video-based seizure assessment test (pretest), immediately followed by a 30-minute presentation of a 6-item bedside diagnostic tool and then a video-based reassessment (posttest). Baseline status and learning curves were determined.ResultsThe distinct professional categories showed no significant differences in their ability to diagnose PNES on both pretests and posttests. All groups improved diagnostic skills after the instructional program.SignificanceThe findings helped determine the best identifiable PNES clinical signs and to provide initial validation to a novel diagnostic instrument.

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are episodic alterations in behavior presumed to reflect a physical manifestation of underlying psychological distress. Standardized treatment approaches for PNES care are lacking. We evaluated common approaches to PNES management that do not require significant commitment of time and resources. METHODOLOGY: Patients with PNES established with video-EEG monitoring were randomized to one of the following three groups: 1) PNES diagnosis delivered per the discretion of the attending physician with advice to seek mental health assistance in the community (n=12), 2) scripted PNES diagnosis provided and inpatient psychiatry consult obtained (n=10), and 3) weekly follow-up phone calls made in addition to scripted diagnosis and inpatient psychiatry consultation (n=15). Reduction in event frequency measured at 8weeks following hospital discharge represented the primary outcome variable. Secondary variables analyzed included exploration of change in self-reported mood, quality of life, and healthcare utilization. RESULTS: No significant improvements were noted in patients simply given a PNES diagnosis and advised to seek outside care on any measure. In contrast, patients receiving a scripted diagnosis and psychiatric consultation demonstrated decreased PNES frequency accompanied by improved quality of life (QOL). Patients also receiving weekly phone calls not only demonstrated decreased PNES frequency and improvements in QOL but also exhibited improved mood. DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that providing diagnostic information regarding PNES is insufficient by itself to meaningfully affect patient outcome. Structured feedback and psychiatric consultation appeared adequate to significantly reduce PNES frequency and improve aspects of quality of life, while the addition of a weekly phone contact also led to improved mood.",

abstract = "Abstract The intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is increasingly being used for studies on epileptogenesis and antiepileptogenesis. Almost all previous studies used male mice for this purpose, and no study is available in this or other models of acquired epilepsy that directly compared epileptogenesis in female and male rodents. Epidemiological studies suggest that gender may affect susceptibility to epilepsy and its prognosis; therefore, one goal of this study was to investigate whether sex has an influence on latent period and epileptogenesis in the intrahippocampal kainate model in mice. Another aspect that was examined in the present study was whether mouse strain differences in epileptogenesis exist. Finally, we examined the effects of different types of anesthesia (chloral hydrate, isoflurane) on kainate-induced status epilepticus (SE) and epileptogenesis. Continuous (24/7) video-EEG monitoring was used during SE and the 2 weeks following SE as well as 4--6 weeks after SE. In male NMRI mice with chloral hydrate anesthesia during kainate injection, SE was followed by a seizure-free latent period of 10--14 days if hippocampal paroxysmal discharges (HPDs) recorded from the kainate focus were considered the onset of epilepsy. Anesthesia with isoflurane led to a more rapid onset and higher severity of SE, and not all male NMRI mice exhibited a seizure-free latent period. Female NMRI mice differed from male animals in the lack of any clear latent period, independently of anesthesia type. Furthermore, HPDs were only rarely observed. These problems were not resolved by decreasing the dose of kainate or using other strains (C57BL/6, FVB/N) of female mice. The present data are the first to demonstrate marked sex-related differences in the latent period following brain injury in a rodent model of acquired epilepsy. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the choice of anesthestic agent during kainate administration affects SE severity and as a consequence, the latent period, which may explain some of the differences reported for this model in the literature.",

The majority of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is the most common type of epilepsy, have to live not only with seizures but also with behavioral alterations, including anxiety, psychosis, depression, and impaired cognitive functioning. The pilocarpine model has been recognized as an animal model of TLE. However, there are few studies addressing behavioral alterations in the maturation phase when evaluating the time course of the epileptogenic process after pilocarpine administration. Therefore, the present work was designed to analyze the neurobehavioral impairments of male adult Wistar rats during maturation and chronic phases in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Behavioral tests included: open-field tasks, olfactory discrimination, social recognition, elevated plus maze, and the forced swimming test. The main behavioral alterations observed in both maturation and chronic phases of the pilocarpine model were olfactory and short-term social memory deficits and decrease in the immobility time in the forced swimming test. Moreover, increased anxiety-like responses were only observed in the maturation phase. These findings indicate that early behavioral impairments can be observed in the pilocarpine model during the maturation phase, and these behavioral deficits also occur during the acquired epilepsy (chronic phase). Several of the neurobehavioral impairments that are associated with epilepsy in humans were observed in the pilocarpine-treated rats, thus, rendering this animal model a useful tool to study neuroprotective strategies as well as neurobiological and psychopathological mechanisms associated with epileptogenesis.",

The genetics of one of these mutants is described in detail, and the effect of diet on the same mutant is also described in detail. Research on genetic and environmental effects on the cortical EEG of audiogenic seizures is reviewed; this research included two of these mutants. The cortical EEG associated with audiogenic seizures in this study was consistent with audiogenic seizures being a type of brain stem epilepsy as had been proposed by others. Also, I proposed that brain stem pathophysiology is the same regardless of the genetic or environmental pathway to audiogenic seizure susceptibility. Research is also reviewed using these mutants to determine whether or not a strain association between glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity in whole brain and susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is pleiotropic and whether or not a strain association between nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activity in the granule cell layer of the dentate fascia of the hippocampus and susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is a lineal or collateral pleiotropy. Lastly, pleiotropy as an explanation for strain comorbidities in aggressive behavior and audiogenic seizures is considered.

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) are closely linked with psychological distress, but their etiology is not well-understood. We reviewed psychiatric comorbidity in PNESs and epileptic seizures (ESs) with an aim to assist understanding, diagnosis, and management of PNESs. METHODS: A search of Web of Science, MEDLINE (PubMed), PsycINFO, and Scopus identified 32 relevant studies on the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in PNESs. We used meta-analysis to compare psychiatric comorbidity between PNESs and ESs. RESULTS: Samples with PNESs had high rates of psychiatric comorbidity overall (53-100\%), notably including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and personality and anxiety disorders. Compared with ESs, samples with PNESs had more psychiatric comorbidity overall (RR: 1.30, 95\% CI: 1.14-1.48, p<0.0001) with significantly elevated risks found for PTSD, personality disorder, and anxiety but not depression. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric disorders are more common in PNESs than ESs. Because of methodological limitations of available studies, causality cannot be established; prospective longitudinal designs are required.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To ascertain the cause of mortality and incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients with supernumerary isodicentric chromosome 15 (idic15). METHODS: Cases were obtained from those reported to the Dup15q Alliance (www.dup15q.org) between April 2006 and June 2012; ~709 families were registered in their database. We performed a case-control study comparing reported SUDEP cases to living patients with epilepsy from the Dup15q Alliance registry who volunteered to be interviewed to examine clinical risk factors. KEY FINDINGS: There were nineteen deaths with idic15; 17 had epilepsy, and nine deaths were due to probable or definite SUDEP (4 females, median age of death was 13.5years, range: 3-26years). Possible SUDEP occurred in 2 others. The remainder died from status epilepticus (3), pneumonia (3), aspiration (1), and drowning (1). Nonambulatory status and lack of seizure control were more common among SUDEP cases than living dup15q patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that SUDEP is a common cause of death among children and young adults with isodicentric chromosome 15q11.2q13 duplications and patients with the most severe neurologic dysfunction may be at highest risk. Further studies are needed to examine if this specific genetic defect plays a role in the mechanism of SUDEP in these patients.",

abstract = "Precipitation and inhibition of seizures and epileptic discharges by sensory stimuli are receiving increasing attention because they provide insight into natural seizure generation in human epilepsies and can identify potential nonpharmacological therapies. We aimed to investigate modulation (provocation or inhibition) of epileptiform discharges (EDs) in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) versus idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) by olfactory stimulation (OS) compared with standard provocation methods. The underlying hypothesis was that any response would be more likely to occur in MTLE, considering the anatomical connections of the temporal lobe to the olfactory system. This multicenter, international study recruited patients with either MTLE or IGE who were systematically compared for responses to OS using an EEG/video-EEG protocol including a 30-min baseline, twice 3-min olfactory stimulation with ylang-ylang, hyperventilation, and intermittent photic stimulation. The 95\% confidence interval (CI) for the baseline EDs in each patient was calculated, and modulation was assumed when the number of EDs during any 3-min test period was outside this CI. A total of 134 subjects (55 with MTLE, 53 with IGE, and 26 healthy controls) were included. Epileptiform discharges were inhibited during OS in about half the patients with both MTLE and IGE, whereas following OS, provocation was seen in 29.1\% of patients with MTLE and inhibition in 28.3\% of patients with IGE. Olfactory stimulation was less provocative than standard activation methods. The frequent subclinical modulation of epileptic activity in both MTLE and IGE is in striking contrast with the rarity of reports of olfactory seizure precipitation and arrest. Inhibition during OS can be explained by nonspecific arousal. The delayed responses seem to be related to processing of olfactory stimuli in the temporal lobe, thalamus, and frontal cortex.",

author = "Bartlam, Roisin and Mohanraj, Rajiv",
abstract = "BACKGROUND: Seizures can lead to cardiac arrhythmias by a number of mechanisms including activation/inhibition of cortical autonomic centers, increase in vagal tone through activation of brainstem reflex centers, and respiratory failure. Ictal asystole (IA) is a potential mechanism underlying sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We analyzed the clinical features of 5 patients who developed IA requiring pacemaker implantation. METHODS: Patients with ictal arrhythmias were identified from the video-telemetry and ambulatory EEG database at Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, as well as an independent epilepsy residential care facility. Only those who had IA requiring pacemaker implantation were included in the analysis. A total of 5 patients were identified. RESULTS: Of the 5 patients with IA, 4 were female. All 5 patients had focal epilepsy, and four had temporal lobe epilepsy. Ictal asystole occurred with focal seizures with impairment of awareness. Seizure onset was left-sided in 2 patients, right-sided in one, left-sided onset with switch of lateralization in one, and nonlateralized in one patient. Three patients had hippocampal sclerosis, one of whom had undergone epilepsy surgery, one had traumatic encephalomalacia of the temporal lobe, and one patient had no lesions detected on MRI. Interictal epileptiform activity was more pronounced during sleep in all patients. Asystole occurred in association with sleep-related seizures in 4 of 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ictal asystole (IA) occurred in association with sleep-related seizures in 4 out of 5 cases, predominantly in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. These findings may be of relevance to SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) frequently occurs after generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) and may be involved in the pathophysiology of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). It is usually determined using conventional scalp EEG which is likely to miss cerebral activity in deeper brain structures. Here, we examined intracranial EEG activity after GCS to unravel the pattern and extent of local brain activity during apparent PGES on scalp EEG (s-PGES). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed electroencephalographic data of people with chronic epilepsy who had GCS during presurgical video-EEG monitoring using simultaneous intracranial and scalp EEG (10-20 system) electrodes. RESULTS: Twenty-five GCS (20 with s-PGES) of 15 patients with an average number of 88$\pm$42 intracranial electrode contacts were included. The majority of GCS with s-PGES (18 of 20) displayed persisting or reemerging intracranial EEG activity during apparent PGES on scalp EEG. Three patterns were identified: Pattern 1 (11 GCS, 6 patients) consisted of continuous local interictal activity; Pattern 2 (5 GCS, 5 patients) displayed suppressed EEG activity at all intracranial contacts in the early phase of s-PGES, but reemerging local brain activity before s-PGES dissolved; and Pattern 3 (2 GCS, 2 patients) showed persistent local ictal activity during s-PGES. Persisting intracranial EEG activity at PGES onset on scalp EEG was present in 10$\pm$14\% (range: 0 to 42\%) of all intracranial contacts and mostly in the temporal lobe. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that, during apparently generalized postictal EEG suppression, local brain activity persists or reemerges in most GCS. Possible implications of this localized neuronal activity in the context of SUDEP are discussed in the paper.",

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Premature mortality is a major issue in Dravet syndrome (DS). To improve understanding of DS premature mortality, we conducted a comprehensive literature search with a particular emphasis on SUDEP. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Academic Search Premier, and ScienceDirect on the following terms: ``Dravet syndrome'', ``severe myoclonic epilepsy'', ``SMEI'', ``mortality'', ``survivors'', ``prognosis'', and ``death''. DS cases or cohorts studies reporting mortality were included. RESULTS: The search yielded 676 articles and 86 meeting abstracts. After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, full text of 73 articles was reviewed. Only 28 articles and six meeting abstracts met inclusion criteria. Five articles and four meeting abstracts were excluded, as the case(s) were also described elsewhere. After checking the references, five additional studies were included. The 30 items reported 177 unique cases. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy was the likely cause in nearly half of the cases (n=87, 49\%), followed by status epilepticus (n=56, 32\%). Drowning or accidental death was reported in 14 cases (8\%), infections in 9 (5\%), other causes in six (3\%), and unknown in five (3\%). Age at death was reported for 142 of the 177 cases (80\%), with a mean age of 8.7$\pm$9.8years (SD); 73\% died before the age of 10years. DISCUSSION: Dravet syndrome is characterized by high epilepsy-related premature mortality and a marked young age at death. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is the leading reported cause of death in DS, accounting for nearly half of all deaths. The cause of this excess mortality remains elusive but may be explained by epilepsy severity, as well as genetic susceptibility to SUDEP.",

abstract = "Patients with epilepsy are at risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The most common series of events in witnessed cases of SUDEP is a generalized convulsive seizure followed by terminal apnea. Risk factors for SUDEP include prolonged postictal depression (PID), as well as alcohol abuse. The present study examined these issues in a genetic epilepsy model that exhibits generalized convulsive audiogenic seizures (AGSz) but rarely exhibits seizure-induced death, the genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPR-9s). We evaluated the effect of ethanol withdrawal (ETX) in GEPR-9s on respiration patterns, duration of PID, and the incidence of seizure-induced death. Audiogenic seizures were induced in GEPR-9s and in normal Sprague-Dawley rats, which were subjected to a 4-day binge ethanol protocol, 18-24h after the last ethanol dose. Following the tonic seizures, all GEPR-9s exhibited PID, characterized by loss of the righting reflex and respiratory distress (RD), which were absent during ETX seizures in the normal rats. During ETX, GEPR-9s exhibited significant increases in the duration of PID and RD, compared with vehicle-treated GEPR-9s. A significant increase in the incidence of death following seizure in GEPR-9s subjected to ETX was observed, compared with that in vehicle-treated GEPR-9s and normal rats subjected to ETX. Death in GEPR-9s was preceded by prolonged seizures because, in part, of the emergence of post-tonic generalized clonus. These results indicate that ETX induced significant increases in the duration of PID and RD, which contributed to the greater incidence of mortality in GEPR-9s compared with that in vehicle-treated GEPR-9s and normal rats. These experiments observed an elevated risk of sudden death associated with alcohol withdrawal in a genetic epilepsy model that had previously been identified as a risk factor in human SUDEP.",

abstract = "Drugs that enhance the action of serotonin (5-hydroxytrypamine, 5-HT), including several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), reduce susceptibility to seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) that leads to death in the DBA/1 mouse model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). However, it is not clear if specific 5-HT receptors are important in the action of these drugs and whether the brain is the major site of action of these agents in this SUDEP model. The current study examined the actions of agents that affect the 5-HT3 receptor subtype on S-IRA and whether intracerebroventricular (ICV) microinjection of an SSRI would reduce S-IRA susceptibility in DBA/1 mice. The data indicate that systemic administration of SR 57227, a 5-HT3 agonist, was effective in blocking S-IRA in doses that did not block seizures, and the S-IRA blocking effect of the SSRI, fluoxetine, was abolished by coadministration of a 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron. Intracerebroventricular administration of fluoxetine in the present study was also able to block S-IRA without blocking seizures. These findings suggest that 5-HT3 receptors play an important role in the block of S-IRA by serotonergic agents, such as SSRIs, which is consistent with the abnormal expression of 5-HT3 receptors in the brainstem of DBA mice observed previously. Taken together, these data indicate that systemically administered serotonergic agents act, at least, in part, in the brain, to reduce S-IRA susceptibility in DBA/1 mice and that 5-HT3 receptors may be important to this effect.",

title = "Can natural ways to stimulate the vagus nerve improve seizure control?",
author = "Yuen, Alan W C and Sander, Josemir W",
abstract = "The vagus nerve (VN) is the longest cranial nerve, innervating the neck, thorax and abdomen, with afferent fibers transmitting a range of interoceptive stimuli and efferent fibres to somatic structures and autonomic preganglions. Over the last few decades, electrical stimulation of the VN using implanted devices (VNS) has been developed leading to its approval for the treatment of epilepsy and depression. More recently, non-invasive devices to stimulation the VN have been developed. The VN has many functions and the activity that is most amenable to assessment is its effect in controlling the cardiac rhythm. This can be easily assessed by measuring heart rate variability (HRV). Decreased HRV is a result of poorer vagal parasympathetic tone and is associated with a wide range of ill health conditions including a higher risk of early mortality. People with epilepsy, particularly those with poorly controlled seizures, have been shown to have impaired parasympathetic tone. So, might natural ways to stimulate the VN, shown to improve parasympathetic tone as indicated by increased HRV, improve seizure control? There are numerous natural ways that have been shown to stimulate the VN, improving HRV and hence parasympathetic tone. These natural ways fall mainly into 3 categories - stress reduction, exercise, and nutrition. Though the natural ways to stimulate the VN have been shown to increase HRV, they have not been shown to reduce seizures. The exception is listening to Mozart's music, which has been shown to increase parasympathetic tone and decrease seizures. Clearly much more work is required to examine the effect of the various ways to increase HRV on seizure occurrence.",

author = "Rosenberg, Evan C and Patra, Pabitra H and Whalley, Benjamin J",
abstract = "The isolation and identification of the discrete plant cannabinoids in marijuana revived interest in analyzing historical therapeutic claims made for cannabis in clinical case studies and anecdotes. In particular, sources as old as the 11th and 15th centuries claimed efficacy for crude marijuana extracts in the treatment of convulsive disorders, prompting a particularly active area of preclinical research into the therapeutic potential of plant cannabinoids in epilepsy. Since that time, a large body of literature has accumulated describing the effects of several of the >100 individual plant cannabinoids in preclinical models of seizures, epilepsy, epileptogenesis, and epilepsy-related neuroprotection. We surveyed the literature for relevant reports of such plant cannabinoid effects and critically reviewed their findings. We found that acute CB1R agonism in simple models of acute seizures in rodents typically produces anti-convulsant effects whereas CB1R antagonists exert converse effects in the same models. However, when the effects of such ligands are examined in more complex models of epilepsy, epileptogenesis and neuroprotection, a less simplistic narrative emerges. Here, the complex interactions between (i) brain regions involved in a given model, (ii) relative contributions of endocannabinoid signaling to modulation of synaptic transmission in such areas, (iii) multi-target effects, (iv) cannabinoid type 1 and type 2 receptor signaling interactions and, (v) timing, (vi) duration and (vii) localization of ligand administration suggest that there is both anti-epileptic therapeutic potential and a pro-epileptic risk in up- and down-regulation of endocannabinoid signaling in the central nervous system. Factors such receptor desensitization and specific pharmacology of ligands used (e.g. full vs partial agonists and neutral antagonists vs inverse agonists) also appear to play an important role in the effects reported. Furthermore, the effects of several plant cannabinoids, most notably cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidavarin (CBDV), in models of seizures, epilepsy, epileptogenesis, and neuroprotection are less ambiguous, and consistent with reports of therapeutically beneficial effects of these compounds in clinical studies. However, continued paucity of firm information regarding the therapeutic molecular mechanism of CBD/CBDV highlights the continued need for research in this area in order to identify as yet under-exploited targets for drug development and raise our understanding of treatment-resistant epilepsies. The recent reporting of positive results for cannabidiol treatment in two Phase III clinical trials in treatment-resistant epilepsies provides pivotal evidence of clinical efficacy for one plant cannabinoid in epilepsy. Moreover, risks and/or benefits associated with the use of unlicensed $\Delta$(9)-THC containing marijuana extracts in pediatric epilepsies remain poorly understood. Therefore, in light of these paradigm-changing clinical events, the present review's findings aim to drive future drug development for newly-identified targets and indications, identify important limitations of animal models in the investigation of plant cannabinoid effects in the epilepsies, and focuses future research in this area on specific, unanswered questions regarding the complexities of endocannabinoid signaling in epilepsy.

abstract = "Background and objectives Although there has recently been significant debate regarding the importance of disclosing the risk of SUDEP, professional societies and clinical practice guidelines currently recommend that the risk of SUDEP be disclosed as part of a comprehensive epilepsy education program. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to examine whether healthcare providers treating pediatric patients with epilepsy in Italy would disclose the risk of SUDEP to the parents of children with epilepsy. Methods The present study assessed data from a questionnaire that collected sociodemographic information and clinicians' attitudes towards SUDEP. The survey was available online from September to December 2015. Chi-squared ($\chi$2) tests and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed when appropriate, and a qualitative content analysis of open-ended questions was performed. Findings A total of 114 medical doctors (71 females and 43 males) completed the questionnaire. Of the respondents, 18 (16.2\%) stated that all patients should be counseled about SUDEP, 22 (19.8\%) thought that the majority should be, 58 (52.3\%) said that only a minority should be, and 13 (11.7\%) believed none should be. With respect to physicians' experience in counseling about SUDEP, only 2 (1.8\%) counseled all their patients. A univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the factors associated with ``not counseling about SUDEP at all'' were the low number of patients with epilepsy they took care of (p<0.01), fewer years of experience (p=0.03), and the belief that it was safe from a legal point of view (p<0.001), The main reasons for counseling about SUDEP were refractory course of epilepsy (79\%) and if the parent/patient requested information (65\%). Additionally, the findings of the qualitative analysis highlighted the emotional difficulties that neuropediatricians encounter when dealing with the disclosure of SUDEP. Conclusions The present findings showed that a minority of neuropediatricians in Italy counseled all parents of their patients about SUDEP.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Hippocampal monitoring is often used in the intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) seizure model for detection and quantification of early ictal activity. Here, we investigated extra-hippocampal seizure onset zones (SOZs) in this model. METHODS: Eight male Sprague Dawley rats implanted with depth electrodes were continuously recorded during intraperitoneal KA injections until status epilepticus (SE) was induced. Another group of four rats was monitored chronically up to two weeks after emergence of spontaneous recurrent seizures. All rats had hippocampal electrodes. Other sampled brain regions included, among others, the claustrum, piriform cortex, and orbital cortex. Seizures recorded with video-EEG were visually analyzed. RESULTS: In the 58 seizures recorded during KA injections, the SOZ was extrahippocampal in 7 (12\%), diffuse in 29 (50\%), and hippocampal in 22 (38\%). Of the 14 spontaneous seizures recorded, none were solely extrahippocampal, 10 (71\%) were diffuse, and 4 (29\%) were of hippocampal onset. All extra-hippocampal seizures propagated to the hippocampus within 4 to 50s (mean=14, n=7). No distinctive semiological manifestations correlated with the SOZs. SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that seizures can have multifocal SOZs in the KA model. This finding is important to consider when using this model, among other purposes, to screen for new therapies, study pharmacoresistance, or investigate comorbidities of epilepsy.",

abstract = "Cognitive and perceptual comorbidities frequently accompany epilepsy and psychogenic nonepileptic events (PNEE). However, and despite the fact that perceptual function is built upon a multisensory foundation, little knowledge exists concerning multisensory function in these populations. Here, we characterized facets of multisensory processing abilities in patients with epilepsy and PNEE, and probed the relationship between individual resting-state EEG complexity and these psychophysical measures in each patient. We prospectively studied a cohort of patients with epilepsy (N=18) and PNEE (N=20) patients who were admitted to Vanderbilt's Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) and weaned off of anticonvulsant drugs. Unaffected age-matched persons staying with the patients in the EMU (N=15) were also recruited as controls. All participants performed two tests of multisensory function: an audio-visual simultaneity judgment and an audio-visual redundant target task. Further, in the cohort of patients with epilepsy and PNEE we quantified resting state EEG gamma power and complexity. Compared with both patients with epilepsy and control subjects, patients with PNEE exhibited significantly poorer acuity in audiovisual temporal function as evidenced in significantly larger temporal binding windows (i.e., they perceived larger stimulus asynchronies as being presented simultaneously). These differences appeared to be specific for temporal function, as there was no difference among the three groups in a non-temporally based measure of multisensory function - the redundant target task. Further, patients with PNEE exhibited more complex resting state EEG patterns as compared to their patients with epilepsy, and EEG complexity correlated with multisensory temporal performance on a subject-by-subject manner. Taken together, findings seem to indicate that patients with PNEE bind information from audition and vision over larger temporal intervals when compared with control subjects as well as patients with epilepsy. This difference in multisensory function appears to be specific to the temporal domain, and may be a contributing factor to the behavioral and perceptual alterations seen in this population.",

abstract = "In the context of modeling epilepsy and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, we review the Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR), first introduced to the neuroscience international community more than 25years ago. The WAR strain is a genetically selected reflex model susceptible to audiogenic seizures (AS), acutely mimicking brainstem-dependent tonic-clonic seizures and chronically (by audiogenic kindling), temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Seminal neuroethological, electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular protocols support the WAR strain as a suitable and reliable animal model to study the complexity and emergent functions typical of epileptogenic networks. Furthermore, since epilepsy comorbidities have emerged as a hot topic in epilepsy research, we discuss the use of WARs in fields such as neuropsychiatry, memory and learning, neuroplasticity, neuroendocrinology, and cardio-respiratory autonomic regulation. Last, but not least, we propose that this strain be used in ``omics'' studies, as well as with the most advanced molecular and computational modeling techniques. Collectively, pioneering and recent findings reinforce the complexity associated with WAR alterations, consequent to the combination of their genetically-dependent background and seizure profile. To add to previous studies, we are currently developing more powerful behavioral, EEG, and molecular methods, combined with computational neuroscience/network modeling tools, to further increase the WAR strain's contributions to contemporary neuroscience in addition to increasing knowledge in a wide array of neuropsychiatric and other comorbidities, given shared neural networks. During the many years that the WAR strain has been studied, a constantly expanding network of multidisciplinary collaborators has generated a growing research and knowledge network. Our current and major wish is to make the WARs available internationally to share our knowledge and to facilitate the planning and execution of multi-institutional projects, eagerly needed to contribute to paradigm shifts in epileptology.

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a devastating epilepsy complication, and no effective preventive strategies are currently available for this fatal disorder. Clinical and animal studies of SUDEP demonstrate that seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) is the primary event leading to death after generalized seizures in many cases. Enhancing brain levels of serotonin reduces S-IRA in animal models relevant to SUDEP, including the DBA/1 mouse. Given that serotonin in the brain plays an important role in modulating respiration and arousal, these findings suggest that deficits in respiration and/or arousal may contribute to S-IRA. It is well known that norepinephrine is an important neurotransmitter that modulates respiration and arousal in the brain as well. Therefore, we hypothesized that enhancing noradrenergic neurotransmission suppresses S-IRA. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), on S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or pentylenetetrazole in DBA/1 mice. We report the original observation that atomoxetine specifically suppresses S-IRA without altering the susceptibility to seizures evoked by acoustic stimulation, and atomoxetine also reduces S-IRA evoked by pentylenetetrazole in DBA/1 mice. Our data suggest that the noradrenergic signaling is importantly involved in S-IRA, and that atomoxetine, a medication widely used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is potentially useful to prevent SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To review studies on structural pulmonary and cardiac changes in SUDEP cases as well as studies showing pulmonary or cardiac structural changes in living epilepsy patients. METHODS: We conducted electronic literature searches using the PubMed database for articles published in English, regardless of publication year, that included data on cardiac and/or pulmonary structural abnormalities in SUDEP cases or in living epilepsy patients during the postictal period. RESULTS: Fourteen postmortem studies reported pulmonary findings in SUDEP cases. Two focused mainly on assessing lung weights in SUDEP cases versus controls; no group difference was found. The other 12 reported descriptive autopsy findings. Among all SUDEP cases with available descriptive postmortem pulmonary examination, 72\% had pulmonary changes, most often pulmonary edema/congestion, and, less frequently, intraalveolar hemorrhage. Eleven studies reported on cardiac pathology in SUDEP. Cardiac abnormalities were found in approximately one-fourth of cases. The most common findings were myocyte hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis of various degrees. Among living epilepsy patients, postictal pulmonary pathology was the most commonly reported pulmonary abnormality and the most common postictal cardiac abnormality was transient left ventricular dysfunction - Takotsubo or neurogenic stunned myocardium. SIGNIFICANCE: Cardiac and pulmonary pathological abnormalities are frequent among SUDEP cases, most commonly pulmonary edema/congestion and focal interstitial myocardial fibrosis. Most findings are not quantified, with subjective elements and undefined interobserver reliability, and lack of controls such as matched epilepsy patients who died from other causes. Further, studies have not systematically evaluated potential confounding factors, including postmortem interval to autopsy, paramedic resuscitation and IV fluids administration, underlying heart/lung disease, and risk factors for cardiac or pulmonary disease. Prospective studies with controls are needed to define the heart and lung changes in SUDEP and understand their potential relationship to mechanisms of death in SUDEP.",

abstract = "It is becoming increasingly clear that the genetic background of mice and rats, even in inbred strains, can have a profound influence on measures of seizure susceptibility and epilepsy. These differences can be capitalized upon through genetic mapping studies to reveal genes important for seizures and epilepsy. However, strain background and particularly mixed genetic backgrounds of transgenic animals need careful consideration in both the selection of strains and in the interpretation of results and conclusions. For instance, mice with targeted deletions of genes involved in epilepsy can have profoundly disparate phenotypes depending on the background strain. In this review, we discuss findings related to how this genetic heterogeneity has and can be utilized in the epilepsy field to reveal novel insights into seizures and epilepsy. Moreover, we discuss how caution is needed in regards to rodent strain or even animal vendor choice, and how this can significantly influence seizure and epilepsy parameters in unexpected ways. This is particularly critical in decisions regarding the strain of choice used in generating mice with targeted deletions of genes. Finally, we discuss the role of environment (at vendor and/or laboratory) and epigenetic factors for inter- and intrastrain differences and how such differences can affect the expression of seizures and the animals' performance in behavioral tests that often accompany acute and chronic seizure testing.",

abstract = "The Dravet Syndrome Foundation (DSF) conducted the largest in-depth survey of parents and caregivers of patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) to date, in order to (1) identify top concerns among caregivers, (2) establish an approximate frequency of characteristics and comorbidities of DS beyond seizures, and (3) provide direction for clinicians and researchers looking to study the effects of DS on the patient and family unit. Two hundred fifty-six responses were received representing a patient age range of 9months to 32years with a median age group of 7-10years (IQR=8). In an open response, caregivers ranked speech/communication, impacts on siblings, and cognitive impairment as their top concerns after seizure control, and nearly two-thirds of caregivers reported having suffered from depression. Some characteristics of DS such as gait issues increased with patient age, while others, including photosensitivity, hypotonia, and ataxia, were present from a young age. Comorbidities such as sleep disturbances and cardiac abnormalities were more frequently reported than in previous studies and some (including bradycardia) were correlated with SCN1A mutation status. This survey supports the concept of Dravet syndrome as a disease of the central nervous system with far-reaching effects and highlights the importance of the patient voice in determining appropriate research objectives. While seizure frequency is a relatively well-understood objective, seizures represent only a portion of parent and caregiver concerns. Studying the characteristics of DS described herein may identify additional outcomes significant for research.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the association of sleep with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis based on literature search from databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using keywords ``SUDEP'', or ``sudden unexpected death in epilepsy'', or ``sudden unexplained death in epilepsy''. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy was considered to occur during sleep if the patient was found in bed, if the SUDEP cases were documented as in sleep, or if the patient was found at bedside on the bedroom floor. RESULTS: Circadian pattern was documented in 880 of the 1025 SUDEP cases in 67 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the 880 SUDEP cases, 69.3\% occurred during sleep and 30.7\% occurred during wakefulness. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy was significantly associated with sleep as compared to wakefulness (P<0.001). In the subgroup of 272 cases in which circadian pattern and age were documented, patients 40years old or younger were more likely to die in sleep than those older than 40years (OR: 2.0; 95\% CI=1.0, 3.8; P=0.05). In the subgroup of 114 cases in which both circadian pattern and body position at the time of death were documented, 87.6\% (95\% CI=81.1\%, 94.2\%) of patients who died during sleep were in the prone position, whereas 52.9\% (95\% CI=24.7\%, 81.1\%) of patients who died during wakefulness were in the prone position. Patients with nocturnal seizures were 6.3 times more likely to die in a prone position than those with diurnal seizures (OR: 6.3; 95\% CI=2.0, 19.5; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association of SUDEP with sleep, suggesting that sleep is a significant risk factor for SUDEP. Although the risks of SUDEP associated with sleep are unknown and likely multifactorial, the prone position might be an important contributory factor.",

The existence of common pathogenic mechanisms has been postulated as a potential explanation of this phenomenon.

author = "Hooper, Andrew and Paracha, Rumzah and Maguire, Jamie",
abstract = "Our laboratory recently demonstrated that seizures activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increasing circulating levels of corticosterone (O'Toole et al., 2013). Given the well-established proconvulsant actions of corticosterone, we hypothesized that seizure-induced activation of the HPA axis may contribute to future seizure susceptibility. Further, since hypercortisolism is associated with depression, we propose that seizure-induced activation of the HPA axis may contribute to comorbid depression and epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice lacking the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) $\delta$ subunit specifically in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons (Gabrd/Crh mice), which exhibit hyporeactivity of the HPA axis (Lee et al., 2014). Gabrd/Crh mice exhibit blunted seizure-induced elevations in corticosterone, establishing a useful tool to investigate the contribution of HPA axis dysfunction on epilepsy and associated comorbidities. Interestingly, Gabrd/Crh mice exhibit decreased acute seizure susceptibility following kainic acid (KA) administration. Furthermore, chronically epileptic Gabrd/Crh mice exhibit a decrease in both spontaneous seizure frequency and depression-like behaviors compared with chronically epileptic Cre-/- littermates. Seizure susceptibility and associated depression-like behaviors can be restored to wild type levels by treating Gabrd/Crh mice with exogenous corticosterone. Similarly, chemogenetic activation of CRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is sufficient to increase seizure susceptibility; whereas, chemogenetic inhibition of CRH neurons in the PVN of the hypothalamus is sufficient to decrease seizure susceptibility and depression-like behaviors in chronically epileptic mice. These data suggest that seizure-induced activation of the HPA axis promotes seizure susceptibility and comorbid depression-like behaviors, suggesting that the HPA axis may be a novel target for seizure control.",

abstract = "There are reports of patients whose epileptic seizures are prevented by means of olfactory stimulation. Similar findings were described in animal models of epilepsy, such as the electrical kindling of amygdala, where olfactory stimulation with toluene (TOL) suppressed seizures in most rats, even when the stimuli were 20\% above the threshold to evoke seizures in already kindled animals. The Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain is a model of tonic-clonic seizures induced by acute acoustic stimulation, although it also expresses limbic seizures when repeated acoustic stimulation occurs - a process known as audiogenic kindling (AK). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether or not the olfactory stimulation with TOL would interfere on the behavioral expression of brainstem (acute) and limbic (chronic) seizures in the WAR strain. For this, animals were exposed to TOL or saline (SAL) and subsequently exposed to acoustic stimulation in two conditions that generated: I) acute audiogenic seizures (only one acoustic stimulus, without previous seizure experience before of the odor test) and II) after AK (20 acoustic stimuli [2 daily] before of the protocol test). We observed a decrease in the seizure severity index of animals exposed only to TOL in both conditions, with TOL presented 20s before the acoustic stimulation in both protocols. These findings were confirmed by behavioral sequential analysis (neuroethology), which clearly indicated an exacerbation of clusters of specific behaviors such as exploration and grooming (self-cleaning), as well as significant decrease in the expression of brainstem and limbic seizures in response to TOL. Thus, these data demonstrate that TOL, a strong olfactory stimulus, has anticonvulsant properties, detected by the decrease of acute and AK seizures in WARs.",

abstract = "Epilepsy surgery has seen numerous technological advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in recent years. This has increased the number of patients who may be candidates for intervention and potential improvement in quality of life. However, the expansion of the field also necessitates a broader understanding of how to incorporate both traditional and emerging technologies into the care provided at comprehensive epilepsy centers. This review summarizes both old and new surgical procedures in epilepsy using an example algorithm. While treatment algorithms are inherently oversimplified, incomplete, and reflect personal bias, they provide a general framework that can be customized to each center and each patient, incorporating differences in provider opinion, patient preference, and the institutional availability of technologies. For instance, the use of minimally invasive stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) has increased dramatically over the past decade, but many cases still benefit from invasive recordings using subdural grids. Furthermore, although surgical resection remains the gold-standard treatment for focal mesial temporal or neocortical epilepsy, ablative procedures such as laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be appropriate and avoid craniotomy in many cases. Furthermore, while palliative surgical procedures were once limited to disconnection surgeries, several neurostimulation treatments are now available to treat eloquent cortical, bitemporal, and even multifocal or generalized epilepsy syndromes. An updated perspective in epilepsy surgery will help guide surgical decision making and lay the groundwork for data collection needed in future studies and trials.",

abstract = "AbstractObjective Autonomic dysregulation is a possible pathomechanism of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Cardiac arrhythmias and autonomic symptoms are most commonly associated with seizures arising from the temporal lobes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether simultaneous seizure activity in both temporal lobes affects the autonomic nervous system differently from seizure activity in one temporal lobe as assessed by heart rate variability (HRV). Methods Electrocardiography (ECG) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data from 13 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy who had seizures that propagated electrically from one temporal lobe to the other during video-EEG--ECG monitoring were retrospectively reviewed. The time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear parameters of HRV were evaluated by analyzing 4-minute-long ECG epochs, sampling from baseline, preictal and postictal periods as well as epochs constituting unitemporal and bitemporal ictal activity. Results Heart rate was significantly higher during bitemporal ictal activity compared with all other time points. The time domain and nonlinear parameters of HRV were significantly decreased during bitemporal activity compared with baseline, and multiple components of HRV (standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), coefficient of variation (CV), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and standard deviation of short-term variability (SD1)) were significantly lower during bitemporal activity compared with unitemporal activity. Frequency domain analysis showed no significant differences. Conclusion This study shows that bitemporal seizure activity significantly increases heart rate and decreases HRV, indicating increased autonomic imbalance with a shift towards sympathetic predominance, and this may increase the risk of SUDEP.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent reports of fatal or near-fatal events in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) and an increasing awareness of the effects of seizures on breathing have stimulated interest in cardiorespiratory monitoring for patients undergoing video-electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Patient and provider acceptance of these extra recording devices has not previously been studied and may represent a barrier to widespread adoption. METHODS: We queried EMU subjects regarding their experiences with a monitoring protocol that included the continuous measurement of oral/nasal airflow, respiratory effort (chest and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography), oxygen saturation, and transcutaneous CO2. Surveys were returned by 71.4\% (100/140) of eligible subjects. RESULTS: Overall, 73\% of participants reported being moderately to highly satisfied with the monitoring, and 82\% reported moderate to strong agreement that advance knowledge of the monitoring would not have changed their decision to proceed with the video-EEG study. Except for nasal airflow, none of the additional monitoring devices caused more discomfort than EEG electrodes. CONCLUSION: Patient acceptance of an EMU comprehensive cardiorespiratory monitoring protocol is high. The information obtained from ``multimodality recording'' should help clinicians and investigators understand the effect of seizures on both cardiac and respiratory physiology, may enhance safety in the EMU, and may aid in the identification of biomarkers for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate adult patient or caregiver feelings and viewpoints about sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) awareness. BACKGROUND: The decision to discuss SUDEP with patients and families has created much debate. Many healthcare providers (HCPs) are hesitant to discuss SUDEP because of the perception of evoking unnecessary fear in patients while others argue that informing patients about SUDEP may enhance patient compliance, improve seizure control, and aid in saving lives. This study quantifies patient viewpoints regarding their right to information, requirements of disclosure, and initial responses of fear and patient motivation toward behavioral change. DESIGN/METHODS: This was a prospective random sample survey of adult patients with epilepsy or their caregivers. Every third eligible adult patient with epilepsy or caregiver was given a one-page SUDEP information sheet promoted by the Epilepsy Foundation of America. Participants were then asked if they were interested in completing an eight-item questionnaire assessing their perception of the information. RESULTS: Ninety-four of ninety-six subjects completed the survey (98\%). One hundred percent (n = 94) of responders felt they had a right to be informed about SUDEP, and 95\% felt that their HCP should be required to inform them. Respondents also indicated that SUDEP awareness motivated them for better medication adherence (89\%) and management of lifestyle factors that lower seizure threshold (88\%). Thirty percent endorsed increased fear. However, 100\% of those patients or caregivers who endorsed fear still felt it was their right to be informed. Patients who endorsed fear were also more likely to be interested in nonpharmacologic treatment options as a result of SUDEP disclosure. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and caregivers feel it is their right to be informed about SUDEP, irrespective of evoked fear. The vast majority of participants endorsed a requirement for HCPs to disclose related information. While some participants endorsed fear, most agreed that SUDEP awareness motivated them to better manage factors that trigger seizures. Patient education regarding SUDEP may play a key role in encouraging modifying lifestyle factors that lower seizure threshold and facilitate more aggressive interventions in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy.",

Using intracranial electrodes and a cranially implanted device, RNS \textregistered{} provides on-demand electrical cortical stimulation to reduce seizures. A randomized, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial demonstrated seizure reduction compared with sham stimulation. Seizure reduction was improved and sustained over years in a long-term treatment trial. The RNS \textregistered{} provides chronic ambulatory electrographic monitoring over years giving unprecedented insight into epilepsy dynamics. Studies to date have looked at the length of time to detecting bilateral seizure onsets in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), demonstrated biorhythms in interictal epileptiform activity over varied time scales, and shown promise in early detection of benefits of adding a new antiepileptic drug.

This study aimed to prospectively assess the following: (i) the prevalence of specific and nonspecific interictal psychiatric comorbidities in a population of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and (ii) the influence of epilepsy lateralization and localization on these psychiatric comorbidities. In this prospective monocentric study, we collected demographic data, characteristics of the epilepsy, interictal psychiatric comorbidities, mood, anxiety, and alexithymia dimensions. We used criteria from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV ( DSM IV) (Mini International Mental Interview (MINI)), diagnosis criteria for specific comorbidities, and validated mood and anxiety scales (general and specific for epilepsy). Among the 87 enrolled patients (39 males, 48 females), 52.9\% had at least one psychiatric comorbidity. The most common comorbidity was anxiety disorder (28.7\% according to the MINI, and 38.4\% screening by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD 7)). Mood disorders were the second most frequent psychiatric comorbidity: 21.8\% of our patients had interictal dysphoric disorders (IDDs), 16.1\% presented major depressive disorders according to the MINI, and 17.2\% screening by the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDIE). Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy had a higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities than patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy (p = 0.002), which is probably related to a higher rate of anxiety disorders in this subgroup (p = 0.012). Prevalence of psychiatric disorders prior to epilepsy in patients was higher in right- than in left-sided epilepsy (p = 0.042). No difference was found according to limbic involvement at seizure onset. Overall, this article highlighted a very high proportion of anxiety disorders in these patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and the necessity to systematically detect them and thus lead to a specific treatment.",

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major contributor to epilepsy-related mortality. It is associated with nocturnal seizures and centrally mediated postictal cardiorespiratory dysfunction (CRD), but mechanisms and contributors remain poorly understood. METHODS: We performed a prospective, cross-sectional, observational pilot study in the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) adult epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) to explore relationships between periictal CRD, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), neuroendocrine function, and clinical SUDEP risk. Thirty patients (twenty women, ten men) underwent video-electroencephalogram (EEG) with electrocardiogram (EKG) and digital pulse oximetry, inpatient or outpatient polysomnography (PSG), and comprehensive laboratory evaluation of sex steroid hormones. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy risk was defined as Low (0-2) or High ($\geq$3) using the revised SUDEP-7 Inventory. Sleep-disordered breathing was defined using standard criteria. Neuroendocrine dysfunction was defined as $\geq$1 laboratory abnormality. RESULTS: Cardiorespiratory dysfunction occurred more frequently in high-risk patients (60\% vs. 27\%, p = 0.018). Endocrine dysfunction was seen in 35\% of patients, more in men (p = 0.018). Sleep-disordered breathing was found in 88\% of fully scoreable PSGs. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant relationship between CRD, SDB, and neuroendocrine status, though all PSGs in those with high SUDEP risk or neuroendocrine dysfunction revealed SDB. Larger studies are needed to further elucidate relationships between CRD, SDB, neuroendocrine factors, and SUDEP.",

abstract = "Several studies found high prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders in patients with pure psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Traumatic experiences were also reported to be elevated in patients with PNES and were discussed as a crucial risk factor for the development of PNES. Much less is known about psychiatric comorbidities and specifically, about trauma history in patients with PNES and coexisting epilepsy. Here, we aimed at directly comparing psychiatric disorders and traumatic life experiences in patients with pure PNES and in patients with PNES and coexisting epilepsy. We assessed the presence of current axes I and II disorders in 109 patients with either pure PNES (n = 67) or with PNES + epilepsy (n = 42) by using structured clinical interviews. We also compared the trauma histories by using the posttraumatic diagnostic scale (PDS) as an interview and the extent of physical, sexual, and emotional childhood maltreatment measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Patients of both groups had very high rates of psychiatric disorders: 79.1\% of the patients with pure PNES and 76.2\% of the patients with PNES + epilepsy had at least one psychiatric disorder. The frequencies of psychiatric disorders did not differ between groups. However, there was a trend towards higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with PNES (32.9\%) compared with patients with PNES + epilepsy (16.7\%). In both groups, the proportion of patients who recalled traumatic events in the PDS was high (72.6\% in the patients with pure PNES, 64.3\% in the patients with PNES + epilepsy) and did not differ significantly between groups. The age at first traumatization, the types of trauma events experienced, the number of patients with single traumatization, and those with repeated traumatic experiences also did not differ between groups. We found high frequencies of childhood maltreatment in both groups. Our findings show that patients with PNES and patients with PNES and coexisting epilepsy could neither be differentiated by the amount of psychiatric additional disorders nor by the nature and extent of trauma and maltreatment experiences. Our results suggest that patients with PNES + epilepsy rather resemble patients with pure PNES than patients with epilepsy in respect to psychopathological characteristics and adverse life experiences. Trauma and maltreatment history are therefore assumed to be predisposing factors to PNES in both patients with pure PNES and patients with PNES and coexisting epilepsy.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: Differentiating between Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet SCN1A-related phenotypes is important for prognosis regarding epilepsy severity, cognitive development, and comorbidities. When a child is diagnosed with genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) or febrile seizures (FS), accurate prognostic information is essential as well, but detailed information on seizure course, seizure freedom, medication use, and comorbidities is lacking for this milder patient group. In this cross-sectional study, we explore disease characteristics in milder SCN1A-related phenotypes and the nature, occurrence, and relationships of SCN1A-related comorbidities in both patients with Dravet and non-Dravet syndromes. METHODS: A cohort of 164 Dutch participants with SCN1A-related seizures was evaluated, consisting of 116 patients with Dravet syndrome and 48 patients with either GEFS+, febrile seizures plus (FS+), or FS. Clinical data were collected from medical records, semi-structured telephone interviews, and three questionnaires: the Functional Mobility Scale (FMS), the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Measurement Model, and the Child or Adult Behavior Checklists (CBCL/ABCL). RESULTS: Walking disabilities and severe behavioral problems affect 71\% and 43\% of patients with Dravet syndrome respectively and are almost never present in patients with non-Dravet syndromes. These comorbidities are strongly correlated to lower quality-of-life (QoL) scores. Less severe comorbidities occur in patients with non-Dravet syndromes: learning problems and psychological/behavioral problems are reported for 27\% and 38\% respectively. The average QoL score of the non-Dravet group was comparable with that of the general population. The majority of patients with non-Dravet syndromes becomes seizure-free after 10 years of age (85\%). CONCLUSIONS: Severe behavioral problems and walking disabilities are common in patients with Dravet syndrome and should receive specific attention during clinical management. Although the epilepsy course of patients with non-Dravet syndromes is much more favorable, milder comorbidities frequently occur in this group as well. Our results may be of great value for clinical care and informing newly diagnosed patients and their parents about prognosis.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in a tertiary epilepsy center in the years 1981-2016 with an emphasis on patient supervision and nursing intervention in different departments. METHODS: We identified 14 SUDEP cases (probable, definite, definite plus). Patient-years (PY) and incidence were calculated for the periods of six years for the general epileptology wards (adults and children) and, in addition, for the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) since 1990. RESULTS: The incidence of SUDEP showed a decreasing trend over time (r = -0.81; p = 0.053, two-sided; Pearson correlation coefficient). This is especially true in children (no SUDEP occurred in pediatric general epileptology since 1992). Additionally, in the EMU (314 PY since the start of 1990), no SUDEP occurred. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy incidence was highest (6.8/1000 PY) in the early time periods (1981-1992) and lowest (1.7/1000 PY) in the later time periods (1999-2010). In the general epileptology wards (3579 PY), the overall incidence was 3.9 per 1000 PY (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-6.6). CONCLUSIONS: We assume that the decreased SUDEP incidence is an effect of better supervision by the use of technical means (e.g., video cameras, pulse oximeters, seizure detection systems) and rooming-in of parents or family.",

In this study, we investigated if high frequency (HF) DBS in the dorsal peduncular cortex (DPC) alleviates depressive-like behavior in an experimental model of depression. Surprisingly, HF DBS in the DPC caused acute induction of seizures in ~40\% of animals stimulated with clinically relevant stimulation parameters. Reducing the stimulation's amplitude by 50\% did not alter seizure occurrence. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings showed seizures up to Racine stage IV lasting up to 4 min after cessation of stimulation. We conclude that HF DBS in the DPC is not suitable for mood-related experiments in rats but could be a potential model for seizure induction.",

Currently, there is no systematic approach in the evaluation and management of psychiatric comorbidities in these patients. In addition, neurologists are not trained to recognize these disorders, and consequently, they remain undertreated. Despite the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in patients evaluated for epilepsy surgery, most epilepsy centers in North America do not include a psychiatric evaluation as part of the presurgical work-up. Despite the intimate relationship between psychiatric comorbidities and epilepsy, collaboration between epileptologists and psychiatrists is sparse at best and nonexistent at worse.

Seizures result in autonomic and respiratory dysfunction, leading to sympathetic hyperactivity and respiratory distress, including apnea. While the heart is vulnerable to catecholamine surges and hypoxia, it remains unknown if repetitive generalized seizures lead to cardiac damage. DBA/1 mice exhibit seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) following generalized audiogenic seizures (AGS), which can be resuscitated using a rodent ventilator. In the current study, we induced different numbers of S-IRA episodes in DBA/1 mice and determined the association of repeated S-IRA induction with cardiac damage using histology. After repetitive induction of 18 S-IRA, calcified lesions, as revealed by calcium (Ca2+)-specific alizarin red staining, were observed in the ventricular myocardium in 61.5\% of DBA/1 mice, which was higher compared to mice with 5 S-IRA and 1 S-IRA as well as age-matched untested control mice. The incidence of lesions in mice with 9 S-IRA was only higher than that of control mice. Only 1-2, small lesions were observed in mice with 5 S-IRA and 1 S-IRA and in control mice. Larger lesions (>2500 $\mu$m2) were observed in mice with 9 and 18 S-IRA. The incidence of larger lesions was higher in mice with 18 S-IRA (53.8\%) as compared to mice with 5 S-IRA and 1 S-IRA as well as with control mice, and the incidence of larger lesions in mice with 9 S-IRA was only higher than that of control mice. Repeated induction of S-IRA in DBA/1 mice can result in calcified necrotic lesions in the ventricles of the heart, and their incidence and size are dependent on the total number of S-IRA.",

Presurgical T1-weighted MPRAGE, standard T1, T2 and FLAIR sequences were compared with postsurgical MRI by a neuroradiologist and classified as type 0 (no involvement of insula), type 1 (minimal involvement of insular margin), type 2 (insular involvement <25\%), and type 3 (insular involvement $\geq$25\%). Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) was carried out in pre- and postoperative video-electroencephalography (vEEG) recording. Time-domain parameters were calculated: (mean of the RR intervals (MNN), root mean square difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), standard deviation of the RR intervals (SDNN), and coefficient of variation (CV)). In addition, frequency-domain parameters were calculated: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (14 females) with mean age of 36.2 $\pm$ 14.4 years (30; 22-75) were studied.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Ictal (ICA) and postconvulsive central apnea (PCCA) have been implicated in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) pathomechanisms. Previous studies suggest that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and benzodiazepines (BZDs) may influence breathing. The aim of this study was to investigate if chronic use of these drugs alters central apnea occurrence in patients with epilepsy. METHODS: Patients with epilepsy admitted to epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in nine centers participating in a SUDEP study were consented. Polygraphic physiological parameters were analyzed, including video-electroencephalography (VEEG), thoracoabdominal excursions, and pulse oximetry. Outpatient medication details were collected. Patients and seizures were divided into SRI, BZD, and control (no SRI or BZD) groups. Ictal central apnea and PCCA, hypoxemia, and electroclinical features were assessed for each group. RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-six seizures were analyzed (204 patients). The relative risk (RR) for ICA in the SRI group was half that of the control group (p = 0.02). In the BZD group, ICA duration was significantly shorter than in the control group (p = 0.02), as was postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) duration (p = 0.021). Both SRI and BZD groups were associated with smaller seizure-associated oxygen desaturation (p = 0.009; p ≪ 0.001). Neither presence nor duration of PCCA was significantly associated with SRI or BZD (p ≫ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Seizures in patients taking SRIs have lower occurrence of ICA, and patients on chronic treatment with BZDs have shorter ICA and PGES durations. Preventing or shortening ICA duration by using SRIs and/or BZD in patients with epilepsy may play a possible role in SUDEP risk reduction.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: We prospectively validated stereo-electroencephalography (EEG) electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) of language against a reference standard of meta-analytic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) framework (Neurosynth). METHODS: Language ESM was performed using 50 Hz, biphasic, bipolar, stimulation at 1-8 mA, with a picture naming task. Electrode contacts (ECs) were scored as ESM+ if ESM interfered with speech/language function. For each patient, presurgical MRI was transformed to a standard space and coregistered with computed tomographic (CT) scan to obtain EC locations. After whole-brain parcellation, this fused image data were intersected with three-dimensional language fMRI (Neurosynth), and each EC was classified as lying within/outside the fMRI language parcel. Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and other indices were estimated. Current thresholds for language inhibition and after-discharges (ADs) were analyzed using multivariable linear mixed models. RESULTS: In 10 patients (5 females), aged 5.4-21.2 years, speech/language inhibition was noted with ESM on 87/304 (29\%) ECs. Stereo-EEG language ESM was a valid classifier of fMRI (Neurosynth) language sites (DOR: 9.02, p < 0.0001), with high specificity (0.87) but poor sensitivity (0.57). Similar diagnostic indices were seen for ECs in frontal or posterior regions, and gray or white matter.

author = "Panelli, Rosemary J and O'Brien, Terence J",
abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to identify where epilepsy or seizures may be the underlying cause of death but not identified by the death certification process in the Australian coronial system and to better characterize such deaths. METHODS: Australian National Coronial Information System (NCIS) closed cases for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) (population average 348,000) over 13 years were searched using cause of death, and a text search of police and autopsy reports, to identify all deaths where epilepsy or seizures were mentioned. Deaths where the underlying cause of death was not seizures or epilepsy were excluded (including suicide). The remaining cases (75) were categorized by the circumstances of death. Suspected sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) cases were further classified using the unified definition of SUDEP of Nashef and colleagues (2012). RESULTS: Of the final 75 cases, only 44 were found by the cause of death search. Key word document searches found another 31. Cases were classified as Definite SUDEP (37), Definite SUDEP Plus (10), Probable SUDEP (1), Possible SUDEP (3), Near SUDEP (4), Near SUDEP Plus (1), Asphyxia (3), Treatment-related (1), Head injury (2), Drowning (2), motor vehicle accident (MVA) (1), deaths related to a single convulsive seizure (6), and status epilepticus (SE) (4). Cases were 80\% male. CONCLUSIONS: Epilepsy and seizure-related deaths are underreported in the Australian Coronial system. Enhanced documentation of the causal chain of events leading to deaths would increase recognition. Using the unified SUDEP definition would expand SUDEP identification.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. Human studies and animal models suggest that respiratory arrest is the initiating event leading to death in many cases of SUDEP. It has previously been reported that the onset of apnea can coincide with the spread of seizures to the amygdala, and apnea can be reproduced by electrical stimulation of the amygdala. The aim of the current work was to determine if the amygdala is required for seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) in a mouse model of SUDEP. Experiments were performed on DBA/1 mice that have audiogenic seizures with a high incidence of fatal postictal respiratory arrest. Electrolytic lesions of the amygdala significantly reduced the incidence of S-IRA without altering seizures, baseline breathing, or the hypercapnic ventilatory response. These results indicate that the amygdala is a critical node in a pathway to the lower brainstem that is needed for seizures to cause respiratory arrest. Significance statement Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is the most common cause of mortality in patients with refractory epilepsy, and S-IRA is thought to be important in the pathophysiology in many cases. In a patient with epilepsy, the onset of apnea has been shown to coincide with spread of seizures to the amygdala, and in multiple patients, apnea was induced by stimulation of the amygdala. Here, we show that lesions of the amygdala reduced the incidence of S-IRA and death in a mouse model of SUDEP. These results provide evidence that the amygdala may be a critical node in the pathway by which seizures influence the brainstem respiratory network to cause apnea.

abstract = "Over the last few years, there has been significant expansion of wearable technologies and devices into the health sector, including for conditions such as epilepsy. Although there is significant potential to benefit patients, there is a paucity of well-conducted scientific research in order to inform patients and healthcare providers of the most appropriate technology. In addition to either directly or indirectly identifying seizure activity, the ideal device should improve quality of life and reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Devices typically monitor a number of parameters including electroencephalographic (EEG), cardiac, and respiratory patterns and can detect movement, changes in skin conductance, and muscle activity. Multimodal devices are emerging with improved seizure detection rates and reduced false positive alarms. While convulsive seizures are reliably identified by most unimodal and multimodal devices, seizures associated with no, or minimal, movement are frequently undetected. The vast majority of current devices detect but do not actively intervene. At best, therefore, they indicate the presence of seizure activity in order to accurately ascertain true seizure frequency or facilitate intervention by others, which may, nevertheless, impact the rate of SUDEP. Future devices are likely to both detect and intervene within an autonomous closed-loop system tailored to the individual and by self-learning from the analysis of patient-specific parameters. The formulation of standards for regulatory bodies to validate seizure detection devices is also of paramount importance in order to confidently ascertain the performance of a device; and this will be facilitated by the creation of a large, open database containing multimodal annotated data in order to test device algorithms.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Patients' education is the most relevant contributor to patient self-management of epilepsy. We aimed to assess the acquisition of knowledge after a semi-structured interview. METHODS: We performed a quasi-experimental prospective study with a cohort of patients with epilepsy admitted for prolonged video electroencephalogram (VEEG). We measured patients' baseline knowledge with a 10-item true-false test (test A). Then, a qualified nurse carried out a semi-structured interview. We measured acquired knowledge with another 10-item true-false exam (test B), prior to VEEG discharge and after a 3- to 5-month follow-up, and we compared the difference between the scores in test A and test B. Finally, we conducted a satisfaction and suitability survey on the interview at follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients participated, half were women. Their median age was 39.5, and the median length of schooling was 14 years. The median time since epilepsy onset was 13 years, 75\% had suffered tonic-clonic seizures. The median score on test A was 7, while the median score on test B was 8.5 (p < 0.001) both at VEEG discharge and after follow-up. After the interview, 84.4\% of participants reported that they were very satisfied with the information received; 87.5\% stated that they had not previously heard about SUDEP (sudden unexpected dead in epilepsy); and 93.8\% considered it important to receive detailed information about SUDEP. CONCLUSIONS: Patient education through a semi-structured comprehensive interview improves knowledge of patients with epilepsy about their disease. The calm atmosphere and the qualified nursing working at VEEG units make them an appropriate setting for talking about epilepsy and its risks, including SUDEP.",

abstract = "Brainstem raphe (BR) hypoechogenicity in transcranial sonography (TCS) has been depicted in patients with depression. But, up to date, the association of BR alterations in TCS with depression in patients with epilepsy has never been reported. This study was to investigate the possible role of BR examination via TCS in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures (IGE-TCS) and depression. Forty-six patients with IGE-TCS and 45 healthy controls were recruited. Echogenicity of the caudate nuclei (CN), lentiform nuclei (LN), substantia nigra (SN), and BR and widths of the lateral ventricle (LV) frontal horns and the third ventricle (TV) were assessed via TCS. The determination of depression was based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV), and depression severity measured by Chinese version Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (C-NDDI-E) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The width of TV in patients with epilepsy was found significantly larger than that in healthy controls (p = 0.001), but there was no significant difference in TV width between patients with IGE-TCS with and without depression. There were no significant differences between patients with IGE-TCS and healthy controls in LV frontal horn width, as well as in SN, CN, LN, and BR echogenicity. Here, it seems that patients with IGE-TCS were detected with smaller SN echogenic area compared with controls though they had no statistical significance. Patients with IGE-TCS with hypoechogenic BR had significantly higher C-NDDI-E and BDI-II scores than those with normal BR signal, and most patients with IGE-TCS with depression exhibited hypoechogenic BR, but few patients with IGE-TCS without depression exhibited hypoechogenic BR. In conclusion, BR echogenic signal alterations in TCS can be a biomarker for depression in epilepsy, but it might not be associated with epilepsy itself. The alterations of SN echogenic area and TV width in TCS may reflect a potential role of SN and diencephalon structure in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, which needs to be further elucidated.",

author = "Auzmendi, Jer{\'o}nimo and Akyuz, Enes and Lazarowski, Alberto",
abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the major cause of death that affects patients with epilepsy. The risk of SUDEP increases according to the frequency and severity of uncontrolled seizures; therefore, SUDEP risk is higher in patients with refractory epilepsy (RE), in whom most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are ineffective for both seizure control and SUDEP prevention. Consequently, RE and SUDEP share a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, which is mainly associated with brain overexpression of ABC-transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The activity of P-gp can also contribute to membrane depolarization and affect the normal function of neurons and cardiomyocytes. Other molecular regulators of membrane potential are the inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir), whose genetic variants have been related to both epilepsy and heart dysfunctions. Although it has been suggested that dysfunctions of the cardiac, respiratory, and brainstem arousal systems are the causes of SUDEP, the molecular basis for explaining its dysfunctions remain unknown. In rats, repetitive seizures or status epilepticus induced high expression of P-gp and loss Kir expression in the brain and heart, and promoted membrane depolarization, malignant bradycardia, and the high rate of mortality. Here we reviewed clinical and experimental evidences suggesting that abnormal expression of depolarizing/repolarizing factors as P-gp and Kir could favor persistent depolarization of membranes without any rapid functional recovery capacity. This condition induced by convulsive stress could be the molecular mechanism leading to acquired severe bradycardia, as an ineffective heart response generating the appropriate scenario for SUDEP development.

abstract = "Dravet syndrome is an intractable pediatric epilepsy associated with SCN1A mutations. In addition to having a large seizure burden and a reduced lifespan, patients with Dravet syndrome also exhibit delays in reaching normal developmental milestones in attentional, emotional, and cognitive function. These developmental delays manifest in autistic-like social withdrawal and compulsive behavior. Additionally, cognitive impairments including deficits in sensorimotor processing and memory function are present. Several mouse models utilizing heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/− mice) have been generated that recapitulate many aspects of Dravet syndrome. Studies in these mouse models of Dravet syndrome have characterized behavioral phenotypes in adult mice. In the present study, we characterized the behavioral phenotype of Scn1a+/− mice generated by targeted deletion of Scn1a exon 1 (Scn1atm1Kea) during adolescence. Identifying behavioral deficits in adolescent mice would more closely model the early onset of attentional, emotional, and cognitive delays observed in patients with Dravet syndrome. The behaviors of adolescent Scn1a+/− and wildtype (WT) mice were compared across several behavioral domains. We assessed motor function (open-field test), sociability and social recognition memory (three-chambered social preference and social interaction tests), memory function (novel object recognition, Barnes maze, fear conditioning paradigm), anxiety-related behavior (elevated plus maze and open-field thigmotaxis), startle reflex and sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI) tests), and repetitive compulsive behavior (marble burying test). Adolescent Scn1a+/− mice exhibited normal locomotor activity, marble burying behavior, sociability, and sensorimotor gating. However, adolescent Scn1a+/− mice displayed increased anxiety-related thigmotactic behavior, atypical fear expression, blunted acoustic startle responses, and impaired social recognition and spatial memory. Our results show that Scn1a+/− mice display various behavioral impairments during adolescence, which provides a foundation for testing early intervention therapies targeting developmental delays modeled in Dravet syndrome mice.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Strong olfactory stimulation (OS) with such substances as toluene or ammonia has been reported to suppress seizures. We aimed to investigate the role of ammonia stimulation on acute kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. We also investigated any possible effects of ammonia stimulation on the electrophysiology of the anterior piriform cortex (APC). METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with bilateral hippocampal electrodes and an electrode in the left APC. Animals were exposed to either distilled water (control) or ammonia stimulation for 20 s every 5 min during KA induction of status epilepticus (SE). The electroencephalogram (EEG) was analyzed for seizure frequency, duration, severity, and total KA doses given prior to reaching SE. Seizure-free EEG epochs that coincided with OS were chosen and analyzed via wavelet analysis for any spectral changes. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in seizure frequency, duration, severity, or administered KA doses before SE between the groups. In the experimental group, a wavelet analysis of variance (WANOVA) revealed a significant stimulation-induced increase of power in the delta and alpha bands prior to the first KA injection and higher power in the delta and theta bands after KA injection. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the spectral analysis of the APC revealed specific OS-induced changes, our findings suggest that OS with ammonia does not result in altering the threshold of attaining KA-induced SE. This does not rule out a potential role for OS in reducing recurrent seizures in the KA or other epilepsy models.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Adjunctive fenfluramine hydrochloride, classically described as acting pharmacologically through a serotonergic mechanism, has demonstrated a unique and robust clinical response profile with regard to its magnitude, consistency, and durability of effect on seizure activity in patients with pharmacoresistant Dravet syndrome. Recent findings also support long-term improvements in executive functions (behavior, emotion, cognition) in these patients. The observed clinical profile is inconsistent with serotonergic activity alone, as other serotonergic medications have not been demonstrated to have these clinical effects. This study investigated a potential role for $\sigma$1 receptor activity in complementing fenfluramine's serotonergic pharmacology. METHODS: Radioligand binding assays tested the affinity of fenfluramine for 47 receptors associated with seizures in the literature, including $\sigma$ receptors. Cellular function assays tested fenfluramine and norfenfluramine (its major metabolite) activity at various receptors, including adrenergic, muscarinic, and serotonergic receptors. The $\sigma$1 receptor activity was assessed by the mouse vas deferens isometric twitch and by an assay of dissociation of the $\sigma$1 receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum stress protein binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). In vivo mouse models assessed fenfluramine activity at $\sigma$1 receptors in ameliorating dizocilpine-induced learning deficits in spatial and nonspatial memory tasks, alone or in combination with the reference $\sigma$1 receptor agonist PRE-084. RESULTS: Fenfluramine and norfenfluramine bound $\geq$30\% to $\beta$2-adrenergic, muscarinic M1, serotonergic 5-HT1A, and $\sigma$ receptors, as well as sodium channels, with a Ki between 266 nM ($\sigma$ receptors) and 17.5 $\mu$M ($\beta$-adrenergic receptors). However, only $\sigma$1 receptor isometric twitch assays showed a positive functional response, with weak stimulation by fenfluramine and inhibition by norfenfluramine. Fenfluramine, but not the 5-HT2C agonist lorcaserin, showed a positive modulation of the PRE-084-induced dissociation of $\sigma$1 protein from BiP. Fenfluramine also showed dose-dependent antiamnesic effects against dizocilpine-induced learning deficits in spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance responses, which are models of $\sigma$1 activation. Moreover, low doses of fenfluramine synergistically potentiated the low-dose effect of PRE-084, confirming a positive modulatory effect at the $\sigma$1 receptor. Finally, all in vivo effects were blocked by the $\sigma$1 receptor antagonist NE-100. SIGNIFICANCE: Fenfluramine demonstrated modulatory activity at $\sigma$1 receptors in vitro and in vivo in addition to its known serotonergic activity. These studies identify a possible new $\sigma$1 receptor mechanism underpinning fenfluramine's central nervous system effects, which may contribute to its antiseizure activity in Dravet syndrome and positive effects observed on executive functions in clinical studies.",

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the knowledge of parents of the CWE regarding SUDEP in the tertiary setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 146 parents (108 female) aged 19 to 55 years (median age:34) of CWE were included at Marmara University, School of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Neurology outpatient clinic between May 2018 and September 2018. A total of 30 multiple-choice questions and a written survey were administered, which consisted of three sections. In the first section, the sociodemographics of parents and CWE were questioned. In the second section, the severity of epilepsy was evaluated. In the third section, the knowledge level and awareness of parents of CWE were assessed. RESULTS: Of 146 parents, only 16.6\% previously heard about SUDEP, while 45\% of them heard from their relatives. The presence of prior knowledge of SUDEP was associated with the presence of prolonged postictal confusion and longer duration of epilepsy (p < 0.05). Ninety-seven (66\%) parents desired to be informed about SUDEP, while 76 (54.7\%) of them agreed that this information should be given at the time of diagnosis. The degree of anxiety in parents regarding death of epilepsy-related causes was significantly related with prolonged postictal confusion (p < 0.001) and using three or more antiepileptic drugs (p = 0.005).

However, a comprehensive understanding of cardiorespiratory function in the preictal, ictal, and postictal periods are lacking. METHODS: We examined continuous cardiorespiratory and autonomic function in 157 seizures (18 convulsive and 139 nonconvulsive) from 70 consecutive patients who had a seizure captured on concurrent video-encephalogram (EEG) monitoring and polysomnography between February 1, 2012 and May 31, 2017. Heart and respiratory rates, heart rate variability (HRV), and oxygen saturation were assessed across four distinct periods: baseline (120 s), preictal (60 s), ictal, and postictal (300 s). Heart and respiratory rates were further followed for up to 60 min after seizure termination to assess return to baseline. RESULTS: Ictal tachycardia occurred during both convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures, but the maximum rate was higher for convulsive seizures (mean: 138.8 beats/min, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 125.3-152.4) compared with nonconvulsive seizures (mean: 105.4 beats/min, 95\% CI: 101.2-109.6; p < 0.001). Convulsive seizures were associated with a lower ictal minimum respiratory rate (mean: 0 breaths/min, 95\% CI: 0-0) compared with nonconvulsive seizures (mean: 11.0 breaths/min, 95\% CI: 9.5-12.6; p < 0.001). Ictal obstructive apnea was associated with convulsive compared with nonconvulsive seizures. The low-frequency (LF) power band of ictal HRV was higher among convulsive seizures than nonconvulsive seizures (ratio of means (ROM): 2.97, 95\% CI: 1.34-6.60; p = 0.008). Postictal tachycardia was substantially prolonged, characterized by a longer return to baseline for convulsive seizures (median: 60.0 min, interquartile range (IQR): 46.5-60.0) than nonconvulsive seizures (median: 0.26 min, IQR: 0.008-0.9; p < 0.001). For postictal hyperventilation, the return to baseline was longer in convulsive seizures (median: 25.3 min, IQR: 8.1-60) than nonconvulsive seizures (median: 1.0 min, IQR: 0.07-3.2; p < 0.001). The LF power band of postictal HRV was lower in convulsive seizures than nonconvulsive seizures (ROM: 0.33, 95\% CI: 0.11-0.96; p = 0.043). Convulsive seizures with postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES; n = 12) were associated with lower postictal heart and respiratory rate, and increased HRV, compared with those without (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: Profound cardiorespiratory and autonomic dysfunction associated with convulsive seizures may explain why these seizures carry the greatest risk of SUDEP.",

abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective The objective of the study was to examine the frequency and characteristics of ictal central apnea (ICA) in a selective cohort of patients with mesial or neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing surface video-electroencephalography (EEG) and multimodal recording of cardiorespiratory parameters. Methods We retrospectively screened 453 patients who underwent EEG in a single center including nasal airflow measurements, respiratory inductance plethysmography of thoracoabdominal excursions, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, and electrocardiography. Patients with confirmed TLE subtype, either by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions limited to the temporal neocortex or mesial structures and concordant neurophysiologic data, or patients who underwent invasive explorations were included. Results Ictal central apnea frequency and characteristics were analyzed in 41 patients with 164 seizures that had multimodal respiratory monitoring. The total occurrence of ICA in all seizures in this cohort was 79.9\%. No significant difference was seen between mesial and neocortical temporal lobe seizures (79.8\% and 80.0\%, respectively). Ictal central apnea preceded EEG onset by 13 $\pm$ 11 s in 33.3\% of seizures and was the first clinical sign by 18 $\pm$ 14 s in 48.7\%. Longer ICA duration trended towards a more severe degree of hypoxemia. Conclusions In a selective cohort of TLE defined by MRI lesion and/or intracranial recordings, the frequency of ICA was higher than previously reported in the literature. Multimodal respiratory monitoring has localizing value and is generally well tolerated. Ictal central apnea preceded both EEG on scalp recordings as well as clinical seizure onset in a substantial number of patients. Respiratory monitoring and ICA detection is even more paramount during invasive monitoring to confirm that the recorded seizure onset is seen before the first clinical sign.",

We aimed to study metabolic changes on 18Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with focal to bilateral (generalized) seizures (GTCS) and PGES on stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). METHODS: We analyzed interictal brain metabolism in a group of 19 patients with widespread postictal suppression (PGES+) associated with SEEG-recorded GTCS. This group was compared to 25 patients without widespread suppression (PGES-) as defined by SEEG, matched for epilepsy localization and lateralization. Frequency of GTCS was observed to be higher in the PGES+ group (high risk group for SUDEP). Analysis of metabolic data was performed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM) on the whole-brain, and principal component analysis (PCA) on AAL (automated anatomical labeling) atlas. RESULTS: Statistical parametric mapping showed right temporal pole hypometabolism in the PGES+ group (T-score = 3.90; p < 0.001; k = 185), in comparison to the PGES- group. Principal component analysis showed association between the metabolic values of certain regions of interest and PGES+/PGES- groups, confirmed by a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the values of the right dorsal temporal pole and of the left temporal pole between the two groups. Principal component analysis showed two dimensions significantly related to the PGES+/PGES- partition, involving the following regions: right temporal pole, right parahippocampal gyrus, right Rolandic operculum, bilateral paracentral lobule, right precuneus, right thalamus, right caudate and pallidum, bilateral cerebellum, left temporal pole, left Heschl's gyrus, left calcarine region, and left caudate, with loss of connection in PGES+ patients. Metabolic differences were independent of epilepsy localization and lateralization and persisted after correction for GTCS frequency. SIGNIFICANCE: Interictal metabolic changes within a predominantly right-sided network involving temporal lobe and connected cortical and subcortical structures were seen in patients with frequent GTCS presenting widespread postictal suppression.",

The intervention program was performed at the gym of the Physical Education School/Federal University of Pelotas. A total of 21 people, aged 18-60 years, diagnosed with epilepsy and who were not engaged in systematic physical exercise in the last three months were divided into two groups: (1) exercise (EG) - 12 weeks of a structured physical exercise program; (2) control (CG) - no exercise and maintenance of usual activities. The allocation rate 1:1 was used. The exercise program consisted of two 60-min weekly sessions including warm-up (5-min), aerobic training (15-25 min at 14-17 on Borg scale), resistance training (2-3 sets, 10-15 repetitions), and stretching. Sociodemographic, clinical and health variables (frequency and number of seizures, quality of life, depression, anxiety, and side effects), anthropometrics (weight, height, hip and waist circumferences), cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), and strength (dynamometry) were measured at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and Bonferroni posthoc tests were used for the comparison between moments and groups. Eleven participants were randomized to EG and 10 to CG. One EG participant did not complete the study. There was a reduction in frequency of epileptic seizures during the 3-month intervention period in EG (p = 0.010) with no improvement in CG. Improvement in quality of life (p = 0.004), stress levels (p = 0.017) and physical fitness (p = 0.017) were also observed in the EG compared to CG.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent in patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) before and after anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). AIMS: (1) To follow the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms long-term after ATL among patients with refractory MTLE-HS; (2) To identify pre- and postsurgical variables associated with the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms after surgery. METHODS: We compared the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms determined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) before and long after ATL (mean 104 months, range 70-130) in 41 consecutive patients refractory MTLE-HS. The last follow-up was between September 2018 and March 2020. We also determined pre- and postsurgical variables independently associated with the HADS scores after surgery. RESULTS: The scores of HADS and its subdomains related to anxiety and depression decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after ATL. After multiple linear regressions, the HADS-Anxiety scores before surgery (B = 0.47, CI 95\% 0.20 to 0.75, p = 0.001) and at follow-up after surgery (B = 0.07, CI 0.00 to 0.14, p = 0.05) remain independently and positively associated with HADS-Anxiety scores after surgery. The HADS-Depression scores after surgery were independently positively associated with HADS-Depression scores before surgery (B = 0.39, CI 95\% 0.10 to 0.76, p = 0.01) and worse seizure control after surgery (B = 1.55, CI 95\% 0.23 to 2.87, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with MTLE-HS significantly improved after ATL. Presurgical levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively, were positively associated with the postsurgical levels of those symptoms. Length of follow-up is associated with anxiety, and worse seizure control is associated with depressive symptoms after ATL. The results have implications for the surgical management of MTLE-HS patients.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To describe morphological characteristics of the brainstem nuclei in response to chronic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with refractory epilepsy. BACKGROUND: VNS is a treatment option for individuals with medically refractory epilepsy. While treatment with VNS may achieve up to 50\% seizure reduction and is protective against sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Long-term structural and cellular changes in response to VNS have rarely been addressed in humans. METHODS: Four autopsy cases with history of chronic epilepsy treated with VNS (VNS+) and 4 age- and sex-matched chronic epilepsy-related death cases without VNS (VNS-) were included. Detailed clinical and postmortem data were obtained. Serial horizontal sections of the brainstem were prepared and stained with hematoxylin, eosin, and luxol fast blue (HE/LFB). Three regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated, including nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), locus coeruleus (LC), and the rostral pontine group of raphe nuclei (rRN). Immunohistochemistry studies were performed using antibodies to GFAP, NeuN, HLA-DR, and IBA-1. Immunolabeling index was analyzed. RESULTS: Three of the 4 VNS+ patients and all 4 control (VNS-) patients died of SUDEP. There was no laterality difference in the NeuN, GFAP, HLA-DR and IBA-1 expression in LC and NTS of VNS+ patients. Similarly, there was no difference in the rRN, LC, and NTS between the VNS+ and VNS- groups. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first histopathological study of the long-term effects of VNS therapy in the human brain. There was no difference observed in the neuronal cell number, degree of astrocytosis, and neuroinflammation in the main brainstem vagal afferent nuclei after prolonged VNS treatment in patients with refractory epilepsy.",

The goal of this study was to identify common patterns of objectively detected brain glucose metabolic abnormalities associated with SUDEP patients and those at high SUDEP risk. METHODS: Patients with refractory epilepsy (n = 78, age: 16-61 years, 44 females), who underwent comprehensive presurgical evaluation, were assessed for their risk of SUDEP using the revised SUDEP-7 inventory. From the 57 patients with low SUDEP risk, 35 were selected to match their demographic and clinical characteristics to those with high SUDEP risk (n = 21). [18F]fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) abnormalities were evaluated in the high- and low-SUDEP risk subgroups compared to FDG-PET scans of a healthy adult control group using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Individual FDG-PET scans of 4 additional patients, who died from SUDEP, were also analyzed by SPM. RESULTS: Mean SUDEP-7 score was 6.1 in the high and 2.7 in the low SUDEP risk group. MRI showed no lesion in 36 patients (64\%). Statistical parametric mapping analysis of the high SUDEP risk subgroup showed bilateral medial frontal and inferior frontal hypometabolism as a common pattern. The low-risk group showed no specific common metabolic abnormalities on SPM group analysis. Individual PET scans of all 4 patients who died from SUDEP also showed bilateral frontal lobe hypometabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that bilateral frontal lobe involvement on FDG-PET, especially the medial and inferior frontal cortex, may be a common metabolic pattern associated with high SUDEP risk and SUDEP itself, in patients with refractory focal epilepsy.",

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) are associated with elevated electrodermal activity (EDA) and postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression (PGES), markers that may indicate sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk. This study investigated the association of GTCS semiology, EDA, and PGES in children with epilepsy. METHODS: Patients admitted to the Boston Children's Hospital long-term video-EEG monitoring unit wore a sensor that records EDA. We selected patients with at least one GTCS and reviewed video-EEGs for semiology, tonic and clonic phase duration, total clinical seizure duration, electrographic onset, offset, and PGES. We grouped patients into three semiology classes: GTCS 1: bilateral symmetric tonic arm extension, GTCS 2: no specific tonic arm extension or flexion, GTCS 3: unilateral or asymmetrical arm extension, tonic arm flexion or posturing that does not fit into GTCS 1 or 2. We analyzed the correlation between semiology, EDA, and PGES, and measured the area under the curve (AUC) of the ictal EDA (seizure onset to one hour after), subtracting baseline EDA (one-hour seizure-free before seizure onset). Using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and linear regression, we analyzed all seizures and single episodes per patient. RESULTS: We included 30 patients (median age 13.8 $\pm$ 3.6 years, 46.7\% females) and 53 seizures. With GEE, GTCS 1 was associated with longer PGES duration compared to GTCS 2 (Estimate ($\beta$) = -26.32 s, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI): -36.46 to -16.18, p < 0.001), and the presence of PGES was associated with greater EDA change ($\beta$ = 429604 $\mu$S, 95\% CI: 3550.96 to 855657.04, p = 0.048). With single-episode analysis, GTCS 1 had greater EDA change than GTCS 2 (($\beta$ = -601339 $\mu$S, 95\% CI: -1167016.56 to -35661.44, p = 0.047). EDA increased with PGES presence ($\beta$ = 637500 $\mu$S, 95\% CI: 183571.84 to 1091428.16, p = 0.01) and duration ($\beta$ = 16794 $\mu$S, 95\% CI: 5729.8 to 27858.2, p = 0.006). Patients with GTCS 1 had longer PGES duration compared to GTCS 2 ($\beta$ = -30.53 s, 95\% CI: -44.6 to -16.46, p < 0.001) and GTCS 3 ($\beta$ = -22.07 s, 95\% CI: -38.95 to -5.19, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: In children with epilepsy, PGES correlates with greater ictal EDA. GTCS 1 correlated with longer PGES duration and may indirectly correlate with greater ictal EDA. Our study suggests potential applications in monitoring and preventing SUDEP in these patients.",

abstract = "Objective The effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), an important auxiliary therapy for treating drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), on autonomic nerve function is still controversial. Heart rate variability is a widely used indicator of autonomic nerve function. To clarify the relationship between VNS and heart rate variability (HRV), we performed a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the effect of VNS on HRV in patients with epilepsy. Methods We performed a systematic review by searching the following online databases: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. The key search terms were ``vagal nerve stimulation,'' ``epilepsy'' and ``heart rate variability''. Other features of VNS in patients with epilepsy include postoperative changes in low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) heart rate variability, which were used as evaluation indices, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and Stata 14.0 statistical software were used for literature quality evaluation and meta-analysis. Results Twelve studies published in English were obtained, and 229 patients with epilepsy who underwent VNS were ultimately included after elimination of duplicate articles and those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Regarding LF heart rate variability, in the response subgroup, patients with DRE with VNS presented a lower value (-0.58) before surgery than after surgery, with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) ranging from −1.00 to −0.15. For HF heart rate variability, patients with DRE with VNS had a lower value (-0.45) before surgery than after surgery in the response subgroup, with a 95\% CI ranging from −0.74 to −0.17. No differences were found for LF/HF values or the LF and HF values of other subgroups. Conclusion VNS has little effect on the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity and would not be expected to cause cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in patients with DRE. For patients with DRE, VNS can control seizures and has little effect on autonomic nervous function.",

abstract = "Patients with uncontrolled epilepsy have a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) is thought to be the determining cause of death in many cases of SUDEP. The goal of the present study was to use Scn1aR1407X/+ (Dravet Syndrome, DS) and DBA/1 mice to determine: (1) the effect of a ketogenic diet (KD) on S-IRA and (2) the relationship between serum ketones and the protective effect of a KD. Ketogenic diet treatment significantly decreased spontaneous seizure-induced mortality in DS mice compared to control (8\% vs 39\%, p = 0.0021). This protective effect was not abolished when ketosis was prevented by supplementing the KD with glucose (10\% mortality, p = 0.0007). In DBA/1 mice, the latency to onset of S-IRA due to audiogenic seizures was delayed from 7.6 to 20.8 seconds by a KD on treatment day (TD) 7 compared to control (p < 0.0001), an effect that was reversed on TD14 when mice were crossed over to a control diet on TD7. $\beta$-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were significantly decreased in DBA/1 mice on a KD supplemented with glucose (p = 0.0038), but the protective effect was maintained. Our findings show that a KD decreases SUDEP in DS mice and increases the latency to audiogenic S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. In both mouse models, a KD was protective against S-IRA. This effect may be due in part to specific dietary components rather than generation of ketone bodies.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Heart rate variability (HRV), an index of the autonomic cardiac activity, is decreased in patients with epilepsy, and a low HRV is associated with a higher risk of sudden death. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are one of the most consistent risk factors for SUDEP, but the influence (and relative risk) of each type of seizure on cardiac function is still unknown. Our objective was to assess the impact of the type of seizure (focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure - FBTCS - versus non-FBTCS) on periictal HRV, in a group of patients with refractory epilepsy and both types of seizures. METHODS: We performed a 48-hour Holter recording on 121 patients consecutively admitted to our Epilepsy Monitoring Unit. We only included patients with both FBTCS and non-FBTCS on the Holter recording and selected the first seizure of each type to analyze. To evaluate HRV parameters (AVNN, SDNN, RMSSD, pNN20, LF, HF, and LF/HF), we chose 5-min epochs pre- and postictally. RESULTS: We included 14 patients, with a median age of 36 (min-max, 16-55) years and 64\% were female. Thirty-six percent had cardiovascular risk factors, but no previously known cardiac disease. In the preictal period, there were no statistically significant differences in HRV parameters, between FBTCS and non-FBTCS. In the postictal period, AVNN, RMSSD, pNN20, LF, and HF were significantly lower, and LF/HF and HR were significantly higher in FBTCS. From preictal to postictal periods, FBTCS elicited a statistically significant rise in HR and LF/HF, and a statistically significant fall in AVNN, RMSSD, pNN20, and HF. Non-FBTCS only caused statistically significant changes in HR (decrease) and AVNN (increase). SIGNIFICANCE/CONCLUSION: This work emphasizes the greater effect of FBTCS in autonomic cardiac function in patients with refractory epilepsy, compared to other types of seizures, with a significant reduction in vagal tonus, which may be associated with an increased risk of SUDEP.",

abstract = "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) remains a leading cause of death in people with epilepsy. Despite the constant risk for patients and bereavement to family members, to date the physiological mechanisms of SUDEP remain unknown. Here we explore the potential to identify putative predictive signals of SUDEP from online digital behavioral data using text and sentiment analysis tools. Specifically, we analyze Facebook timelines of six patients with epilepsy deceased due to SUDEP, donated by surviving family members. We find preliminary evidence for behavioral changes detectable by text and sentiment analysis tools. Namely, in the months preceding their SUDEP event patient social media timelines show: i) increase in verbosity; ii) increased use of functional words; and iii) sentiment shifts as measured by different sentiment analysis tools. Combined, these results suggest that social media engagement, as well as its sentiment, may serve as possible early-warning signals for SUDEP in people with epilepsy. While the small sample of patient timelines analyzed in this study prevents generalization, our preliminary investigation demonstrates the potential of social media data as complementary data in larger studies of SUDEP and epilepsy.",

abstract = "DEPDC5-related epilepsy, caused by pathogenic germline variants(with or without additional somatic variants in the brain) of DEPDC5 (Dishevelled, Egl-10 and Pleckstrin domain-containing protein 5) gene, is a newly discovered predominantly focal epilepsy linked to enhanced mTORC1 pathway. DEPDC5-related epilepsy includes several familial epilepsy syndromes, including familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF) and rare sporadic nonlesional focal epilepsy. DEPDC5 has been identified as one of the more common epilepsy genes linked to infantile spasms and sudden unexpected death (SUDEP). Although intelligence usually is unaffected in DEPDC5-related epilepsy, some people have been diagnosed with intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, and other psychiatric problems. DEPDC5 variants have also been found in 20\% of individuals with various brain abnormalities, challenging the traditional distinction between lesional and nonlesional epilepsies. The most exciting development of DEPDC5 variants is the possibility of precision therapeutics using mTOR inhibitors, as evidenced with phenotypic rescue in many animal models. However, more research is needed to better understand the functional impact of diverse (particularly missense or splice-region) variants, the specific involvement of DEPDC5 in epileptogenesis, and the creation and utilization of precision therapies in humans. Precision treatments for DEPDC5-related epilepsy will benefit not only a small number of people with the condition, but they will also pave the way for new therapeutic approaches in epilepsy (including acquired epilepsies in which mTORC1 activation occurs, for example, post-traumatic epilepsy) and other neurological disorders involving a dysfunctional mTOR pathway.",

abstract = "Objective To investigate carotid body (CB) mechanisms related to sudden death during seizure. Ictal activation of oxygen-conserving reflexes (OCRs) can trigger fatal cardiorespiratory collapse in seizing rats, which presents like human sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The CB is strongly implicated in OCR pathways; we hypothesize that modulating CB activity will provide insight into these mechanisms of death. Methods Long-Evans rats were anesthetized with urethane. Recordings included: electrocorticography, electrocardiography, respiration via nasal thermocouple, and blood pressure (BP). The mammalian diving reflex (MDR) was activated by cold water delivered through a nasal cannula. Reflex and stimulation trials were repeated up to 16 times (4 pre-intervention, 12 post-intervention) or until death. In some animals, one or both carotid bodies were denervated. In some animals, the CB was electrically stimulated, both with and without MDR. Seizures were induced with kainic acid (KA). Results Animals without seizure and with no CB modulation survived all reflexes. Non-seizing animals with CB denervation survived 7.1 $\pm$ 5.4 reflexes before death, and only 1 of 7 survived past the 12-trial threshold. Electrical CB stimulation without seizure and without reflex caused significant tachypnea and hypotension. Electrical CB stimulation with seizure and without reflex required higher amplitudes to replicate the physiological responses seen outside seizure. Seizing animals without CB intervention survived 3.2 $\pm$ 3.6 trials (per-reflex survival rate 42.0\% $\pm$ 44.4\%), and 0 of 7 survived past the 12-trial threshold. Seizing animals with electrical CB stimulation survived 10.5 $\pm$ 4.7 ictal trials (per-reflex survival rate 86.3\% $\pm$ 35.0\%), and 6 of 8 survived past the 12-trial threshold. Significance These results suggest that, during seizure, the ability of the CB to stimulate a restart of respiration is impaired. The CB and its afferents may be relevant to fatal ictal apnea and SUDEP in humans, and CB stimulation may be a relevant intervention technique in these deaths.",

METHOD: A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with an index discharge from the pediatric epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) or general neurology service for functional seizures. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, risk factors, and treatment during the index admission. RESULTS: A total of one hundred and two patients were included, of which nearly one in five had a 30-day readmission or emergency department presentation. Index admission to the general neurology service was independently associated with more re-presentations to the hospital (t = 3.26, p < 0.0015). The univariate analysis indicated that cognitive impairment and autism were associated with a lower likelihood of readmission, while a neurology referral and being started on an anti-seizure medication were associated with a greater likelihood of readmission. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of pediatric patients with FS return to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. Our data suggest that patients admitted to the EMU service have a lower likelihood of readmission. We speculate that this may be due to differences in patient clinical characteristics as well as the comprehensiveness of the diagnostic evaluation and management in the EMU compared to the general neurology service.",

METHODS: Patients with epilepsy and ATE were identified via clinic encounters and consensus epilepsy surgery conference at a Level 4 epilepsy center. The drug-resistant subset of these patients who underwent epilepsy surgery (twenty-two of thirty-five) were compared to age- and laterality-matched patients with MTS. Clinical, neuropsychological, electrophysiologic, and surgical data were abstracted through chart review. RESULTS: In comparison with MTS, ATE patients were more often female, had significantly later onset of epilepsy, and did not have prior febrile seizures. In addition, ATE patients were more likely to have chronic headaches and other historical features consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Failure to identify ATE on initial imaging was common. Most patients had limited temporal cortical resections sparing mesial structures. Of the twenty ATE patients who had a long-term postsurgical follow-up, seventeen (85\%) had International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Class 1 or 2 outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: A shorter duration of epilepsy, female gender, and lack of history of febrile seizures may suggest ATE as an etiology of refractory TLE in adults. Targeted encephalocele resections can result in seizure freedom, underscoring the importance of encephalocele identification.",

abstract = "Purpose To understand the experiences of bereaved relatives of individuals who passed due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and to explore the impacts of death in their lives. Methods The principles of fundamental qualitative description informed all design decisions. Stratified purposeful sampling included 21 bereaved relatives (parent, sibling, or spouse/partner), aged at least 18 years, of persons who passed away because of SUDEP. In-depth one-to-one interviews were conducted. Directed content analysis was used to code, categorize, and synthesize the interview data. Results There was some criticism of emergency response and medical professionals involved in providing insensitive or poor care immediately after SUDEP occurred. Personal hardships described by participants following SUDEP included loss of personal identity, feeling depressed, experiencing guilt, having panic attacks, requiring therapy, as well as having difficulty with anniversaries, dates, and cleaning up a child's room. Bereaved spouses and parents in particular spoke of experiencing challenges in maintaining other relationships following the death. Some participants spoke of experiencing increased financial hardships. Ways of coping included keeping oneself busy, honoring the memory of the loved one, relying on friends and families, and engaging in advocacy/community work, including raising awareness on epilepsy and SUDEP. Conclusions Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy affected several aspects of the day-to-day lives of bereaved relatives. Though methods of coping were similar to the usual strategies adopted by all bereaved relatives, advocacy work related to raising awareness about epilepsy and SUDEP was unique to this group. Guidelines on SUDEP should ideally include recommendations for trauma-informed support and assessment for depression and anxiety to the bereaved relatives as well.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Functional seizures (FS) are paroxysmal episodes, resembling epileptic seizures, but without underlying epileptic abnormality. The aetiology and neuroanatomic associations are incompletely understood. Recent brain imaging data indicate cerebral changes, however, without clarifying possible pathophysiology. In the present study, we specifically investigated the neuroanatomic changes in subregions of the amygdala and hippocampus in FS. METHODS: T1 MRI scans of 37 female patients with FS and 37 age-matched female seizure na{\"\i}ve controls (SNC) were analyzed retrospectively in FreeSurfer version 7.1. Seizure na{\"\i}ve controls included patients with depression and anxiety disorders. The analysis included whole-brain cortical thickness, subcortical volumes, and subfields of the amygdala and hippocampus. Group comparisons were carried out using multivariable linear models. RESULTS: The FS and SNC groups did not differ in the whole hippocampus and amygdala volumes. However, patients had a significant reduction of the right lateral amygdala volume (p = 0.00041), an increase of the right central amygdala, (p = 0.037), and thinning of the left superior frontal gyrus (p = 0.024). Additional findings in patients were increased volumes of the right medial amygdala (p = 0.031), left anterior amygdala (p = 0.017), and left dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The observations from the amygdala and hippocampus segmentation affirm that there are neuroanatomic associations of FS. The pattern of these changes aligned with some of the cerebral changes described in chronic stress conditions and depression. The pattern of detected changes further study, and may, after validation, provide biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",

Beginning with Vale and Colleagues in 1981, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) also called corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) has repeatedly been identified as an important contributor to fear and anxiety behavior. These findings have proven useful to further our understanding of disorders that have significant fear-dysregulation, such as post-traumatic stress, as well as other stress- and anxiety-related disorders. Unfortunately, the data are not all in agreement. In particular the role of CRF in fear learning is controversial, with studies pointing to contradictory effects from CRF manipulation even within the same brain structure. Further, very few studies address the potentially promising role of CRF manipulation in fear extinction behavior. Here, we briefly review the role of CRF in anxiety, fear learning and extinction, focusing on recent cell-type and neurotransmitter-specific studies in the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that may help to synthesize the available data on the role of CRF in fear and anxiety-related behaviors.",

abstract = "It has been shown that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) of rats contains nitrergic neurons, which are activated during animal exposure to aversive stimuli. The BNST is also populated by glutamatergic and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRFergic) neurons, which in turn are activated under stressful situations. Here we investigated the anxiogenic-like effects of intra-BNST injections of a nitric oxide (NO) donor, NOC-9 in mice. The role of CRFergic and glutamatergic systems on defensive behavior induced by NOC-9 was investigated with previous intra-BNST infusion of different doses of CP376395, a CRF type 1 receptor antagonist (CRF1), or AP-7, an NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor antagonist. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed immediately and 5min after intra-BNST drug injection, exposing mice to a novel arena and to the elevated plus-maze (EPM; an anxiogenic situation). Results showed that NOC-9 provoked a short period ($\approx$150s) of freezing behavior in the novel arena and increased anxiety in the EPM. Both CP and AP-7 attenuated the anxiogenic-like effects of NOC-9 in the EPM without changing freezing behavior in the novel arena. When given alone (i.e. without prior intra-BNST injection of NOC-9), AP-7 (0.20nmol), but not CP (0.75, 1.50, or 3.00nmol), attenuated anxiety in mice exposed to the EPM. These results suggest that CRF1 and NMDA receptors located within the BNST differentially modulate aversive effects induced by NO production in this limbic forebrain structure.",

abstract = "While developmental consequences of parental investment on species-typical social behaviors has been extensively characterized in same-sex parent-offspring interactions, the impact of opposite-sex relationships is less clear. In the bi-parental California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), paternal retrieval behavior induces territorial aggression and the expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in adult male offspring. Although similar patterns of territorially emerge among females, the sexually dimorphic AVP system has not been considered since it is generally thought to regulate male-typical behavior. However, we recently demonstrated that male and female P. californicus offspring experience increases in plasma testosterone following paternal retrieval. Since AVP expression is androgen-dependent during development, we postulate that increases in AVP expression may accompany territoriality in female, as well as male offspring. To explore this aim, adult P. californicus offspring that received either high or low levels of paternal care (retrievals) during early development were tested for territoriality and immunohistochemical analysis of AVP within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and supraoptic nucleus (SON). Consistent with previous studies, high care offspring were more aggressive than low care offspring. Moreover, high care offspring had significantly more AVP immunoreactive (AVP-ir) cells within the BNST than low care offspring. This pattern was observed within female as well as male offspring, suggesting an equally salient role for paternal care on female offspring physiology. Regardless of early social experience, sex differences in AVP persisted in the BNST, with males having greater expression than females.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is more prevalent in populations with high measures of stress, but the neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. Stress is a common precipitant of seizures in individuals with epilepsy, and may provoke seizures by several mechanisms including changes in neurotransmitter and hormone levels within the brain. Importantly, stress during sensitive periods early in life contributes to 'brain programming', influencing neuronal function and brain networks. However, it is unclear if early-life stress influences limbic excitability and promotes epilepsy. Here we used an established, naturalistic model of chronic early-life stress (CES), and employed chronic cortical and limbic video-EEGs combined with molecular and cellular techniques to probe the contributions of stress to age-specific epilepsies and network hyperexcitability and identify the underlying mechanisms. In control male rats, EEGs obtained throughout development were normal and no seizures were observed. EEGs demonstrated epileptic spikes and spike series in the majority of rats experiencing CES, and 57\% of CES rats developed seizures: Behavioral events resembling the human age-specific epilepsy infantile spasms occurred in 11/23 (48\%), accompanied by EEG spikes and/or electrodecrements, and two additional rats (9\%) developed limbic seizures that involved the amygdala. Probing for stress-dependent, endogenous convulsant molecules within amygdala, we examined the expression of the pro-convulsant neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and found a significant increase of amygdalar--but not cortical--CRH expression in adolescent CES rats. In conclusion, CES of limited duration has long-lasting effects on brain excitability and may promote age-specific seizures and epilepsy. Whereas the mechanisms involved require further study, these findings provide important insights into environmental contributions to early-life seizures.",

However, the brain networks that mediate stress responses to these stimuli need to be further studied. We used c-Fos mapping in mice to characterize brain circuits activated by exposure to a single episode of multimodal stress (MMS), and compared these to circuits activated by electric foot shocks (EFS). We focused on characterizing c-Fos activity in stress-relevant brain regions including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We also assessed stress-induced activation of CRH-positive neurons in each of these structures. MMS and EFS activated an overlapping network of brain regions with a similar time course. c-Fos expression within the PVN and the BNST peaked 30-60 min after exposure to both MMS and EFS, and returned to baseline levels within 24 h. Quantification of c-Fos expression within BNST subregions revealed that while c-Fos expression peaked in all subregions 30-60 min after MMS and EFS exposure, the neuronal density of c-Fos expression was significantly higher in the dorsomedial and ventral BNST relative to the dorsolateral BNST. Our preliminary assessment indicated that a great majority of MMS or EFS-activated neurons in the PVN were CRH-positive (>87\%); in contrast, about 6-35\% of activated neurons in the BNST were CRH-positive. Our findings indicate that both MMS and EFS are effective at activating stress-relevant brain areas and support the use of MMS as an effective approach for studying multidimensional stress in animal models. The results also reveal that the PVN and BNST are part of a common neural circuit substrate involved in neural processing related to stress.",

abstract = "Studies demonstrate a role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in modulating affective behavior and stress-reward integration. To explore the dynamic nature of in vivo BNST activity associated with anxiety-like behavior in a stress-inducing context, we utilized fiber photometry and detected BNST calcium transients in mice during the novelty-suppressed feeding task (NSFT). Phasic BNST activity emerged time-locked to novel object or food pellet approach during NSFT. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) has a large input to the BNST and is thought to function as a danger signal, in arousal responses and in feeding behavior. To explore a potential role for the PBN as a contributor to BNST activity in NSFT, we investigated whether chemogenetic regulation of PBN activity altered the dynamic BNST response synchronized to NSFT approach behavior. We found that activation of the hM3D(Gq) DREADD in the PBN enhanced the observed transient signal in the BNST synchronized to the consummatory food approach, and was associated at the behavioral level with increased latency to consume food. Because the PBN has multiple efferent pathways, we next used a transsynaptic anterograde AAV-based strategy to express hM3D(Gq) specifically in PBN-innervated BNST (BNSTPBN) neurons in male and female mice. Activation of hM3D(Gq) in these BNSTPBN neurons increased latency to consume food in female, but not male mice. To further explore the population of BNST neurons contributing to phasic BNST activity associated with NSFT, we turned to PKC$\delta$ neurons in BNST. BNST(PKC$\delta$) neurons are implicated in stress and food-related behavior, and we previously found that the expression of this kinase is regulated in the BNST by stress in a sex-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate close apposition of CGRP, a marker of PBN terminals, adjacent to BNST(PKC$\delta$) cells. Finally, we find that PKC$\delta$-expressing BNST cells exhibit a large transient signal synchronized to the consummatory food approach similar to that seen with bulk BNST activity measures. Taken together these data demonstrate phasic BNST activity at a global and cell-specific level that is driven in part by PBN activity at the time of NSFT consummatory approach behavior.",

abstract = "Anxiety and trauma-related disorders are characterized by significant alterations in threat detection, resulting in inadequate fear responses evoked by weak threats or safety stimuli. Recent research pointed out the important role of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) in threat anticipation and fear modulation under ambiguous threats, hence, exaggerated fear may be traced back to altered BNST function. To test this hypothesis, we chemogenetically inhibited specific BNST neuronal populations (corticotropin-releasing hormone - BNSTCRH and somatostatin - BNSTSST expressing neurons) in a predator odor-evoked innate fear paradigm. The rationale for this paradigm was threefold: (1) predatory cues are particularly strong danger signals for all vertebrate species evoking defensive responses on the flight-avoidance-freezing dimension (conservative mechanisms), (2) predator odor can be presented in a scalable manner (from weak to strong), and (3) higher-order processing of olfactory information including predatory odor stimuli is integrated by the BNST. Accordingly, we exposed adult male mice to low and high predatory threats presented by means of cat urine, or low- and high-dose of 2-methyl-2-thiazoline (2MT), a synthetic derivate of a fox anogenital product, which evoked low and high fear response, respectively. Then, we tested the impact of chemogenetic inhibition of BNSTCRH and BNSTSST neurons on innate fear responses using crh- and sst-ires-cre mouse lines. We observed that BNSTSST inhibition was effective only under low threat conditions, resulting in reduced avoidance and increased exploration of the odor source. In contrast, BNSTCRH inhibition had no impact on 2MT-evoked responses, but enhanced fear responses to cat odor, representing an even weaker threat stimulus. These findings support the notion that BNST is recruited by uncertain or remote, potential threats, and CRH and SST neurons orchestrate innate fear responses in complementary ways.",

abstract = "Sclerosis of the amygdala is a not uncommon finding in patients with chronic epilepsy. The amygdala has efferent connections, via the central nuclei, to cardioregulatory centres in the medulla. Experimental studies have suggested that damage to the central nucleus may be of functional significance in patients with sudden and unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in particular with regard to their susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias. We investigated this possibility by carrying out a quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of the patterns of neuronal loss and gliosis in three amygdala subnuclei (central, basal and lateral) in post mortem material from 15 SUDEP cases and seven normal controls. We identified significant neuronal loss in the medial division of the lateral amygdaloid nucleus in SUDEP cases but not in central or basal nuclei. These patterns of cell loss in the amygdala do not differ from previous studies in both humans and animal models of chronic epilepsy suggesting that there is not a specific pattern of amygdaloid sclerosis in SUDEP patients which could implicate a functional role for this nucleus in the mechanism of the sudden death.",

abstract = "Animal evidence has suggested that maternal emotional and nutritional stress during pregnancy is associated with behavioral outcomes in offspring. The nature of the stresses applied may differ, but it is often assumed that the mother's hippocampus--hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal (HHPA) axis response releases higher levels of glucocorticoid hormones. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is in a pivotal position to regulate the HHPA axis and the stress response, and it has been implicated in anxiety behavior. In the current study, to search whether BNST structural changes and neurochemical alterations are associated with anxiety-related behavior in adult gestational protein-restricted offspring relative to an age-matched normal protein diet (NP) rats, we conduct behavioral tests and, BNST dendritic tree analysis by Sholl analysis, associated to immunoblotting--protein quantification [11$\beta$-HSD2, GR, MR, AT1R, 5HT1A and 5HT2A, corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRH) and CRH1]. Dams were maintained either on isocaloric standard rodent chow [with NP content, 17\% casein or low protein content (LP), 6\% casein] chow throughout their entire pregnancy. Here, in rats subjected to gestational protein restriction, we found: (a) a significant reduction in dendritic length and impoverished dendritic arborization in BNST neurons; (b) an elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels; and (c) associated with enhanced anxiety-like behavior when compared with age-matched NP offspring. Moreover, altered protein (11$\beta$-HSD2, GR, MR and type 1 CRH receptors) expressions may underlie the increase in anxiety-like behavior in LP offspring. This work represents the first demonstration that BNST developmental plasticity by maternal protein restriction, resulting in fine structural changes and neurochemical alterations that are associated with modified behavioral states.",

abstract = "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe epilepsy syndrome that starts within the first year of life. In a clinical study, add-on treatment with fenfluramine, a potent 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) releaser activating multiple 5-HT receptor subtypes, made 70\% of DS children seizure free. Others and we recently confirmed the efficacy of fenfluramine as an antiepileptiform compound in zebrafish models of DS. By using a large set of subtype selective agonists, in this study we examined which 5-HT receptor subtypes can be targeted to trigger antiseizure effects in homozygous scn1Lab(-/-) mutant zebrafish larvae that recapitulate DS well. We also provide evidence that zebrafish larvae express the orthologues of all human 5-HT receptor subtypes. Using an automated larval locomotor behavior assay, we were able to show that selective 5-HT1D-, 5-HT1E-, 5-HT2A-, 5-HT2C-, and 5-HT7-agonists significantly decreased epileptiform activity in the mutant zebrafish at 7 days post fertilization (dpf). By measuring local field potentials in the zebrafish larval forebrain, we confirmed the antiepileptiform activity of the 5-HT1D-, 5-HT2C-, and especially the 5-HT2A-agonist. Interestingly, we also found a significant decrease of serotonin in the heads of homozygous scn1Lab(-/-) mutants as compared to the wild type zebrafish, which suggest that neurochemical defects might play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of DS. Taken together, our results emphasize the high conservation of the serotonergic receptors in zebrafish larvae. Modulating certain serotonergic receptors was shown to effectively reduce seizures. Our findings therefore open new avenues for the development of future novel DS therapeutics.",

author = "Harris, Nicholas A and Winder, Danny G",
abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a component of the extended amygdala that shows significant changes in activity and plasticity through chronic exposure to drugs and stress. The region is critical for stress- and cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behaviors and is thus a candidate region for the plastic changes that occur in abstinence that prime addicted patients for reinstatement behaviors. Here, we discuss the various forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the rodent BNST and highlight the way that these changes in excitatory transmission interact with exposure to alcohol and other drugs of abuse, as well as other stressors. In addition, we highlight potential areas for future research in this area, including investigating input- and cell-specific bidirectional changes in activity. As we continue to accrue foundational knowledge in the mechanisms and effects of plasticity in the BNST, molecular targets and treatment strategies that are relevant to reinstatement behaviors will also begin to emerge. Here, we briefly discuss the effects of catecholamine receptor modulators on synaptic plasticity in the BNST due to the role of norepinephrine in LTD and dopamine on the short-term component of LTP as well as the role that signaling at these receptors plays in reinstatement of drug- and alcohol-seeking behaviors. We hope that insights gained on the specific changes in plasticity that occur within the BNST during abstinence from alcohol and other drugs of abuse will provide insight into the biological underpinnings of relapse behavior in human addicts and inform future treatment modalities for addiction that tackle this complex biological problem.",

Here, we use mice expressing channelrhodopsin in norepinephrine neurons to selectively activate terminals in the BNST, and measure norepinephrine release with optogenetics-assisted fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). We demonstrate that while corticosterone habituates to chronic restraint stress, cFos activation of medullary norepinephrine neurons shows equivalent activation under both acute and chronic stress conditions. Mice exposed to a single restraint session show an identical optically stimulated norepinephrine release profile compared to that of unexposed mice. Mice experiencing 5 days of restraint stress, however, show elevated norepinephrine release across multiple stimulation parameters, and reduced sensitivity to the $\alpha$2-adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist idazoxan. These data are the first to examine norepinephrine release in the BNST to tonic and phasic stimulation frequencies, and confirm that repeated stress alters autoreceptor sensitivity.",

These diverse responses are elicited through the activation of a large family of receptor subtypes. The complexity of this signalling system and the paucity of selective drugs have made it difficult to define specific roles for 5-HT receptor subtypes, or to determine how serotonergic drugs modulate mood and behaviour. To address these issues, we have generated mutant mice lacking functional 5-HT2C receptors (previously termed 5-HT1C), prominent G-protein-coupled receptors that are widely expressed throughout the brain and spinal cord and which have been proposed to mediate numerous central nervous system (CNS) actions of serotonin. Here we show that 5-HT2C receptor-deficient mice are overweight as a result of abnormal control of feeding behaviour, establishing a role for this receptor in the serotonergic control of appetite. Mutant animals are also prone to spontaneous death from seizures, suggesting that 5-HT2C receptors mediate tonic inhibition of neuronal network excitability.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a center of integration for limbic information and valence monitoring. The BNST, sometimes referred to as the extended amygdala, is located in the basal forebrain and is a sexually dimorphic structure made up of between 12 and 18 sub-nuclei. These sub-nuclei are rich with distinct neuronal subpopulations of receptors, neurotransmitters, transporters and proteins. The BNST is important in a range of behaviors such as: the stress response, extended duration fear states and social behavior, all crucial determinants of dysfunction in human psychiatric diseases. Most research on stress and psychiatric diseases has focused on the amygdala, which regulates immediate responses to fear. However, the BNST, and not the amygdala, is the center of the psychogenic circuit from the hippocampus to the paraventricular nucleus. This circuit is important in the stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Thus, the BNST has been largely overlooked with respect to its possible dysregulation in mood and anxiety disorders, social dysfunction and psychological trauma, all of which have clear gender disparities. In this review, we will look in-depth at the anatomy and projections of the BNST, and provide an overview of the current literature on the relevance of BNST dysregulation in psychiatric diseases.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 16 February 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.1.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is critical in mediating states of anxiety, and its dysfunction has been linked to stress-related mental disease. Although the anxiety-related role of distinct subregions of the anterior BNST was recently reported, little is known about the contribution of the posterior BNST (pBNST) to the behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress. Previously, we observed abnormal expression of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2 (CRFR2) to be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms. Here, we found that CRFR2-expressing neurons within the pBNST send dense inhibitory projections to other stress-related brain regions (for example, the locus coeruleus, medial amygdala and paraventricular nucleus), implicating a prominent role of these neurons in orchestrating the neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral response to stressful situations. Local CRFR2 activation by urocortin 3 depolarized the cells, increased the neuronal input resistance and increased firing of action potentials, indicating an enhanced excitability. Furthermore, we showed that CRFR2-expressing neurons within the pBNST are critically involved in the modulation of the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to stress. Optogenetic activation of CRFR2 neurons in the pBNST decreased anxiety, attenuated the neuroendocrine stress response, ameliorated stress-induced anxiety and impaired the fear memory for the stressful event. Moreover, activation following trauma exposure reduced the susceptibility for PTSD-like symptoms. Optogenetic inhibition of pBNST CRFR2 neurons yielded opposite effects. These data indicate the relevance of pBNST activity for adaptive stress recovery.",

abstract = "The brain circuits underlying behavioral fear have been extensively studied over the last decades. Although the vast majority of experimental studies assess fear as a transient state of apprehension in response to a discrete threat, such phasic states of fear can shift to a sustained anxious apprehension, particularly in face of diffuse cues with unpredictable environmental contingencies. Unpredictability, in turn, is considered an important variable contributing to anxiety disorders. The networks of the extended amygdala have been suggested keys to the control of phasic and sustained states of fear, although the underlying synaptic pathways and mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the endocannabinoid system acting in synaptic circuits of the extended amygdala can explain the fear response profile during exposure to unpredictable threat. Using fear training with predictable or unpredictable cues in mice, combined with local and cell-type-specific deficiency and rescue of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors, we found that presynaptic CB1 receptors on distinct amygdala projections to bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are both necessary and sufficient for the shift from phasic to sustained fear in response to an unpredictable threat. These results thereby identify the causal role of a defined protein in a distinct brain pathway for the temporal development of a sustained state of anxious apprehension during unpredictability of environmental influences, reminiscent of anxiety symptoms in humans.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 4 October 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.156.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a brain region important for regulating anxiety-related behavior in both humans and rodents. Here we used a chemogenetic strategy to investigate how engagement of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades in genetically defined GABAergic BNST neurons modulates anxiety-related behavior and downstream circuit function. We saw that stimulation of vesicular $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (VGAT)-expressing BNST neurons using hM3Dq, but neither hM4Di nor rM3Ds designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD), promotes anxiety-like behavior. Further, we identified that activation of hM3Dq receptors in BNST VGAT neurons can induce a long-term depression-like state of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, indicating DREADD-induced changes in synaptic plasticity. Further, we used DREADD-assisted metabolic mapping to profile brain-wide network activity following activation of Gq-mediated signaling in BNST VGAT neurons and saw increased activity within ventral midbrain structures, including the ventral tegmental area and hindbrain structures such as the locus coeruleus and parabrachial nucleus. These results highlight that Gq-mediated signaling in BNST VGAT neurons can drive downstream network activity that correlates with anxiety-like behavior and points to the importance of identifying endogenous GPCRs within genetically defined cell populations. We next used a microfluidics approach to profile the receptorome of single BNST VGAT neurons. This approach yielded multiple Gq-coupled receptors that are associated with anxiety-like behavior and several potential novel candidates for regulation of anxiety-like behavior. From this, we identified that stimulation of the Gq-coupled receptor 5-HT2CR in the BNST is sufficient to elevate anxiety-like behavior in an acoustic startle task. Together, these results provide a novel profile of receptors within genetically defined BNST VGAT neurons that may serve as therapeutic targets for regulating anxiety states and provide a blueprint for examining how G-protein-mediated signaling in a genetically defined cell type can be used to assess behavior and brain-wide circuit function.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 13 December 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.218.",

Here, we study 5-HT inputs into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a major subdivision of the extended amygdala that has been proposed to regulate responses to anxiogenic environments in humans and rodents. While the dorsal part of the BNST (dBNST) receives dense 5-HT innervation, whether and how 5-HT in the dBNST normally modulates anxiety remains unclear. Using optogenetics, we demonstrate that activation of 5-HT terminals in the dBNST reduces anxiety in a highly anxiogenic environment. Further analysis revealed that optogenetic inhibition of 5-HT inputs into the dBNST increases anxiety in a less anxiogenic environment. We found that 5-HT predominantly hyperpolarizes dBNST neurons, reducing their activity in a manner that can be blocked by a 5-HT1A antagonist. Finally, we demonstrate that activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the dBNST is necessary for the anxiolytic effect observed following optogenetic stimulation of 5-HT inputs into the dBNST. These data reveal that 5-HT release in the dBNST modulates anxiety-like behavior via 5-HT1A receptors under naturalistic conditions.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 1 August 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.165.",

Here we show that 5-HT from the dorsal raphe nucleus (5-HT(DRN)) enhances fear and anxiety and activates a subpopulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (CRF(BNST)) in mice. Specifically, 5-HT(DRN) projections to the BNST, via actions at 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT2CRs), engage a CRF(BNST) inhibitory microcircuit that silences anxiolytic BNST outputs to the ventral tegmental area and lateral hypothalamus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this CRF(BNST) inhibitory circuit underlies aversive behaviour following acute exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This early aversive effect is mediated via the corticotrophin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1R, also known as CRHR1), given that CRF1R antagonism is sufficient to prevent acute SSRI-induced enhancements in aversive learning. These results reveal an essential 5-HT(DRN)$\rightarrow$CRF(BNST) circuit governing fear and anxiety, and provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the clinical observation of early adverse events to SSRI treatment in some patients with anxiety disorders.",

abstract = "Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) integrates nutrient signals to control cell growth and organismal homeostasis across eukaryotes. The evolutionarily conserved GATOR complex regulates mTORC1 signalling through Rag GTPases, and GATOR1 displays GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity for RAGA and RAGB (RAGA/B) and GATOR2 has been proposed to be an inhibitor of GATOR1. Furthermore, the metazoan-specific SESN proteins function as guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) for RAGA/B, and interact with GATOR2 with unknown effects. Here we show that SZT2 (seizure threshold 2), a metazoan-specific protein mutated in epilepsy, recruits a fraction of mammalian GATOR1 and GATOR2 to form a SZT2-orchestrated GATOR (SOG) complex with an essential role in GATOR- and SESN-dependent nutrient sensing and mTORC1 regulation. The interaction of SZT2 with GATOR1 and GATOR2 was synergistic, and an intact SOG complex was required for its localization at the lysosome. SZT2 deficiency resulted in constitutive mTORC1 signalling in cells under nutrient-deprived conditions and neonatal lethality in mice, which was associated with failure to inactivate mTORC1 during fasting. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 in SZT2-deficient cells could be partially corrected by overexpression of the GATOR1 component DEPDC5, and by the lysosome-targeted GATOR2 component WDR59 or lysosome-targeted SESN2. These findings demonstrate that SZT2 has a central role in dictating GATOR-dependent nutrient sensing by promoting lysosomal localization of SOG, and reveal an unexpected function of lysosome-located GATOR2 in suppressing mTORC1 signalling through SESN recruitment.",

abstract = "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth that responds to diverse environmental signals and is deregulated in many human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy. Amino acids are a key input to this system, and act through the Rag GTPases to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Multiple protein complexes regulate the Rag GTPases in response to amino acids, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein for RAGA, and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Here we identify a protein complex (KICSTOR) that is composed of four proteins, KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66 and SZT2, and that is required for amino acid or glucose deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 in cultured human cells. In mice that lack SZT2, mTORC1 signalling is increased in several tissues, including in neurons in the brain. KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes; binds and recruits GATOR1, but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for the interaction of GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2. Notably, several KICSTOR components are mutated in neurological diseases associated with mutations that lead to hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Thus, KICSTOR is a lysosome-associated negative regulator of mTORC1 signalling, which, like GATOR1, is mutated in human disease.",

We report high gamma (70-180 Hz) activation for fearful faces with earlier stimulus evoked onset in the amygdala compared with the hippocampus. Attending to fearful faces compared with neutral landscape stimuli enhances low-frequency coupling between the amygdala and the hippocampus. The interaction between the amygdala and hippocampus is largely unidirectional, with theta/alpha oscillations in the amygdala modulating hippocampal gamma activity. Granger prediction, phase slope index and phase lag analysis corroborate this directional coupling.

abstract = "The calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k is critical for hippocampal function and cognition, but its expression is markedly decreased in various neurological disorders associated with epileptiform activity and seizures. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy, both of which are accompanied by recurrent seizures, the severity of cognitive deficits reflects the degree of calbindin reduction in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). However, despite the importance of calbindin in both neuronal physiology and pathology, the regulatory mechanisms that control its expression in the hippocampus are poorly understood. Here we report an epigenetic mechanism through which seizures chronically suppress hippocampal calbindin expression and impair cognition. We demonstrate that $\Delta$FosB, a highly stable transcription factor, is induced in the hippocampus in mouse models of AD and seizures, in which it binds and triggers histone deacetylation at the promoter of the calbindin gene (Calb1) and downregulates Calb1 transcription. Notably, increasing DG calbindin levels, either by direct virus-mediated expression or inhibition of $\Delta$FosB signaling, improves spatial memory in a mouse model of AD. Moreover, levels of $\Delta$FosB and calbindin expression are inversely related in the DG of individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or AD and correlate with performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We propose that chronic suppression of calbindin by $\Delta$FosB is one mechanism through which intermittent seizures drive persistent cognitive deficits in conditions accompanied by recurrent seizures.",

Recent progress in the field has outlined two concepts regarding mechanisms of seizure generation, or ictogenesis. First, all seizures, even those associated with what have historically been thought of as 'primary generalized' epilepsies, appear to originate in local microcircuits and then propagate from that initial ictogenic zone. Second, seizures propagate through cerebral networks and engage microcircuits in distal nodes, a process that can be weakened or even interrupted by suppressing activity in such nodes. We describe various microcircuit motifs, with a special emphasis on one that has been broadly implicated in several epilepsies: feed-forward inhibition. Furthermore, we discuss how, in the dynamic network in which seizures propagate, focusing on circuit 'choke points' remote from the initiation site might be as important as that of the initial dysfunction, the seizure 'focus'.",

It is thought to do so by hijacking brain systems that regulate stress and reward, including neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). The central actions of NPY and CRF have opposing functions in the regulation of emotional and reward-seeking behaviors; thus, dysfunctional interactions between these peptidergic systems could be involved in the development of these pathologies. We used converging physiological, pharmacological and chemogenetic approaches to identify a precise neural mechanism in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a limbic brain region involved in pathological reward and anxiety behaviors, underlying the interactions between NPY and CRF in the regulation of binge alcohol drinking in both mice and monkeys. We found that NPY Y1 receptor (Y1R) activation in the BNST suppressed binge alcohol drinking by enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission specifically in CRF neurons via a previously unknown Gi-mediated, PKA-dependent postsynaptic mechanism. Furthermore, chronic alcohol drinking led to persistent alterations in Y1R function in the BNST of both mice and monkeys, highlighting the enduring, conserved nature of this effect across mammalian species. Together, these data provide both a cellular locus and signaling framework for the development of new therapeutics for treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, including alcohol use disorders.",

Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are critically important for driving feeding and project axons to brain regions implicated in aggression and fear. Using circuit-mapping techniques in mice, we define a disynaptic network originating from a subset of AgRP neurons that project to the medial nucleus of the amygdala and then to the principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which suppresses territorial aggression and reduces contextual fear.

We report here that, in hippocampal slices, selective antagonists of GLU(K5)-containing kainate receptors prevented development of epileptiform activity--evoked by the muscarinic agonist, pilocarpine--and inhibited the activity when it was pre-established. In conscious rats, these GLU(K5) antagonists prevented and interrupted limbic seizures induced by intra-hippocampal pilocarpine perfusion, and attenuated accompanying rises in extracellular L-glutamate and GABA. This anticonvulsant activity occurred without overt side effects. GLU(K5) antagonism also prevented epileptiform activity induced by electrical stimulation, both in vitro and in vivo.

abstract = "Depression is a common comorbidity of temporal lobe epilepsy and has highly negative impact on patients' quality of life. We previously established that pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in rats, concurrently with chronic epilepsy leads to depressive impairments, and that the latter may stem from the dysregulation of hypothalamo--pituitary--adrenocortical (HPA) axis and/or diminished raphe--hippocampal serotonergic transmission. We examined possible involvement of presynaptic and postsynaptic serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in epilepsy-associated depression. Based on their performance in the forced swim test (FST), post-SE animals were classified as those with moderate and severe depressive impairments. In moderately impaired rats, the activity of the HPA axis (examined using plasma corticosterone radioimmunoassay) was higher than in naive subjects, but the functional capacity of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors (measured in raphe using autoradiography) remained unaltered. In severely depressed animals, both the activity of the HPA axis and the function of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors were increased as compared with naive and moderately depressed rats. Pharmacological uncoupling of the HPA axis from raphe nucleus exerted antidepressant effects in severely impaired rats, but did not modify behavior in both naive and moderately depressed animals. Further, the function of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors was diminished in the hippocampus of post-SE rats. Pharmacological activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors improved depressive deficits in epileptic animals. We suggest that under the conditions of chronic epilepsy, excessively hyperactive HPA axis activates presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, thus shifting the regulation of serotonin release in favor of autoinhibition. Downregulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors may further exacerbate the severity of epilepsy-associated depression.",

abstract = "Although a strong co-morbidity exists clinically between epilepsy and depression, the cause of this co-morbidity remains unknown, and a valid animal model is crucial for the identification of underlying mechanisms and the development of a screening tool for novel therapies. Although some rodent models of epilepsy have been reported to display behaviors relevant to affective disorders, the seizure susceptibility of animals prone to depression-like behavior has not been characterized. Toward this end, we assessed several forms of seizure sensitivity and epileptogenesis in rats selectively bred for vulnerability (Swim Lo-Active; SwLo) or resilience (Swim High-Active; SwHi) to depression-like phenotypes. The SwLo rats exhibit decreased motor activity in a swim test and other depression-like phenotypes, whereas the SwHi rats display increased motor activity in a swim test. SwLo rats exhibited a decreased latency to limbic motor seizures following acute pilocarpine administration in the absence of differences in pilocarpine pharmacokinetics, and also had a decreased threshold to tonic seizures induced by electroshock. Approximately half of the SwLo rats, but none of the SwHi rats, had spontaneous limbic motor seizures 5 weeks following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. While the number of stimulations required to achieve full amygdala and hippocampal electrical kindling were similar in the two rat lines, SwLo rats had a lower final hippocampal kindling threshold and more wet dog shakes during both amygdala and hippocampal kindling. Combined, these results indicate that SwLo rats are a model of epilepsy and depression co-morbidity that can be used for investigating underlying neurobiological and genetic mechanisms and screening novel therapeutics.",

Although CRF is known to activate two receptor subtypes, CRF1 and CRF2, attempts to delineate the specific role of each subtype in modulating anxiety and nociception have been inconsistent. Here we test the hypothesis that CRF1 and CRF2 receptor activation in the anteriolateral BNST (BNSTAL) facilitates divergent mechanisms modulating comorbid anxiety and hyperalgesia. Microinfusions of the specific antagonists CP376395 and Astressin2B into the BNSTAL were used to investigate CRF1 and CRF2 receptor functions, respectively. We found that CRF1 and CRF2 receptors in the BNSTAL had opposing effects on exploratory behavior in the elevated plus-maze, somatic mechanical threshold, and the autonomic and endocrine response to stress. However, CRF1 or CRF2 receptor antagonism in the BNSTAL revealed complementary roles in facilitating the acoustic startle and visceromotor reflexes. Our results suggest that the net effect of CRF1 and CRF2 receptor activation in the BNSTAL is pathway-dependent and provides important insight into the CRF receptor-associated circuitry that likely underpins stress-induced pathologies.",

As one of the most complex structures in the central nervous system, the intrinsic circuitry of the BNST is largely unknown; however, recent technological developments have allowed researchers to begin to untangle the internal connections of the nucleus. This research has revealed the possibility of two opposing circuits, one anxiolytic and one anxiogenic, within the BNST, the relative strength of which determines the behavioral outcome. The balance of these pathways is critical in maintaining a normal physiological and behavioral state; however, stress and drugs of abuse can differentially affect the opposing circuitry within the nucleus to shift the balance to a pathological state. In this review, we will examine how stress interacts with the neuromodulators, corticotropin-releasing factor, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin to affect the circuitry of the BNST as well as how synaptic plasticity in the BNST is modulated by stress, resulting in long-lasting changes in the circuit and behavioral state.",

author = "Chen, Yuncai and Baram, Tallie Z",
abstract = "Vulnerability to emotional disorders including depression derives from interactions between genes and environment, especially during sensitive developmental periods. Adverse early-life experiences provoke the release and modify the expression of several stress mediators and neurotransmitters within specific brain regions. The interaction of these mediators with developing neurons and neuronal networks may lead to long-lasting structural and functional alterations associated with cognitive and emotional consequences. Although a vast body of work has linked quantitative and qualitative aspects of stress to adolescent and adult outcomes, a number of questions are unclear. What distinguishes 'normal' from pathologic or toxic stress? How are the effects of stress transformed into structural and functional changes in individual neurons and neuronal networks? Which ones are affected? We review these questions in the context of established and emerging studies. We introduce a novel concept regarding the origin of toxic early-life stress, stating that it may derive from specific patterns of environmental signals, especially those derived from the mother or caretaker. Fragmented and unpredictable patterns of maternal care behaviors induce a profound chronic stress. The aberrant patterns and rhythms of early-life sensory input might also directly and adversely influence the maturation of cognitive and emotional brain circuits, in analogy to visual and auditory brain systems. Thus, unpredictable, stress-provoking early-life experiences may influence adolescent cognitive and emotional outcomes by disrupting the maturation of the underlying brain networks. Comprehensive approaches and multiple levels of analysis are required to probe the protean consequences of early-life adversity on the developing brain. These involve integrated human and animal-model studies, and approaches ranging from in vivo imaging to novel neuroanatomical, molecular, epigenomic, and computational methodologies. Because early-life adversity is a powerful determinant of subsequent vulnerabilities to emotional and cognitive pathologies, understanding the underlying processes will have profound implications for the world's current and future children.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 29 July 2015; doi:10.1038/npp.2015.181.",

abstract = "The consequences of chronic stress on brain structure and function are far reaching. Whereas stress can produce short-term adaptive changes in the brain, chronic stress leads to long-term maladaptive changes that increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and addiction. These two disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United States, and are typically chronic, disabling, and highly comorbid. Emerging evidence implicates a tiny brain region-the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)-in the body's stress response and in anxiety and addiction. Rodent studies provide compelling evidence that the BNST plays a central role in sustained threat monitoring, a form of adaptive anxiety, and in the withdrawal and relapse stages of addiction; however, little is known about the role of BNST in humans. Here, we review current evidence for BNST function in humans, including evidence for a role in the production of both adaptive and maladaptive anxiety. We also review preliminary evidence of the role of BNST in addiction in humans. Together, these studies provide a foundation of knowledge about the role of BNST in adaptive anxiety and stress-related disorders. Although the field is in its infancy, future investigations of human BNST function have tremendous potential to illuminate mechanisms underlying stress-related disorders and identify novel neural targets for treatment.",

Anxiety and numerous psychological disorders are comorbid with substance abuse, and noradrenergic signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is thought to be a source of this convergence. Here, we examined the effects of different stressors on behavior and norepinephrine dynamics in the BNST of rat strains known to differ in their HPA-axis function. We compared the effects of acute morphine dependence and social isolation in non-anxious Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, and a depression model, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. We found a shared phenotype in drug-dependent and singly housed SD rats, characterized by slowed norepinephrine clearance, decreased autoreceptor function, and elevated anxiety. WKY rats exhibited changes in anxiety and autoreceptor function only following morphine dependence. To ascertain the influence of LC inhibition on this plasticity, we administered the LC-terminal-selective toxin DSP-4 to SD and WKY rats. DSP-4-treated SD rats demonstrated a dependence-like phenotype, whereas WKY rats were unchanged. Overall, our findings suggest that individuals with varying stress susceptibilities have different noradrenergic signaling changes in response to stress. These changes may establish conditions that favor stress-induced reinstatement and increase the risk for addiction.",

abstract = "Chronic stress is a major cause of anxiety disorders that can be reliably modeled preclinically, providing insight into alternative therapeutic targets for this mental health illness. Neuropeptides have been targeted in the past to no avail possibly due to our lack of understanding of their role in pathological models. In this study we use a rat model of chronic stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors and hypothesized that neuropeptidergic modulation of synaptic transmission would be altered in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a brain region suspected to contribute to anxiety disorders. We use brain slice neurophysiology and behavioral pharmacology to compare the role of locally released endogenous neuropeptides on synaptic transmission in the oval (ov) BNST of non-stressed (NS) or chronic unpredictably stressed (CUS) rats. We found that in NS rats, post-synaptic depolarization induced the release of vesicular neurotensin (NT) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) that co-acted to increase ovBNST inhibitory synaptic transmission in 59\% of recorded neurons. CUS bolstered this potentiation (100\% of recorded neurons) through an enhanced contribution of NT over CRF. In contrast, locally released opioid neuropeptides decreased ovBNST excitatory synaptic transmission in all recorded neurons, regardless of stress. Consistent with CUS-induced enhanced modulatory effects of NT, blockade of ovBNST NT receptors completely abolished stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze paradigm. The role of NT has been largely unexplored in stress and our findings highlight its potential contribution to an important behavioral consequence of chronic stress, that is, exaggerated avoidance of open space in rats.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 16 August 2017; doi:10.1038/npp.2017.134.",

abstract = "Stressors often contribute to difficulties in maintaining behavior change following a period of abstinence, and may play a significant role in drug relapse. The activation of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) systems in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediates many consequences of chronic stressor exposure. Here we ask whether PACAP is also involved in producing reinstatement in a model of stress-induced relapse to drug taking. Rats self-administered cocaine for 1 h daily over 10 days that was followed by 20 days of extinction training in which lever pressing no longer produced cocaine. In experiment 1, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed at several stages to determine transcript levels of PACAP and corresponding receptors. Reinstatement of cocaine seeking was then tested after footshock exposure in different groups of rats that were pretreated with vehicle solution, a PAC1 receptor antagonist (experiment 2), or a PACAP agonist (experiment 3) without footshock. In experiment 1, cocaine self-administration increased BNST PACAP transcript levels similar to what we have previously reported with chronic stress. In experiment 2, intra-BNST infusions of the PAC1/VPAC2 antagonist, PACAP 6-38, prevented footshock-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine seeking. In experiment 3, intra-BNST PACAP infusion reinstated previously extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior in the absence of footshock. Cocaine self-administration elevated BNST PACAP, and BNST PACAP receptor activation was necessary and sufficient for stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These data suggest that BNST PACAP systems may be viable targets for relapse prevention.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 26 July 2017; doi:10.1038/npp.2017.135.",

abstract = "Chronic or repeated exposure to stressful stimuli can result in several maladaptive consequences, including increased anxiety-like behaviors and altered peptide expression in anxiety-related brain structures. Among these structures, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has been implicated in emotional behaviors as well as regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. In male rodents, chronic variate stress (CVS) has been shown to increase BNST pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and its cognate PAC1 receptor transcript, and BNST PACAP signaling may mediate the maladaptive changes associated with chronic stress. Here, we examined whether CVS would sensitize the behavioral and/or endocrine response to a subthreshold BNST PACAP infusion. Male and cycling female rats were exposed to a 7 day CVS paradigm previously shown to upregulate BNST PAC1 receptor transcripts; control rats were not stressed. Twenty-four hours following the last stressor, rats were bilaterally infused into the BNST with a normally subthreshold dose of PACAP. We found an increase in startle amplitude and plasma corticosterone levels 30 min following intra-BNST PACAP infusion in male rats that had been previously exposed to CVS. CVS did not enhance the startle response in cycling females. Equimolar infusion of the VPAC1/2 receptor ligand vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) had no effect on plasma corticosterone levels even in previously stressed male rats. These results suggest that repeated exposure to stressors may differentially alter the neural circuits underlying the responses to intra-BNST PACAP, and may result in different anxiety-like responses in males and females.",

The main risk factors for SUDEP are associated with poorly controlled seizures, suggesting that most cases of SUDEP are seizure-related events. Dysregulation in cardiac and respiratory physiology, dysfunction in systemic and cerebral circulation physiology, and seizure-induced hormonal and metabolic changes might all contribute to SUDEP. Cardiac factors include bradyarrhythmias and asystole, as well as tachyarrhythmias and alterations to cardiac repolarization. Altered electrolytes and blood pH, as well as the release of catecholamines, modulate cardiac excitability and might facilitate arrhythmias. Respiratory symptoms are not uncommon during seizures and comprise central apnea or bradypnea, and, less frequently, obstruction of the airways and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Alterations to autonomic function, such as a reduction in heart rate variability or disturbed baroreflex sensitivity, can impair the body's capacity to cope with challenging situations of elevated stress, such as seizures. Here, we summarize data on the incidence of and risk factors for SUDEP, and consider the pathophysiological aspects of chronic epilepsy that might lead to sudden death.

Seizure incidence during the human lifespan is at its highest in infancy and childhood. Animal models of epilepsy and human tissue studies suggest that epileptogenesis involves a cascade of molecular, cellular and neuronal network alterations. Within minutes to days following the initial insult, there are acute early changes in neuronal networks, which include rapid alterations to ion channel kinetics as a result of membrane depolarization, post-translational modifications to existing functional proteins, and activation of immediate early genes. Subacute changes occur over hours to weeks, and include transcriptional events, neuronal death and activation of inflammatory cascades. The chronic changes that follow over weeks to months include anatomical changes, such as neurogenesis, mossy fiber sprouting, network reorganization, and gliosis. These epileptogenic processes are developmentally regulated and might contribute to differences in epileptogenesis between adult and developing brains. Here we review the factors responsible for enhanced seizure susceptibility in the developing brain, and consider age-specific mechanisms of epileptogenesis. An understanding of these factors could yield potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of epileptogenesis and also provide biomarkers for identifying patients at risk of developing epilepsy or for monitoring disease progression.",

The aetiology of epilepsy was formerly regarded as unknown in about three-quarters of patients; however, massively parallel gene-sequencing studies, conducted in a framework of international collaboration, have yielded a bounty of discoveries that highlight the importance of gene mutations in the aetiology of epilepsy. These data, coupled with clinical genetic studies, suggest a new paradigm for use in the clinic: many forms of epilepsy are likely to have a genetic basis. Enquiry about a genetic cause of epilepsy is readily overlooked in the clinic for a number of understandable but remediable reasons, not least an incomplete understanding of its genetic architecture. In addition, the importance of de novo mutagenesis is often underappreciated, particularly in the epileptic encephalopathies. Other genomic surprises are worth emphasizing, such as the emerging evidence of a genetic contribution to focal epilepsies-long regarded as acquired conditions-and the complex role of copy number variation. The importance of improved understanding of the genetics of the epilepsies is confirmed by the positive outcomes, in terms of treatment selection and counselling, of receiving a genetic diagnosis.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy, with an estimated 35\% lifetime risk in this patient population. There is a surprising lack of awareness among patients and physicians of this increased risk of sudden death: in a recent survey, only 33\% of Canadian paediatricians who treated patients with epilepsy knew the term SUDEP. Controversy prevails over whether cardiac arrhythmia or respiratory arrest is more important as the primary cause of death. Effective preventive strategies in high-risk patients will rely on definition of the mechanisms that lead from seizures to death. Here, we summarize evidence for the mechanisms that cause cardiac, respiratory and arousal abnormalities during the ictal and postictal period. We highlight potential cellular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities, such as a defect in the serotonergic system, ictal adenosine release, and changes in autonomic output. We discuss genetic mutations that cause Dravet and long QT syndromes, both of which are linked with increased risk of sudden death. We then highlight possible preventive interventions that are likely to decrease SUDEP incidence, including respiratory monitoring in epilepsy monitoring units and overnight supervision. Finally, we discuss treatments, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, that might be personalized to a specific genetic or pathological defect.",

Psychiatric and neurological comorbidities are relatively common and often co-exist in people with epilepsy (PWE). For example, depression and anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric comorbidities in PWE, and they are particularly common in PWE who also have a neurological comorbidity, such as migraine, stroke, traumatic brain injury or dementia. Moreover, psychiatric and neurological comorbodities often have a more severe impact on the quality of life in patients with treatment-resistant focal epilepsy than do the actual seizures. Epilepsy and psychiatric and neurological comorbidities have a complex relationship, which has a direct bearing on the management of both seizures and the comorbidities: the comorbidities have to be factored into the selection of antiepileptic drugs, and the susceptibility to seizures has to be considered when choosing the drugs to treat comorbidities. The aim of this Review is to highlight the complex relationship between epilepsy and common psychiatric and neurological comorbidities, and provide an overview of how treatment strategies for epilepsy can positively and negatively affect these comorbidities and vice versa.",

title = "Seizures and gliomas--towards a single therapeutic approach",
author = "Huberfeld, Gilles and Vecht, Charles J",
abstract = "Epilepsy often develops in patients with glioma, and the two conditions share common pathogenic mechanisms. Altered expression of glutamate transporters, including the cystine-glutamate transporter (xCT) system, increases concentrations of extracellular glutamate, which contribute to epileptic discharge, tumour proliferation and peripheral excitotoxicity. Furthermore, mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene in low-grade gliomas causes production of D-2-hydroxyglutarate, a steric analogue of glutamate. Dysregulation of intracellular chloride promotes glioma cell mitosis and migration, and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signalling suppresses proliferation. In neurons, however, chloride accumulation leads to aberrant depolarization on GABA receptor activation, thereby promoting epileptic activity. The molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and epigenetic abnormalities are also involved in the development of tumours and seizures. Antitumour therapy can contribute to seizure control, and antiepileptic drugs might have beneficial effects on tumours. Symptomatic treatment with antiepileptic drugs carries risks of adverse effects and drug interactions. In this Review, we discuss the potential for single therapeutic agents, such as the xCT blocker sulfasalazine, the chloride regulator bumetanide, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid, to manage both gliomas and associated epilepsy. We also provide guidance on the evidence-based use of antiepileptic drugs in brain tumours. The development of solo therapies to treat both aspects of gliomas promises to yield more-effective treatment with fewer risks of toxicity and drug interactions.",

Alterations in the dual contributions of mTOR - regulation of cell growth and proliferation, as well as autophagy and cell death - have been found in developmental brain malformations, epilepsy, autism and intellectual disability, hypoxic-ischaemic and traumatic brain injuries, brain tumours, and neurodegenerative disorders. mTOR integrates a variety of cues, such as growth factor levels, oxygen levels, and nutrient and energy availability, to regulate protein synthesis and cell growth. In line with the positioning of mTOR as a pivotal cell signalling node, altered mTOR activation has been associated with a group of phenotypically diverse neurological disorders. To understand how altered mTOR signalling leads to such divergent phenotypes, we need insight into the differential effects of enhanced or diminished mTOR activation, the developmental context of these changes, and the cell type affected by altered signalling. A particularly exciting feature of the tale of mTOR discovery is that pharmacological mTOR inhibitors have shown clinical benefits in some neurological disorders, such as tuberous sclerosis complex, and are being considered for clinical trials in epilepsy, autism, dementia, traumatic brain injury, and stroke.",

abstract = "The prevailing view is that parvalbumin (PV) interneurons play modulatory roles in emotional response through local medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). Here, we show that PV activity within the nucleus accumbens shell (sNAc) is required for producing anxiety-like avoidance when mice are under anxiogenic situations. Firing rates of sNAcPV neurons were negatively correlated to exploration time in open arms (threatening environment). In addition, sNAcPV neurons exhibited high excitability in a chronic stress mouse model, which generated excessive maladaptive avoidance behavior in an anxiogenic context. We also discovered a novel GABAergic pathway from the anterior dorsal bed nuclei of stria terminalis (adBNST) to sNAcPV neurons. Optogenetic activation of these afferent terminals in sNAc produced an anxiolytic effect via GABA transmission. Next, we further demonstrated that chronic stressors attenuated the inhibitory synaptic transmission at adBNSTGABA $\rightarrow$ sNAcPV synapses, which in turn explains the hyperexcitability of sNAc PV neurons on stressed models. Therefore, activation of these GABAergic afferents in sNAc rescued the excessive avoidance behavior related to an anxious state. Finally, we identified that the majority GABAergic input neurons, which innervate sNAcPV cells, were expressing somatostatin (SOM), and also revealed that coordination between SOM- and PV- cells functioning in the BNST $\rightarrow$ NAc circuit has an inhibitory influence on anxiety-like responses. Our findings provide a potentially neurobiological basis for therapeutic interventions in pathological anxiety.",

abstract = "Return of previously extinguished fear memories presents a major hurdle in treatment of fear-related disorders. Neuropeptide Y receptors type 2 (Y2R) in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) seem to play a crucial role in modulation of remote fear memories. Here, we targeted Cre-channelrhodopsin-2 to defined subregions of BNST or central amygdala (CeA) in floxed Y2R mice (Y2lox/lox) for functional deletion of Y2R. We combined fear training and behavioral studies in vivo with optogenetic-electrophysiological analysis of BNST synaptic network activity ex vivo, in order to identify regional and cellular specificities of Y2R influence. Deletion of Y2R in the ventral section of anterior BNST (BNSTav) did not affect fear acquisition, but increased conditioned fear during recall and extinction learning, and aggravated remote fear return. By contrast, deletion of Y2R in the dorsal section of anterior BNST (BNSTad) or CeA did not influence acquisition, extinction or return of fear memories. Ex vivo optogenetic-electrophysiological analysis revealed Y2R-expressing local GABAergic inhibitory networks in BNST, both within (intraregional) and in-between (inter-regional) BNST subregions. Stimulation of Y2R resulted in a presynaptically mediated reduction of GABAergic responses, which did not differ between intraregional but predominantly affected inter-regional connections from BNSTav to BNSTad. Moreover, deletion of Y2R decreased the excitation/inhibition balance in BNSTav neurons, suggesting a regulatory influence of endogenous NPY via intraregional GABAergic microcircuits. This study reveals Y2R within local GABAergic networks in BNST as key elements in facilitating extinction and reducing return of remote fear memories, suggesting a potential avenue for translational purposes.",

author = "Gungor, Nur Zeynep and Yamamoto, Ryo and Pare, Denis",
abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) regulates defensive responses to threats and its anteroventral portion (BNST-AV) is involved. BNST-AV contains a minority of glutamatergic neurons scattered among a dominant population of GABAergic cells. There is evidence that these two cell types might exert opposite influences, the former promoting and the latter reducing anxiety. Although GABAergic cells greatly outnumber glutamatergic neurons in BNST-AV, in some circumstances the influence of glutamatergic cells appears to predominate. Related to this, BNST-AV receives a very strong noradrenaline (NA) input and negative emotional states are associated with a marked rise of NA concentration in BNST-AV. However, it is currently unclear whether NA differentially alters the excitability of glutamatergic and GABAergic BNST-AV neurons. Thus, to shed light on how BNST-AV regulates negative emotional states, the present study compared the physiological properties and NA responsiveness of glutamatergic and GABAergic BNST-AV neurons using whole-cell recordings in transgenic mice that express a fluorescent reporter in either cell group. We found that glutamatergic cells had a slightly more complex morphology than the GABAergic cells, a higher intrinsic excitability, and a different responsiveness to NA. Indeed, while NA inhibited EPSPs in both cell types through $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$2 adrenoreceptors, the EPSP reduction seen in glutamatergic cells had a lower amplitude and a shorter duration than in GABAergic cells. These differences were due to the presence of a $\beta$-receptor-mediated EPSP enhancement in the glutamatergic cells. Together, our results suggest that multiple properties contribute to the disproportionate influence of glutamatergic BNST-AV neurons.",

Pavlovian procedures, such as place conditioning, have been widely used to study the rewarding/aversive properties of drugs and the association between environmental cues and drug seeking. Previous research has shown that ethanol as an unconditioned stimulus can induce a strong conditioned place preference (CPP) or aversion (CPA) in rodents. However, the neural mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced reward and aversion have not been thoroughly investigated. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), an integral part of the extended amygdala, is engaged by both rewarding and aversive stimuli and plays a role in ethanol-seeking behavior. Here, we used ex-vivo slice physiology to probe learning-induced synaptic plasticity in the BNST following ethanol-induced CPP and CPA. Male DBA/2 J mice (2-3 months old) were conditioned using previously reported ethanol-induced CPP/CPA procedures. Ethanol-induced CPP was associated with increased neuronal excitability in the ventral BNST (vBNST). Conversely, ethanol-induced CPA resulted in a significant decrease in spontaneous glutamatergic transmission without alterations in GABAergic signaling. Ethanol-CPA also led to a significant increase in the paired-pulse ratio at excitatory synapses, suggestive of a decrease in presynaptic glutamate release. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the vBNST is involved in the modulation of contextual learning associated with both the rewarding and the aversive properties of ethanol in mice.",

However, we recently found that postsynaptic $\alpha$2a-ARs are required for stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine-conditioned behavior. Understanding the ensembles recruited by these postsynaptic receptors (heteroceptors) is necessary to understand noradrenergic circuit control. We utilized a variety of approaches in FosTRAP (Targeted Recombination in Active Populations) mice to define an ensemble of cells activated by the $\alpha$2a-AR partial agonist guanfacine (``Guansembles'') in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST/BNST), a region key to stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. We define BNST ``Guansembles'' and show they differ from restraint stress-activated cells. Guanfacine produced inhibition of cAMP-dependent signaling in Guansembles, while chronic restraint stress increased cAMP-dependent signaling. Guanfacine both excited and inhibited aspects of Guansemble neuronal activity. Further, while some stressors produced overall reductions in Guansemble activity, active coping events during restraint stress and exposure to unexpected shocks were both associated with Guansemble recruitment. Using viral tracing, we define a BNST Guansemble afferent network that includes regions involved in the interplay of stress and homeostatic functions. Finally, we show that activation of Guansembles produces alterations in behavior on the elevated plus maze consistent with task-specific anxiety-like behavior. Overall, we define a population of BNST neurons recruited by $\alpha$2a-AR signaling that opposes the behavioral action of canonical autoreceptor $\alpha$2a-AR populations and which are differentially recruited by distinct stressors.

abstract = "The inability to discriminate between threat and safety is a hallmark of stress-induced psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdl) is critically involved in the modulation of fear and anxiety, and has been proposed to regulate discrimination between signaled (cued, predictable) and unsignaled (unpredictable) threats. We recently showed that oxytocin receptors (OTRs) in the BNSTdl facilitate acquisition of cued fear measured in a fear-potentiated startle (FPS). In the current study, using in vivo microdialysis in awake male Sprague-Dawley rats, a double immunofluorescence approach with confocal microscopy, as well as retrograde tracing of hypothalamic BNST-projecting OT neurons, we investigated whether fear conditioning activates OT system and modulates OT release. To determine the role of OTR in fear memory formation, we also infused OTR antagonist or OT into the BNSTdl before fear conditioning and measured rats' ability to discriminate between cued (signaled) and non-cued (unsignaled) fear using FPS. In contrast to acute stress (exposure to forced swim stress or foot shocks alone), cued fear conditioning increases OT content in BNSTdl microdialysates. In addition, fear conditioning induces moderate activation of OT neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and robust activation in the supraoptic and accessory nuclei of the hypothalamus. Application of OT into the BNSTdl facilitates fear learning toward signaled, predictable threats, whereas blocking OTR attenuates this effect. We conclude that OTR neurotransmission in the BNSTdl plays a pivotal role in strengthening fear learning of temporally predictable, signaled threats.",

Although dysfunction of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediates chronic stress-induced maladaptive affective behaviors that are historically associated with mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, it remains unknown whether ELS affects CRH function in the adult BNST. Here we applied a well-established ELS paradigm (24 h maternal separation (MS) at postnatal day 3) and assessed the effects on CRH signaling and electrophysiology in the oval nucleus of BNST (ovBNST) of adult male mouse offspring. ELS increased maladaptive affective behaviors, and amplified mEPSCs and decreased M-currents (a voltage-gated K+ current critical for stabilizing membrane potential) in ovBNST CRH neurons, suggesting enhanced cellular excitability. Furthermore, ELS increased the numbers of CRH+ and PACAP+ (the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, an upstream CRH regulator) cells and decreased STEP+ (striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase, a CRH inhibitor) cells in BNST. Interestingly, ELS also increased BNST brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, indicating enhanced neuronal plasticity. These electrophysiological and behavioral effects of ELS were reversed by chronic application of the CRHR1-selective antagonist R121919 into ovBNST, but not when BDNF was co-administered. In addition, the neurophysiological effects of BDNF on M-currents and mEPSCs in BNST CRH neurons mimic effects and were abolished by PKC antagonism. Together, our findings indicate that ELS results in a long-lasting activation of CRH signaling in the mouse ovBNST. These data highlight a regulatory role of CRHR1 in the BNST and for BDNF signaling in mediating ELS-induced long-term behavioral changes.",

author = "Cheng, He-Ming and Gao, Chen-Shu and Lou, Qiu-Wen and Chen, Zhong and Wang, Yi",
abstract = "The raphe nuclei comprise nearly all of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic (5-HTergic) neurons in the brain and are widely acknowledged to participate in the modulation of neural excitability. ``Excitability-inhibition imbalance'' results in a variety of brain disorders, including epilepsy. Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by hypersynchronous epileptic seizures accompanied by many psychological, social, cognitive consequences. Current antiepileptic drugs and other therapeutics are not ideal to control epilepsy and its comorbidities. Cumulative evidence suggests that the raphe nuclei and 5-HTergic system play an important role in epilepsy and epilepsy-associated comorbidities. Seizure activities propagate to the raphe nuclei and induce various alterations in different subregions of the raphe nuclei at the cellular and molecular levels. Intervention of the activity of raphe nuclei and raphe 5-HTergic system with pharmacological or genetic approaches, deep brain stimulation or optogenetics produces indeed diverse and even contradictory effects on seizure and epilepsy-associated comorbidities in different epilepsy models. Nevertheless, there are still many open questions left, especially regarding to the relationship between 5-HTergic neural circuit and epilepsy. Understanding of 5-HTergic network in a circuit- and molecule-specific way may not only be therapeutically relevant for increasing the drug specificity and precise treatment in epilepsy, but also provide critical hints for other brain disorders with abnormal neural excitability. In this review we focus on the roles of the raphe 5-HTergic system in epilepsy and epilepsy-associated comorbidities. Besides, further perspectives about the complexity and diversity of the raphe nuclei in epilepsy are also addressed.",

In the present study we describe that the CeA neuronal ensemble that is activated by withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure contains ~80\% corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons and that the optogenetic inactivation of these CeA CRF+ neurons prevents recruitment of the neuronal ensemble, decreases the escalation of alcohol drinking, and decreases the intensity of somatic signs of withdrawal. Optogenetic dissection of the downstream neuronal pathways demonstrates that the reversal of addiction-like behaviors is observed after the inhibition of CeA CRF projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and that inhibition of the CRFCeA-BNST pathway is mediated by inhibition of the CRF-CRF1 system and inhibition of BNST cell firing.

Silencing of these neurons attenuates the anorexia caused by these inflammatory signals. Our results demonstrate that these neurons mediate bidirectional control of general feeding behaviors. These neurons inhibit the lateral hypothalamus-projecting neurons in the ventrolateral part of BNST to regulate feeding, receive inputs from the canonical feeding regions of arcuate nucleus and parabrachial nucleus. Our data therefore define a BNST microcircuit that might coordinate canonical feeding centers to regulate food intake, which could offer therapeutic targets for feeding-related diseases such as anorexia and obesity.",

The severity of seizures is bidirectionally regulated by optogenetic manipulation of SNr PV fibers projecting to the parafascicular nucleus (PF). Electrophysiology combined with rabies virus-assisted circuit mapping shows that SNr PV neurons directly project to and functionally inhibit posterior PF GABAergic neurons. Activity of these neurons also regulates seizure activity. Collectively, our results reveal that a long-range SNr-PF disinhibitory circuit participates in regulating seizure in TLE and inactivation of this circuit can alleviate severity of epileptic seizures.

We demonstrate that activity in this circuit tightly follows struggling behavioral events and that the size of the fluorescent sensor transient reports the duration of the struggle event, an effect that fades with repeated exposure to the homotypic stressor. Struggle events are associated with enhanced glutamatergic- and decreased GABAergic signaling in the insular cortex, indicating the involvement of a larger circuit. We delineate the afferent network for this pathway, identifying substantial input from motor- and premotor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and the amygdala. To begin to dissect these incoming signals, we examine the motor cortex input, and show that the cells projecting from motor regions to insular cortex are engaged shortly before struggle event onset.

The exact mechanisms are unknown but death often follows a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Proposed mechanisms include seizure-related respiratory, cardiac, autonomic, and arousal dysfunction. Genetic drivers underlying SUDEP risk are largely unknown. To identify potential SUDEP risk genes, we compared whole-exome sequences (WES) derived from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded surgical brain specimens of eight epilepsy patients who died from SUDEP with seven living controls matched for age at surgery, sex, year of surgery and lobe of resection. We compared identified variants from both groups filtering known polymorphisms from publicly available data as well as scanned for epilepsy and candidate SUDEP genes. In the SUDEP cohort, we identified mutually exclusive variants in genes involved in µ-opiod signaling, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate-mediated synaptic signaling, including ARRB2, ITPR1, GABRR2, SSTR5, GRIK1, CTNAP2, GRM8, GNAI2 and GRIK5.

abstract = "Epileptic networks are intimately connected with the autonomic nervous system, as exemplified by a plethora of ictal (during a seizure) autonomic manifestations, including epigastric sensations, palpitations, goosebumps and syncope (fainting). Ictal autonomic changes might serve as diagnostic clues, provide targets for seizure detection and help us to understand the mechanisms that underlie sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Autonomic alterations are generally more prominent in focal seizures originating from the temporal lobe, demonstrating the importance of limbic structures to the autonomic nervous system, and are particularly pronounced in focal-to-bilateral and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The presence, type and severity of autonomic features are determined by the seizure onset zone, propagation pathways, lateralization and timing of the seizures, and the presence of interictal autonomic dysfunction. Evidence is mounting that not all autonomic manifestations are linked to SUDEP. In addition, experimental and clinical data emphasize the heterogeneity of SUDEP and its infrequent overlap with sudden cardiac death. Here, we review the spectrum and diagnostic value of the mostly benign and self-limiting autonomic manifestations of epilepsy. In particular, we focus on presentations that are likely to contribute to SUDEP and discuss how wearable devices might help to prevent SUDEP.",

abstract = "Advanced imaging methods now allow cell-type-specific recording of neural activity across the mammalian brain, potentially enabling the exploration of how brain-wide dynamical patterns give rise to complex behavioural states1--12. Dissociation is an altered behavioural state in which the integrity of experience is disrupted, resulting in reproducible cognitive phenomena including the dissociation of stimulus detection from stimulus-related affective responses. Dissociation can occur as a result of trauma, epilepsy or dissociative drug use13,14, but despite its substantial basic and clinical importance, the underlying neurophysiology of this state is unknown. Here we establish such a dissociation-like state in mice, induced by precisely-dosed administration of ketamine or phencyclidine. Large-scale imaging of neural activity revealed that these dissociative agents elicited a 1--3-Hz rhythm in layer 5 neurons of the retrosplenial cortex. Electrophysiological recording with four simultaneously deployed high-density probes revealed rhythmic coupling of the retrosplenial cortex with anatomically connected components of thalamus circuitry, but uncoupling from most other brain regions was observed---including a notable inverse correlation with frontally projecting thalamic nuclei. In testing for causal significance, we found that rhythmic optogenetic activation of retrosplenial cortex layer 5 neurons recapitulated dissociation-like behavioural effects. Local retrosplenial hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated potassium channel 1 (HCN1) pacemakers were required for systemic ketamine to induce this rhythm and to elicit dissociation-like behavioural effects. In a patient with focal epilepsy, simultaneous intracranial stereoencephalography recordings from across the brain revealed a similarly localized rhythm in the homologous deep posteromedial cortex that was temporally correlated with pre-seizure self-reported dissociation, and local brief electrical stimulation of this region elicited dissociative experiences. These results identify the molecular, cellular and physiological properties of a conserved deep posteromedial cortical rhythm that underlies states of dissociation.",

Heterozygous Scn1a knockout (Scn1a +/−) mice recapitulate the severe epilepsy phenotype of Dravet syndrome and are an accepted animal model. Because clinical observations suggest conventional sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs may worsen the disease, we predicted the phenotype of Scn1a +/− mice would be exacerbated by GS967, a potent, unconventional sodium channel blocker. Unexpectedly, GS967 significantly improved survival of Scn1a +/− mice and suppressed spontaneous seizures. By contrast, lamotrigine exacerbated the seizure phenotype. Electrophysiological recordings of acutely dissociated neurons revealed that chronic GS967-treatment had no impact on evoked action potential firing frequency of interneurons, but did suppress aberrant spontaneous firing of pyramidal neurons and was associated with significantly lower sodium current density. Lamotrigine had no effects on neuronal excitability of either neuron subtype. Additionally, chronically GS967-treated Scn1a +/− mice exhibited normalized pyramidal neuron sodium current density and reduced hippocampal NaV1.6 protein levels, whereas lamotrigine treatment had no effect on either pyramidal neuron sodium current or hippocampal NaV1.6 levels. Our findings demonstrate unexpected efficacy of a novel sodium channel blocker in Dravet syndrome and suggest a potential mechanism involving a secondary change in NaV1.6.",

These findings point to Scn8a as a promising therapeutic target for epilepsy and raise the possibility that aberrant overexpression of Scn8a in limbic structures may contribute to some epilepsies, including temporal lobe epilepsy. Using a small-hairpin-interfering RNA directed against the Scn8a gene, we selectively reduced Scn8a expression in the hippocampus of the intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

abstract = "The respiratory control system is plastic. It has a working memory and is capable of retaining how respiratory stimuli affect breathing by regulating synaptic strength between respiratory neurons. For example, repeated airway obstructions trigger a form of respiratory plasticity that strengthens inspiratory activity of hypoglossal (XII) motoneurons. This form of respiratory plasticity is known as long-term facilitation (LTF) and requires noradrenaline released onto XII motoneurons. However, the brainstem regions responsible for this form of LTF remain unidentified. Here, we used electrophysiology, neuropharmacology and immunohistochemistry in adult rats to identify the brainstem regions involved in mediating LTF. First, we show that repeated airway obstructions induce LTF of XII motoneuron activity and that inactivation of the noradrenergic system prevents LTF. Second, we show that noradrenergic cells in the locus coeruleus (LC), which project to XII motoneurons, are recruited during LTF induction. Third, we show that targeted inactivation of noradrenergic LC cells during LTF induction prevents LTF. And lastly, we show that the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), which has known projections to the LC, is critical for LTF because its inactivation prevents LTF. Our results suggest that both the LC and NTS are involved in mediating apnea-induced LTF, and we hypothesize that a NTS $\rightarrow$ LC $\rightarrow$ XII circuit mechanism mediates this form of respiratory motor plasticity.",

Here, we studied cellular electrical excitability, as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic neurotransmission of CA1 pyramidal neurons from the dorsal hippocampus of a genetic model of epilepsy, the Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WARs) in which limbic seizures appear after repeated audiogenic stimulation. We examined intrinsic properties of neurons, as well as EPSCs evoked by Schaffer-collateral stimulation in slices from WARs and Wistar parental strain. We also analyzed spontaneous IPSCs and quantal miniature inhibitory events. Our data show that even in the absence of previous seizures, GABAergic neurotransmission is reduced in the dorsal hippocampus of WARs. We observed a decrease in the frequency of IPSCs and mIPSCs. Moreover, mIPSCs of WARs had faster rise times, indicating that they probably arise from more proximal synapses. Finally, intrinsic membrane properties, firing and excitatory neurotransmission mediated by both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors are similar to the parental strain. Since GABAergic inhibition towards CA1 pyramidal neurons is reduced in WARs, the inhibitory network could be ineffective to prevent the seizure-dependent spread of hyperexcitation. These functional changes could make these animals more susceptible to the limbic seizures observed during the audiogenic kindling.",

Hippocampal neuronal damage induced by seizures may be one of the causes leading to cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanism remains to be further elucidated. The kainic acid (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy is widely used in understanding of the epileptogenesis. Fiber photometry is a signal detection technology suitable for recording calcium activity of neurons in the deep brain of freely moving animal. Here, we used the optical fiber-based method to monitor the real-time neuronal population activities of freely moving mice after subcutaneous injection of KA. We observed that KA administration led to one to three kinds of stereotypical patterns of epileptiform calcium activity in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, as well as the entorhinal cortex (EC). There were three kinds of waves in the hippocampal CA1, which we named wave 1, wave 2 and slow flash. Wave 1 and wave 2 appeared in both the CA3 and DG regions, but the EC only showed wave 1. In these epileptiform calcium signals, we observed a high amplitude and long duration calcium wave as a part of wave 2, which resembled cortical spreading depression (CSD) and always appeared at or after the end of seizure. Because the same characteristic of epileptiform calcium signal appeared in different brain regions, calcium signal may not exist with region specificity, but may exhibit a cell type specific manner. Thus, our work provides a support for the pathogenesis of epilepsy and epileptiform signal transmission research.",

We found that GABAergic signaling remains immature in both DS models, with a depolarized reversal potential for GABAA-evoked currents compared to wildtype in the third postnatal week. Treatment of Scn1b-/- mice with bumetanide resulted in a delay in SUDEP onset compared to controls in a subset of mice, without prevention of seizure activity or amelioration of failure to thrive.

abstract = "Dravet Syndrome (DS) is an encephalopathy with epilepsy associated with multiple neuropsychiatric comorbidities. In up to 90\% of cases, it is caused by functional happloinsufficiency of the SCN1A gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of a voltage-dependent sodium channel (Nav1.1). Preclinical development of new targeted therapies requires accessible animal models which recapitulate the disease at the genetic and clinical levels. Here we describe that a C57BL/6 J knock-in mouse strain carrying a heterozygous, clinically relevant SCN1A mutation (A1783V) presents a full spectrum of DS manifestations. This includes 70\% mortality rate during the first 8 weeks of age, reduced threshold for heat-induced seizures (4.7 °C lower compared with control littermates), cognitive impairment, motor disturbances, anxiety, hyperactive behavior and defects in the interaction with the environment. In contrast, sociability was relatively preserved. Electrophysiological studies showed spontaneous interictal epileptiform discharges, which increased in a temperature-dependent manner. Seizures were multifocal, with different origins within and across individuals. They showed intra/inter-hemispheric propagation and often resulted in generalized tonic-clonic seizures. 18F-labelled flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed a global increase in glucose uptake in the brain of Scn1aWT/A1783V mice. We conclude that the Scn1aWT/A1783V model is a robust research platform for the evaluation of new therapies against DS.",

abstract = "A better understanding of the early detection of seizures is highly desirable as identification of an impending seizure may afford improved treatments, such as antiepileptic drug chronotherapy, or timely warning to patients. While epileptic seizures are known to often manifest also with autonomic nervous system (ANS) changes, it is not clear whether ANS markers, if recorded from a wearable device, are also informative about an impending seizure with statistically significant sensitivity and specificity. Using statistical testing with seizure surrogate data and a unique dataset of continuously recorded multi-day wristband data including electrodermal activity (EDA), temperature (TEMP) and heart rate (HR) from 66 people with epilepsy (9.9 $\pm$ 5.8 years; 27 females; 161 seizures) we investigated differences between inter- and preictal periods in terms of mean, variance, and entropy of these signals. We found that signal mean and variance do not differentiate between inter- and preictal periods in a statistically meaningful way. EDA signal entropy was found to be increased prior to seizures in a small subset of patients. Findings may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of epileptic seizures with respect to ANS function, and, while further validation and investigation of potential causes of the observed changes are needed, indicate that epilepsy-related state changes may be detectable using peripheral wearable devices. Detection of such changes with wearable devices may be more feasible for everyday monitoring than utilizing an electroencephalogram.",

abstract = "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are diagnosed in approximately 30\% of patients referred to tertiary care epilepsy centers. Little is known about the molecular pathology of PNES, much less about possible underlying genetic factors. We generated whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome genotyping data to identify rare, pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants in 102 individuals with PNES and 448 individuals with focal (FE) or generalized (GE) epilepsy. Variants were classified for all individuals based on the ACMG-AMP 2015 guidelines. For research purposes only, we considered genes associated with neurological or psychiatric disorders as candidate genes for PNES. We observe in this first genetic investigation of PNES that six (5.88\%) individuals with PNES without coexistent epilepsy carry P/LP variants (deletions at 10q11.22-q11.23, 10q23.1-q23.2, distal 16p11.2, and 17p13.3, and nonsynonymous variants in NSD1 and GABRA5). Notably, the burden of P/LP variants among the individuals with PNES was similar and not significantly different to the burden observed in the individuals with FE (3.05\%) or GE (1.82\%) (PNES vs. FE vs. GE (3 $\times$ 2 $\chi$2), P = 0.30; PNES vs. epilepsy (2 $\times$ 2 $\chi$2), P = 0.14). The presence of variants in genes associated with monogenic forms of neurological and psychiatric disorders in individuals with PNES shows that genetic factors are likely to play a role in PNES or its comorbidities in a subset of individuals. Future large-scale genetic research studies are needed to further corroborate these interesting findings in PNES.",

The aim of this work was to characterize the spontaneous and synchronized rhythmic activity developed by cultured hippocampal neurons after transient incubation in zero Mg2+ to model Status Epilepticus. Cultured hippocampal neurons were transiently incubated with a Mg2+-free solution and the activity of neuronal networks was evaluated using single cell calcium imaging and whole-cell current clamp recordings. Here we report the development of synchronized and spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients in cultured hippocampal neurons immediately after transient incubation in a Mg2+-free solution. Spontaneous and synchronous [Ca2+]i oscillations were observed when the cells were then incubated in the presence of Mg2+. Functional studies also showed that transient incubation in Mg2+-free medium induces neuronal rhythmic burst activity that was prevented by antagonists of glutamate receptors. In conclusion, we report the development of epileptiform-like activity, characterized by spontaneous and synchronized discharges, in cultured hippocampal neurons transiently incubated in the absence of Mg2+. This model will allow studying synaptic alterations contributing to the hyperexcitability that underlies the development of seizures and will be useful in pharmacological studies for testing new drugs for the treatment of epilepsy.",

Pharmacological studies have found that inhibiting corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling in the BNST can selectively mitigate the sensory and affective-motivational components of pain. However, mechanistic insight on the source of CRF that drives BNST responses to these harmful experiences remains unknown. In the present study, we used a series of genetic approaches to show that CRF in the BNST is engaged in the processing and modulation of pain. We conducted cell-type specific in vivo calcium imaging in CRF-Cre mice and found robust and synchronized recruitment of BNSTCRF neurons during acute exposures to noxious heat. Distinct patterns of recruitment were observed by sex, as the magnitude and timing of heat responsive activity in BNSTCRF neurons differed for male and female mice. We then used a viral approach in Floxed-CRF mice to selectively reduce CRF expression in the BNST and found it decreased nociceptive sensitivity for both sexes and increased paw attending for females. Together, these findings reveal that CRF in the BNST influences multiple facets of the pain experience to impact the sex-specific expression of pain-related behaviors.",

abstract = "The endocannabinoid neurotransmission acting via local CB1 receptor in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has been implicated in behavioral and physiological responses to emotional stress. However, the neural network related to this control is poorly understood. In this sense, the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is involved in stress responses, and BNST GABAergic neurons densely innervate this hypothalamic nucleus. However, a role of BNST projections to the LH in physiological responses to stress is unknown. Therefore, using male rats, we investigated the role of LH GABAergic neurotransmission in the regulation of cardiovascular responses to stress by CB1 receptors within the BNST. We observed that microinjection of the selective CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 into the BNST decreased the number of Fos-immunoreactive cells within the LH of rats submitted to acute restraint stress. Treatment of the BNST with AM251 also enhanced restraint-evoked tachycardia. Nevertheless, arterial pressure increase and sympathetically-mediated cutaneous vasoconstriction to restraint was not affected by CB1 receptor antagonism within the BNST. The effect of AM251 in the BNST on restraint-evoked tachycardia was abolished in animals pretreated with the selective GABAA receptor antagonist SR95531 in the LH. These results indicate that regulation of cardiovascular responses to stress by CB1 receptors in the BNST is mediated by GABAergic neurotransmission in the LH. Present data also provide evidence of the BNST endocannabinoid neurotransmission as a mechanism involved in LH neuronal activation during stressful events.",

abstract = "Scents have been employed for millennia to allay stress, but whether or how they might do so is largely unknown. Fear and stress induce increases in blood stress hormones controlled by hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone neurons (CRHNs). Here, we report that two common odorants block mouse stress hormone responses to three potent stressors: physical restraint, predator odor, and male--male social confrontation. One odorant inhibits restraint and predator odor activation of excitatory neurons upstream of CRHNs in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTa). In addition, both activate inhibitory neurons upstream of CRHNs in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMH) and silencing of VMH inhibitory neurons hinders odor blocking of stress. Together, these findings indicate that odor blocking can occur via two mechanisms: (1) Inhibition of excitatory neurons that transmit stress signals to CRHNs and (2) activation of inhibitory neurons that act directly or indirectly to inhibit stressor activation of CRHNs.",

author = "Stafstrom, Carl E",
abstract = "Epilepsy is a common neurologic disorder that manifests in diverse ways. There are numerous seizure types and numerous mechanisms by which the brain generates seizures. The two hallmarks of seizure generation are hyperexcitability of neurons and hypersynchrony of neural circuits. A large variety of mechanisms alters the balance between excitation and inhibition to predispose a local or widespread region of the brain to hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony. This review discusses five clinical syndromes that have seizures as a prominent manifestation. These five syndromes differ markedly in their etiologies and clinical features, and were selected for discussion because the seizures are generated at a different 'level' of neural dysfunction in each case: (1) mutation of a specific family of ion (potassium) channels in benign familial neonatal convulsions; (2) deficiency of the protein that transports glucose into the CNS in Glut-1 deficiency; (3) aberrantly formed local neural circuits in focal cortical dysplasia; (4) synaptic reorganization of limbic circuitry in temporal lobe epilepsy; and (5) abnormal thalamocortical circuit function in childhood absence epilepsy. Despite this diversity of clinical phenotype and mechanism, these syndromes are informative as to how pathophysiological processes converge to produce brain hyperexcitability and seizures.",

abstract = "The effects of stress, including their putative contribution to pathological psychiatric conditions, are crucially governed by the age at which the stress takes place. However, the cellular and molecular foundations for the impact of stress on neuronal function, and their change with age, are unknown. For example, it is not known whether `psychological' stress signals are perceived by similar neuronal populations at different ages, and whether they activate similar or age-specific signaling pathways that might then mediate the spectrum of stress-evoked neuronal changes. We employed restraint and restraint/noise stress to address these issues in juvenile (postnatal day 18, [P18]) and adult rats, and used phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB (pCREB) and induction of c-fos as markers of hippocampal neuronal responses. Stress-activated neuronal populations were identified both anatomically and biochemically, and selective blockers of the stress-activated hippocampal peptide, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) were used to probe the role of this molecule in stress-induced hippocampal cell activation. Stress evoked strikingly different neuronal response patterns in immature vs adult hippocampus. Expression of pCREB appeared within minutes in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells of P18 rats, followed by delayed induction of Fos protein in the same cell population. In contrast, basal pCREB levels were high in adult hippocampus and were not altered at 10--120 min by stress. Whereas Fos induction was elicited by stress in the adult, it was essentially confined to area CA1, with little induction in CA3. At both age groups, central pretreatment with either a nonselective blocker of CRH receptors ($\alpha$-helical CRH [9--41]) or the CRF1-selective antagonist, NBI 30775, abolished stress-evoked neuronal activation. In conclusion, hippocampal neuronal responses to psychological stress are generally more rapid and robust in juvenile rats, compared to fully mature adults, and at both ages, CRH plays a key role in this process. Enhanced hippocampal response to stress during development, and particularly the activation of the transcription factor CREB, may contribute to the enduring effects of stress during this period on hippocampal function.",

abstract = "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is associated with high rates of depression and anxiety. A bidirectional causal relationship has been suggested, with these psychiatric comorbidities themselves enhancing epileptogenesis, possibly via hypercortisolemia. We examined the effects on epileptogenesis of chronic supplementation with low-dose corticosterone (CS) in the electrical amygdala kindling rat model. Adult Wistar rats were ovariectomized and implanted with bipolar electrodes into the left amygdala. After 1 week recovery, one group (n=7) had CS (3 mg/100 ml--approx. 4.5 mg/kg/day) and a control group saline (n=7) added to their drinking water, and both groups underwent twice daily electrical stimulations. Rats were culled 2 weeks after reaching the fully kindled state. A stereological optical fractionator technique was used to estimate the number of CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the stimulations. Fewer stimulations were required in the CS-supplemented rats than in controls to reach the fully kindled state (32 vs 81, p<0.03, Student's t-test) and the first Class V seizure (14 vs 57, p<0.05). The mean after-discharge length was greater in the CS group (p=0.03, repeated measures analysis of variance). There was no difference in the mean number of CA1 neurons (1.05 x 10(5) vs 1.04 x 10(5), p=0.98). These data demonstrate that low-dose CS enhances epileptogenesis in this model of MTLE. This provides support for the hypothesis that chronic hypercortisolemia, as a result of stress, anxiety, and/or depression, may facilitate the development and progression of epilepsy in patients with MTLE. The lack of difference in hippocampal CA1 neurons indicates that the mechanism does not primarily involve pyramidal cell loss.",

author = "Schubert, Manja and Albrecht, Doris",
abstract = "The amygdala is a component of the limbic system that plays a central role in emotional behavior and certain psychiatric diseases. Pathophysiological alterations of neuronal excitability in the amygdala are characteristic features of temporal lobe epilepsy and certain (epilepsy accompanying) psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and depressive disorders. The role of kainate receptors in the activity of synaptic networks, in brain function, and diseases is still poorly understood. Various kainate receptor subtypes have been shown to contribute to synaptic transmission and modulate presynaptic release of glutamate and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Several lines of evidence point to the importance of GLUK5 kainate receptors in epilepsy. In this study we investigated the role of specific GLUK5 kainate receptor in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA). The cellular mechanisms for emotional learning in the amygdala are believed to be the result of changes in synaptic transmission efficacy, similar to long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we used both field potential and intracellular recordings in horizontal rat amygdala slices, and showed that LTP in the LA, induced by high-frequency stimulation of afferents running within LA, is impaired 48 h after the last induced seizure. This kindling-induced impairment was reversed by the specific kainate GLUK5 agonist ATPA. Partial blockade of GABAergic transmission with the specific GABAA receptor antagonist SR95531 also significantly facilitated the induction of early LA-LTP, but only partially abolished the kindling-induced impairment of LA-LTP. This study shows that the stimulation of the GLUK5 kainate receptor subtype rescues the kindling-induced impairment of LA-LTP at least within 48 h after the last seizure. Therefore, GLUK5 kainate receptor subunits are involved in kindling-induced plasticity changes in the amygdala.Keywords: amygdala, kindling, horizontal brain slice, LTP, ATPA, SR95531",

abstract = "A highly conserved network of brain structures regulates the expression of fear and anxiety in mammals. Many of these structures display abnormal activity levels in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, some of them, like the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and amygdala, are comprised of several small sub-regions or nuclei that cannot be resolved with human neuroimaging techniques. Therefore, we used a well-characterized rat model of PTSD to compare neuronal properties in resilient vs PTSD-like rats using patch recordings obtained from different BNST and amygdala regions in vitro. In this model, a persistent state of extreme anxiety is induced in a subset of susceptible rats following predatory threat. Previous animal studies have revealed that the central amygdala (CeA) and BNST are differentially involved in the genesis of fear and anxiety-like states, respectively. Consistent with these earlier findings, we found that between resilient and PTSD-like rats were marked differences in the synaptic responsiveness of neurons in different sectors of BNST and CeA, but whose polarity was region specific. In light of prior data about the role of these regions, our results suggest that control of fear/anxiety expression is altered in PTSD-like rats such that the influence of CeA is minimized whereas that of BNST is enhanced. A model of the amygdalo-BNST interactions supporting the PTSD-like state is proposed.",

abstract = "The inherited neurometabolic disease d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is complicated by progressive neurodegeneration of vulnerable brain regions during infancy and early childhood, frequently presenting with hypotonia, epilepsy and psychomotor retardation. Here, we report that the pathogenetic role of the endogenously accumulating metabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2), which is structurally similar to the excitatory amino acid glutamate, is mediated by at least three mechanisms. (i) D-2-induced excitotoxic cell damage in primary neuronal cultures from chick and rat involved N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. Indeed, D-2 activated recombinant NMDA receptors (NR1/NR2A, NR1/NR2B) but not recombinant alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole (AMPA) receptors in HEK293 cells. (ii) Fluorescence microscopy using fura-2 as a calcium indicator and the oxidant-sensitive dye dihydrorhodamine-123 revealed that D-2 disturbed intracellular calcium homeostasis and elicited the generation of reactive oxygen species. (iii) D-2 reduced complex V (ATP synthase) activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, reflecting an impaired energy metabolism due to inhibition of ATP synthesis but without affecting the electron-transferring complexes I-IV. Thus, D-2 stimulates neurodegeneration by mechanisms well-known for glutamate, NMDA or mitochondrial toxins. In conclusion, excitotoxicity contributes to the neuropathology of d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, highlighting new neuroprotective strategies.",

METHODS: We prospectively collected blood samples from all patients admitted to our Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at baseline and after an event. Blood samples were analyzed, and serum prolactin level and WBC count were determined. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the relation of each type of seizure, its duration, and time lapse between a seizure and collection of blood sample to the serum prolactin level and peripheral WBC count. RESULTS: Serum prolactin level increases above twice the level at baseline after a complex partial seizure or a generalized seizure. Peripheral WBC count is elevated above the upper limit of normal in about one third of cases after a generalized seizure. In generalized seizures, the length of a seizure is positively associated, whereas the lapse time between the seizure onset and blood draw is negatively correlated with the increase in WBC count. Thus the longer the seizure and quicker the blood draw, the higher the WBC count. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that complex partial or generalized seizures are associated with an increase in serum prolactin level. Peripheral WBC count increases significantly after a generalized seizure and is probably transient in nature.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: Our aim is to outline the clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) features of patients with hot water epilepsy (HWE), a rare and unique form of reflex epilepsy. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with HWE, seen in our clinic until 1999, were studied. Male outnumbered female subjects in a ratio of 3:1. The age at the onset of seizures ranged from 19 months to 27 years (mean age at onset, 12 years). RESULTS: The main factors precipitating seizures were bathing with hot water and/or pouring water over the head. Six patients reported self-induction, either by increasing the heat or the amount of water and/or recalling earlier bathing experiences. Nine patients expressed feeling pleasure during the seizures. Twenty patients had partial seizures, eight of whom also had secondarily generalized seizures. One patient had apparent generalized seizures only. Spontaneous seizures were present in 62\% of the cases. Interictal epileptogenic abnormalities were documented in the EEGs of eight patients; the other eight had normal EEGs. The major sites of epileptogenic activity were over the unilateral temporal regions (in 40\% of patients). Neuroimaging studies available for 12 patients (four cranial computed tomography and eight cranial magnetic resonance imaging scans) revealed normal findings. Seizure control in patients who were followed up was achieved by reducing the temperature or the duration of the bath or shower; several of the patients required medication. CONCLUSIONS: The major findings of this study are that HWE has a male preponderance, can be self-induced, is often done for pleasure, has complex triggering factors, and shows temporally located abnormalities in the EEGs. Although HWE is generally known to be self-limited, antiepileptic drug treatment may sometimes be necessary to control seizures. Hot water epilepsy should be classified separately among the epileptic syndromes.",

abstract = "Summary: Purpose: We studied heart-rate (HR) changes at the transition from the preictal to the ictal state in patients with focal epilepsies to gain some insight into the mechanisms involved in the neuronal regulation of cardiovascular function. Methods: We assessed ECG changes during 145 seizures recorded with scalp EEG in 58 patients who underwent video-EEG monitoring. Consecutive RR intervals were analyzed with a newly developed mathematical method for a total of 90 s. Results: Ictal-onset tachycardia occurred in 86.9\% of all seizures, whereas bradycardia was documented only in 1.4\%. The incidence as well as the amount of ictal HR increase was significantly more pronounced in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as compared with those with non-lesional TLE or extratemporal epilepsy. Moreover, right hemispheric seizures were associated with ictal-onset tachycardia. On average, ictal HR increase preceded EEG seizure onset by 13.7 s in TLE patients and 8.2 s in patients with extratemporal epilepsy. This difference was significant. Ictal HR changes could be classified according to their temporal evolution into two different patterns. These two patterns differed significantly between the temporal lobe and the extratemporal epilepsy patient group. Conclusions: Epileptic discharges directly influence areas of the central autonomic network, thus regulating HR and rhythm. Such changes occur before ictal discharges appear on surface electrodes. Our newly developed method may be of potential use for clinical applications such as automatic seizure-detection systems. Moreover, our method might help to clarify further the basic mechanisms of interactions between heart and brain.",

Burst firing of action potentials is a potent mechanism for increasing neural synchrony and is thought to enhance cortical and thalamic rhythmic network activity. Absence seizures, a form of generalized epilepsy, occur in children as brief 5- to 10-s periods of behavioral arrest associated with massive 3- to 4-Hz spike-wave discharges in cortical and thalamic networks. Prior research has shown that enhanced burst firing may be crucial for the transition from normal to epileptic activity. Can enhanced burst firing in one region of the nervous system, such as the cortex, transform the entire thalamocortical network from normal activity to spike-and-wave seizures? Enhanced burst firing in corticothalamic neurons may increase gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB) receptor activation in the thalamus, leading to the slower, more synchronous oscillations seen in spike-and-wave seizures. Does ``generalized'' spike-wave activity homogeneously involve the entire brain, or are there crucial nodes that are more important than others for the generation and behavioral manifestations of generalized seizures? Animal and human data suggest that so-called generalized seizures involve selective thalamocortical networks while sparing others. A greater understanding of these molecular and network mechanisms will ultimately lead to improved targeted therapies for generalized epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Epilepsy genetics has undergone a revolution in the past 19 years since the discovery of the first gene for epilepsy. The story of our increasing knowledge and how it impacts on patient care is presented with reference to recent discoveries. Understanding the significance of a genetic variant is challenging both in terms of molecular pathogenicity and in how this finding fits into the rubric of causation. In some cases, it may only be a contributing susceptibility factor; whereas in others, it explains the patient's disease. METHODS: A brief overview of the clinicomolecular approaches is discussed in the context of the discovery of epilepsy genes. These include family studies and, more recently, next generation sequencing using multigene panels and whole exome sequencing. RESULTS: Recent studies illustrating the way in which epilepsy genetics is changing clinical practice are described. A particular focus is DEPDC5, the first gene for nonlesional focal epilepsy likely to be relevant to sporadic patients with focal epilepsies and those from small families, in contrast to rare large families with autosomal dominant focal epilepsies. As DEPDC5 is a negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, it is likely that some patients with DEPDC5 mutations may have malformations of cortical development akin to the two-hit hypothesis suggested in tuberous sclerosis. The greatest impact of epilepsy genetics at a clinical level is for patients with epileptic encephalopathies as many have de novo mutations-a rapidly expanding list of causative genes is being found. CONCLUSION: Epilepsy genetics is changing clinical practice enabling diagnosis in many patients, informing our understanding of comorbidities, prognosis, and genetic counseling. Importantly, a genetic finding may impact on treatment choices. At a biological level, new insights promise to lead to the development of novel therapies and bring together the seemingly disparate genetics of nonlesional epilepsies and epilepsies associated with cortical malformations.",

Later seizures may occur as specific patterns, such as in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or with combinations of seizures including focal and multifocal seizures, and drop attacks. Most patients have two or more seizure types. Seizure control using current antiepileptic drugs is often unsatisfactory, leading to frequent polypharmacy. Epilepsy surgery has a place in the management of some patients. Mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes that cause tuberous sclerosis lead to hyperactivation of signaling via the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).

abstract = "The mRNA levels of NKCC1, an inwardly directed Na+, K+-2Cl− cotransporter that facilitates the accumulation of intracellular Cl−, and of KCC2, an outwardly directed K+-Cl− cotransporter that extrudes Cl−, were studied in surgically resected brain specimens from drug-resistant temporal lobe (TL) epilepsy (TLE) patients. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the mRNAs extracted from the human TLE-associated brain regions revealed an up-regulation of NKCC1 mRNA and a down-regulation of KCC2 mRNA in the hippocampal subiculum, compared with the hippocampus proper or the TL neocortex, suggesting an abnormal transcription of Cl− transporters in the TLE subiculum. In parallel experiments, cell membranes isolated from the same TLE-associated brain regions were injected into Xenopus oocytes that rapidly incorporated human GABAA receptors into their surface membrane. The GABA currents elicited in oocytes injected with membranes from the subiculum had a more depolarized reversal potential (E GABA) compared with the hippocampus proper or the neocortex. The NKCC1 blocker bumetanide or a temperature decrease of 10°C shifted the GABA-current E GABA more negative in oocytes injected with membranes from TLE hippocampal subiculum, matching the E GABA of TL neocortex-injected oocytes. We conclude that the anomalous expression of both Cl− transporters, KCC1 and NKCC2, in TLE hippocampal subiculum probably causes altered Cl− transport in the ``epileptic'' neurons, as revealed in the microtransplanted Xenopus oocytes, and renders GABA aberrantly ``exciting,'' a feature that may contribute to the precipitation of epileptic seizures.",

Here, we show that there is a marked increase in wakefulness when all serotonin neurons are genetically deleted in mice hemizygous for ePet1-Cre and homozygous for floxed Lmx1b (Lmx1b(f/f/p)). However, this only occurs at cool ambient temperatures and can be explained by a thermoregulatory defect that leads to an increase in motor activity to generate heat. Because some serotonin neurons are stimulated by CO(2), and serotonin activates thalamocortical networks, we hypothesized that serotonin neurons cause arousal in response to hypercapnia. We found that Lmx1b(f/f/p) mice completely lacked any arousal response to inhalation of 10\% CO(2) (with 21\% O(2) in balance N(2)) but had normal arousal responses to hypoxia, sound, and air puff. We propose that serotonin neurons mediate the potentially life-saving arousal response to hypercapnia. Impairment of this response may contribute to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, sudden infant death syndrome, and sleep apnea.",

Previous studies using a mouse model of DS revealed reduced sodium currents and impaired excitability in GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus, leading to the hypothesis that impaired excitability of GABAergic inhibitory neurons is the cause of epilepsy and premature death in DS. However, other classes of GABAergic interneurons are less impaired, so the direct cause of hyperexcitability, epilepsy, and premature death has remained unresolved. We generated a floxed Scn1a mouse line and used the Cre-Lox method driven by an enhancer from the Dlx1,2 locus for conditional deletion of Scn1a in forebrain GABAergic neurons. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated selective loss of Na(V)1.1 channels in GABAergic interneurons in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Mice with this deletion died prematurely following generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and they were equally susceptible to thermal induction of seizures as mice with global deletion of Scn1a. Evidently, loss of Na(V)1.1 channels in forebrain GABAergic neurons is both necessary and sufficient to cause epilepsy and premature death in DS.",

Specific heterozygous deletion of NaV1.1 in forebrain GABAergic-inhibitory neurons is sufficient to cause all the manifestations of Dravet syndrome in mice, but the physiological roles of specific subtypes of GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex in this disease are unknown. Voltage-clamp studies of dissociated interneurons from cerebral cortex did not detect a significant effect of the Dravet syndrome mutation on sodium currents in cell bodies. However, current-clamp recordings of intact interneurons in layer V of neocortical slices from mice with haploinsufficiency in the gene encoding the NaV1.1 sodium channel, Scn1a, revealed substantial reduction of excitability in fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. The threshold and rheobase for action potential generation were increased, the frequency of action potentials within trains was decreased, and action-potential firing within trains failed more frequently. Furthermore, the deficit in excitability of somatostatin-expressing interneurons caused significant reduction in frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition between neighboring layer V pyramidal neurons mediated by somatostatin-expressing Martinotti cells, which would lead to substantial disinhibition of the output of cortical circuits. In contrast to these deficits in interneurons, pyramidal cells showed no differences in excitability. These results reveal that the two major subtypes of interneurons in layer V of the neocortex, parvalbumin-expressing and somatostatin-expressing, both have impaired excitability, resulting in disinhibition of the cortical network.

Genetic autopsies have detected ``leaky'' gain-of-function mutations in the ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2) gene in both SUDEP and sudden cardiac death cases linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that feature lethal cardiac arrhythmias without structural abnormality. Here we find that a human leaky RyR2 mutation, R176Q (RQ), alters neurotransmitter release probability in mice and significantly lowers the threshold for spreading depolarization (SD) in dorsal medulla, leading to cardiorespiratory collapse. Rare episodes of sinus bradycardia, spontaneous seizure, and sudden death were detected in RQ/+ mutant mice in vivo; however, when provoked, cortical seizures frequently led to apneas, brainstem SD, cardiorespiratory failure, and death. In vitro studies revealed that the RQ mutation selectively strengthened excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses and facilitated SD in both the neocortex as well as brainstem dorsal medulla autonomic microcircuits. These data link defects in neuronal intracellular calcium homeostasis to the vulnerability of central autonomic brainstem pathways to hypoxic stress and implicate brainstem SD as a previously unrecognized site and mechanism contributing to premature death in individuals with leaky RYR2 mutations.",

Here, we investigated the cardiac phenotype of a mouse model expressing the gain of function EIEE13 patient mutation p.Asn1768Asp in Scn8a (Nav1.6-N1768D). We tested Scn8a(N1768D/+) mice for alterations in cardiac excitability. We observed prolongation of the early stages of action potential (AP) repolarization in mutant myocytes vs. CONTROLS: Scn8a(N1768D/+) myocytes were hyperexcitable, with a lowered threshold for AP firing, increased incidence of delayed afterdepolarizations, increased calcium transient duration, increased incidence of diastolic calcium release, and ectopic contractility. Calcium transient duration and diastolic calcium release in the mutant myocytes were tetrodotoxin-sensitive. A selective inhibitor of reverse mode Na/Ca exchange blocked the increased incidence of diastolic calcium release in mutant cells. Scn8a(N1768D/+) mice exhibited bradycardia compared with controls. This difference in heart rate dissipated after administration of norepinephrine, and there were no differences in heart rate in denervated ex vivo hearts, implicating parasympathetic hyperexcitability in the Scn8a(N1768D/+) animals. When challenged with norepinephrine and caffeine to simulate a catecholaminergic surge, Scn8a(N1768D/+) mice showed ventricular arrhythmias. Two of three mutant mice under continuous ECG telemetry recording experienced death, with severe bradycardia preceding asystole. Thus, in addition to central neuron hyperexcitability, Scn8a(N1768D/+) mice have cardiac myoycte and parasympathetic neuron hyperexcitability.

Here we show that cannabidiol (CBD) effectively reduced seizures and autistic-like social deficits in a well-validated mouse genetic model of Dravet syndrome (DS), a severe childhood epilepsy disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the brain voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.1. The duration and severity of thermally induced seizures and the frequency of spontaneous seizures were substantially decreased. Treatment with lower doses of CBD also improved autistic-like social interaction deficits in DS mice. Phenotypic rescue was associated with restoration of the excitability of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, an important area for seizure propagation. Reduced excitability of dentate granule neurons in response to strong depolarizing stimuli was also observed. The beneficial effects of CBD on inhibitory neurotransmission were mimicked and occluded by an antagonist of GPR55, suggesting that therapeutic effects of CBD are mediated through this lipid-activated G protein-coupled receptor. Our results provide critical preclinical evidence supporting treatment of epilepsy and autistic-like behaviors linked to DS with CBD.

abstract = "Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic, pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy. Disease onset occurs in the first year of life, followed by developmental delay with cognitive and behavioral dysfunction and substantially elevated risk of premature death. The majority of affected individuals harbor a loss-of-function mutation in one allele of SCN1A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.1. Brain NaV1.1 is primarily localized to fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons; thus the mechanism of epileptogenesis in Dravet syndrome is hypothesized to be reduced inhibitory neurotransmission leading to brain hyperexcitability. We show that selective activation of NaV1.1 by venom peptide Hm1a restores the function of inhibitory interneurons from Dravet syndrome mice without affecting the firing of excitatory neurons. Intracerebroventricular infusion of Hm1a rescues Dravet syndrome mice from seizures and premature death. This precision medicine approach, which specifically targets the molecular deficit in Dravet syndrome, presents an opportunity for treatment of this intractable epilepsy.",

abstract = "Impulsivity is closely associated with addictive disorders, and changes in the brain dopamine system have been proposed to affect impulse control in reward-related behaviors. However, the central neural pathways through which the dopamine system controls impulsive behavior are still unclear. We found that the absence of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) increased impulsive behavior in mice, whereas restoration of D2R expression specifically in the central amygdala (CeA) of D2R knockout mice (Drd2 -/- ) normalized their enhanced impulsivity. Inhibitory synaptic output from D2R-expressing neurons in the CeA underlies modulation of impulsive behavior because optogenetic activation of D2R-positive inhibitory neurons that project from the CeA to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) attenuate such behavior. Our identification of the key contribution of D2R-expressing neurons in the CeA $\rightarrow$ BNST circuit to the control of impulsive behavior reveals a pathway that could serve as a target for approaches to the management of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impulsivity.",

Local gene deletion caused selective reduction of inhibitory neurotransmission measured in dentate granule cells. Mice with local NaV1.1 reduction had thermally evoked seizures and spatial learning deficits, but they did not have abnormalities of locomotor activity or social interaction. Our results show that local gene deletion in the hippocampus can induce two of the most severe dysfunctions of Dravet Syndrome: Epilepsy and cognitive deficit.

To address this gap, we optogenetically silenced cell bodies within SNpr, nigrotectal terminals within DLSC, and nigrotegmental terminals within PPN. Inhibition of cell bodies in SNpr suppressed generalized seizures evoked by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), partial seizures evoked from the forebrain, absence seizures evoked by gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), and audiogenic seizures in genetically epilepsy-prone rats. Strikingly, these effects were fully recapitulated by silencing nigrotectal projections. By contrast, silencing nigrotegmental terminals reduced only absence seizures and exacerbated seizures evoked by PTZ. These data underscore the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant efficacy of this circuit, and demonstrate that specific efferent projection pathways differentially control different seizure types.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is a devastating brain disorder for which effective treatments are very limited. There is growing interest in early intervention, which requires a better mechanistic understanding of the early stages of this disorder. While diverse brain insults can lead to epileptic activity, a common cellular mechanism relies on uncontrolled recurrent excitatory activity. In the dentate gyrus, excitatory mossy cells (MCs) project extensively onto granule cells (GCs) throughout the hippocampus, thus establishing a recurrent MC-GC-MC excitatory loop. MCs are implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy, a common form of epilepsy, but their role during initial seizures (i.e., before the characteristic MC loss that occurs in late stages) is unclear. Here, we show that initial seizures acutely induced with an intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) injection in adult mice, a well-established model that leads to experimental epilepsy, not only increased MC and GC activity in vivo but also triggered a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at MC-GC excitatory synapses. Moreover, in vivo induction of MC-GC LTP using MC-selective optogenetic stimulation worsened KA-induced seizures. Conversely, Bdnf genetic removal from GCs, which abolishes LTP, and selective MC silencing were both anticonvulsant. Thus, initial seizures are associated with MC-GC synaptic strengthening, which may promote later epileptic activity. Our findings reveal a potential mechanism of epileptogenesis that may help in developing therapeutic strategies for early intervention.",

abstract = "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a prevalent neurological disorder with many patients experiencing poor seizure control with existing anti-epileptic drugs. Thus, novel insights into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis and the identification of new drug targets can be transformative. Changes in ion channel function have been shown to play a role in generating the aberrant neuronal activity observed in TLE. Previous work demonstrates that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels regulate neuronal excitability and are mislocalized within CA1 pyramidal cells in a rodent model of TLE. The subcellular distribution of HCN channels is regulated by an auxiliary subunit, tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b), and disruption of this interaction correlates with channel mislocalization. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for HCN channel dysregulation in TLE are unclear. In this report, we investigated whether changes in TRIP8b phosphorylation are sufficient to alter HCN channel function. We identified a phosphorylation site at residue S237 of TRIP8b that enhances binding to HCN channels and influences channel gating by altering the affinity of TRIP8b for the HCN cytoplasmic domain. Using a phosphospecific antibody, we demonstrate that TRIP8b phosphorylated at S237 is enriched in the CA1 distal dendrites and that phosphorylation is reduced in the kainic acid model of TLE. Overall, our findings indicate that the TRIP8b-HCN interaction can be modulated by changes in phosphorylation and suggest that the loss of TRIP8b phosphorylation may impact HCN channel properties during epileptogenesis. These results highlight the potential of drugs targeting post-translational modifications to restore TRIP8b phosphorylation to reduce excitability in TLE.",

Before and after selAH, we recorded microcirculation parameters on the superficial cortex surrounding the surgical corridor. Blood flow and velocity were measured using laser Doppler flowmetry and micro-Doppler, respectively. Cortical oxygen saturation (SO2) was measured using remission spectrophotometry under hypocapnic and normocapnic conditions.Results: Ten patients were operated using the TS approach, and eight were operated via the TC approach. Vasomotor reactivity patterns measured with micro-Doppler were physiologically prior to selAH in both groups. After completion of surgery, a significant increase in SO2-values occurred in the TS group (before: 56.7 $\pm$ 2.2, after: 65.5 $\pm$ 3.0\%SO2), but not in the TC group (before: 52.9 $\pm$ 5.2, after: 53.0 $\pm$ 3.7\%SO2). The rate of critical SO2 values below 25\% was significantly higher after the TC approach (12.3\%) compared to the TS approach (5.2\%; p < 0.05).Discussion: Our findings provide the first invasively measured evidence that patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have preserved cerebral blood flow responses to alterations in CO2. In addition, local cortical SO2 was higher in the TS group than in the TC group after selAH. This may be a sign of reactive cortical vessel dilation after proximal vessel manipulation associated with the TS approach. In contrast, the lower values of SO2 after the TC approach indicate tissue ischaemia surrounding the surgical corridor surrounding the corticotomy.",

abstract = "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the most common epilepsy in adults, is generally intractable and is suspected to be the result of recurrent excitation or inhibition circuitry. Recurrent excitation and the development of seizures have been associated with aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in the hippocampus. Of the animal models developed to investigate the pathogenesis of MTLE, post-status epilepticus models have received the greatest acceptance because they are characterized by a latency period, the development of spontaneous motor seizures, and a spectrum of lesions like those of MTLE. Among post-status epilepticus models, induction of systemic kainic acid or pilocarpine-induced epilepsy is less labor-intensive than electrical-stimulation models and these models mirror the clinicopathologic features of MTLE more closely than do kindling, tetanus toxin, hyperthermia, post-traumatic, and perinatal hypoxia/ischemia models. Unfortunately, spontaneous motor seizures do not develop in kindling or adult hyperthermia models and are not a consistent finding in tetanus toxin-induced or perinatal hypoxia/ischemia models. This review presents the mechanistic hypotheses for seizure induction, means of model induction, and associated pathology, especially as compared to MTLE patients. Animal models are valuable tools not only to study the pathogenesis of MTLE, but also to evaluate potential antiepileptogenic drugs.",

abstract = "In this narrative review, we will discuss some of the significant risks and dramatic consequences that are associated with epilepsy: depression, suicide, seizure-related injuries, and mortality, both in adults and in children. Considering the high prevalence of depression among people with epilepsy (PWE), routine and periodic screening of all PWE for early detection and appropriate management of depression is recommended. PWE should be screened for suicidal ideation regularly and when needed, patients should be referred for a psychiatric evaluation and treatment. When starting an antiepileptic drug (AED) or switching from one to another AED, patients should be advised to report to their treating physician any change in their mood and existence of suicidal ideation. The risk of injuries for the general epilepsy population is increased only moderately. The risk is higher in selected populations attending epilepsy clinics and referral centers. This being said, there are PWE that may suffer frequent, severe, and sometimes even life-threatening seizure-related injuries. The most obvious way to reduce risk is to strive for improved seizure control. Finally, PWE have a 2-3 times higher mortality rate than the general population. Deaths in PWE may relate to the underlying cause of epilepsy, to seizures (including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy [SUDEP] and seizure related injuries) and to status epilepticus, as well as to other conditions that do not appear directly related to epilepsy. Improving seizure control and patient education may be the most important measures to reduce epilepsy related mortality in general and SUDEP in particular.",

Areas covered: The current understanding of static and modifiable risk factors for SUDEP and how to manage these more effectively are reviewed. Longitudinal risk may be assessed using standardised risk assessment tools which help in communicating risk. Technological advancement allows measurement of physiological parameters associated with seizures and risk of SUDEP using small wearable devices. Further evidence is needed to demonstrate such technologies are efficacious and safe.

APPROACH: Data from eight patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery (age [Formula: see text], three female) with intracranial depth electrodes for iEEG monitoring were included. Spectral power features (0.1-235 Hz) spanning several frequency bands from a single electrode were used to classify behavioral states of patients into AW, N2, and N3. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, classification accuracy of 94\%, with 94\% sensitivity and 93\% specificity across eight subjects using multiple spectral power features from a single electrode was achieved. Classification performance of N3 sleep was significantly better (95\%, sensitivity 95\%, specificity 93\%) than that of the N2 sleep phase (87\%, sensitivity 78\%, specificity 96\%).

The circuitry of the extended amygdala, including the central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) nuclei of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), has been well defined in nonhuman animals; however, much less is known about the roles and interactions of these structures in humans given their small size. Therefore, this study used high-resolution 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging to define, compare, and contrast functional connectivity (FC) of these structures in 57 neurologically healthy young adults. In addition, FC was investigated in relation to self-reported measures of anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty, a key feature of anxiety. Results of the FC analysis of each of the nuclei largely replicated previous work. Conjunction analyses showed that nuclei of the extended amygdala shared FC with hippocampal, cingulate, medial prefrontal, and subgenual cortices. Comparison of seed-to-voxel time series correlation maps demonstrated that compared with the BNST, the CeA and BLA were more strongly coupled with parahippocampal, temporal, fusiform, and occipital gyri. Relative to the CeA and BLA, the BNST was more strongly coupled with the anterior caudate and anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty were not robustly related to FC of the extended amygdala at rest. Results of this study extend previous work to provide more clarity of the nuances of extended amygdala resting FC and its relationship with anxiety.",

abstract = "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene encoding the $\alpha$ subunit of the NaV1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel that controls neuronal action potential firing. The high density of this mutated channel in GABAergic interneurons results in impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and subsequent excessive activation of excitatory neurons. The syndrome is associated with severe childhood epilepsy, autistic behaviors, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Here, we compared the rescue effects of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector coding for the multifunctional $\beta$1 sodium channel auxiliary subunit (AAV-NaV$\beta$1) with a control vector lacking a transgene. We hypothesized that overexpression of NaV$\beta$1 would facilitate the function of residual voltage-gated channels and improve the DS phenotype in the Scn1a+/- mouse model of DS. AAV-NaV$\beta$1 was injected into the cerebral spinal fluid of neonatal Scn1a+/- mice. In untreated control Scn1a+/- mice, females showed a higher degree of mortality than males. Compared with Scn1a+/- control mice, AAV-NaV$\beta$1-treated Scn1a+/- mice displayed increased survival, an outcome that was more pronounced in females than males. In contrast, behavioral analysis revealed that male, but not female, Scn1a+/- mice displayed motor hyperactivity, and abnormal performance on tests of fear and anxiety and learning and memory. Male Scn1a+/- mice treated with AAV-NaV$\beta$1 showed reduced spontaneous seizures and normalization of motor activity and performance on the elevated plus maze test. These findings demonstrate sex differences in mortality in untreated Scn1a+/- mice, an effect that may be related to a lower level of intrinsic inhibitory tone in female mice, and a normalization of aberrant behaviors in males after central nervous system administration of AAV-NaV$\beta$1. The therapeutic efficacy of AAV-NaV$\beta$1 in a mouse model of DS suggests a potential new long-lasting biological therapeutic avenue for the treatment of this catastrophic epilepsy.",

METHODS: The study included resting state fMRI scans from participants aged 21-40 years: 20 participants with AUD in abstinence and 20 healthy controls. Analyses were restricted to five pre-selected brain regions with known BNST structural connections. Linear mixed models were used to test for group differences, with sex as a fixed factor given previously shown sex differences. RESULTS: BNST-hypothalamus intrinsic connectivity was lower in the abstinent group relative to the control group. There were also pronounced sex differences in both the group and individual analyses; many of the findings were specific to men. Within the abstinent group, anxiety was positively associated with BNST-amygdala and BNST-hypothalamus connectivity, and men, not women, showed a negative relationship between alcohol use severity and BNST-hypothalamus connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding differences in connectivity during abstinence may help explain the clinically observed anxiety and depression symptoms during abstinence and may inform the development of individualized treatments.",

abstract = "Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a common derangement in many patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. As a result of neuronal cell loss in the hilar region of the hippocampus, it is proposed that mossy fibres sprout and re-innervate new regions of the dentate gyrus. This sprouting may cause recurrent excitation that may lead to the generation of seizures. Here, we determined neuronal density, and synaptophysin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity in hippocampal specimens from patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Patients were classified into two groups: those with severe and those with no HS. Non-epileptic autopsy tissue served as controls. Mossy fibre sprouting was investigated in these two groups of epilepsy patients using Timm's staining and an immunohistochemical staining of the presynaptic growth-associated protein B-50 (also known as GAP-43, neuromodulin, F1). B-50 immunoreactivity in the different sub-areas of the hippocampus was quantified by image analysis. Our results show the following: (i) in both groups of temporal lobe epilepsy patients, there was a significant loss in cell number in all major hippocampal sub-areas compared with autopsy control tissue; (ii) in HS patients, when compared with non-HS patients, there was a further decline in the number of principal cells in all hippocampal sub-areas analysed, which was associated with an increase in GFAP immunoreactivity; (iii) the decline in cell density was accompanied by a reduced number of synaptic terminals; (iv) in the HS group, there were sprouted mossy fibres in the supragranular layer (SGL) of the dentate gyrus; (v) there was an increase in synaptophysin immunostaining in the SGL indicating that functionally active nerve terminals were formed; and (vi) B-50 immunoreactivity was also increased in the SGL in the HS group compared with the non-HS and control groups. These data showed that all temporal lobe epilepsy hippocampi investigated had severe neuronal cell loss which was most dramatic in the HS group, where it was accompanied by a severe loss of synapses. In the HS group, mossy fibre sprouting into the SGL was found. The increase in B-50 immunoreactivity in the SGL indicated that there was still active sprouting. This sprouting was accompanied by an increased density of synapses, indicating that mossy fibre terminals are not only anatomically present, but probably also functional. Thus, functional glutamatergic mossy fibre terminals are in the right position to synapse on to the dendrites of granule cells and thus may contribute to the onset of seizures.",

abstract = "Missense variants in the SCN8A voltage-gated sodium channel gene are linked to early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 13, also known as SCN8A-related epilepsy. These patients exhibit a wide spectrum of intractable seizure types, severe developmental delay, movement disorders, and elevated risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. The mechanisms by which SCN8A variants lead to epilepsy are poorly understood, although heterologous expression systems and mouse models have demonstrated altered sodium current properties. To investigate these mechanisms using a patient-specific model, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells from three patients with missense variants in SCN8A: p.R1872>L (Patient 1); p.V1592>L (Patient 2); and p.N1759>S (Patient 3). Using small molecule differentiation into excitatory neurons, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from all three patients displayed altered sodium currents. Patients 1 and 2 had elevated persistent current, while Patient 3 had increased resurgent current compared to controls. Neurons from all three patients displayed shorter axon initial segment lengths compared to controls. Further analyses focused on one of the patients with increased persistent sodium current (Patient 1) and the patient with increased resurgent current (Patient 3). Excitatory cortical neurons from both patients had prolonged action potential repolarization. Using doxycycline-inducible expression of the neuronal transcription factors neurogenin 1 and 2 to synchronize differentiation of induced excitatory cortical-like neurons, we investigated network activity and response to pharmacotherapies. Both small molecule differentiated and induced patient neurons displayed similar abnormalities in action potential repolarization. Patient induced neurons showed increased burstiness that was sensitive to phenytoin, currently a standard treatment for SCN8A-related epilepsy patients, or riluzole, an FDA-approved drug used in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and known to block persistent and resurgent sodium currents, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Patch-clamp recordings showed that riluzole suppressed spontaneous firing and increased the action potential firing threshold of patient-derived neurons to more depolarized potentials. Two of the patients in this study were prescribed riluzole off-label. Patient 1 had a 50\% reduction in seizure frequency. Patient 3 experienced an immediate and dramatic seizure reduction with months of seizure freedom. An additional patient with a SCN8A variant in domain IV of Nav1.6 (p.V1757>I) had a dramatic reduction in seizure frequency for several months after starting riluzole treatment, but then seizures recurred. Our results indicate that patient-specific neurons are useful for modelling SCN8A-related epilepsy and demonstrate SCN8A variant-specific mechanisms. Moreover, these findings suggest that patient-specific neuronal disease modelling offers a useful platform for discovering precision epilepsy therapies.",

abstract = "Accurate and individualized prediction of response to therapies is central to precision medicine. However, due to the generally complex and multifaceted nature of clinical drug response, realizing this vision is highly challenging, requiring integrating different data types from the same individual into one prediction model. We use the anti-epileptic drug brivaracetam as a case study and combine a hybrid data-/knowledge-driven feature extraction with machine learning to systematically integrate clinical and genetic data from a clinical discovery dataset (n = 235 patients). As such, we construct a model that successfully predicts clinical drug response (AUC = 0.76) and show that even with limited sample size, integrating high-dimensional genetics data with clinical data can inform drug response prediction. After a further validation on data collected from an independently conducted clinical study (AUC = 0.75), we extensively explore our model to gain insights into the determinants of drug response, and identify various clinical and genetic characteristics predisposing to poor response. Finally, we assess the potential impact of our model on clinical trial design and demonstrate that, by enriching for probable responders, significant reductions in clinical study sizes may be achieved. To our knowledge, our model represents the first retrospectively validated machine learning model linking drug mechanism of action and the genetic, clinical and demographic background in epilepsy patients to clinical drug response. Hence, it provides a blueprint for how machine learning-based multimodal data integration can act as a driver in achieving the goals of precision medicine in fields such as neurology.",

author = "Aiba, Isamu and Noebels, Jeffrey L",
abstract = "Spreading depolarization is a slowly propagating wave of massive cellular depolarization associated with acute brain injury and migraine aura. Genetic studies link depolarizing molecular defects in Ca2+ flux, Na+ current in interneurons, and glial Na+-K+ ATPase with spreading depolarization susceptibility, emphasizing the important roles of synaptic activity and extracellular ionic homeostasis in determining spreading depolarization threshold. In contrast, although gene mutations in voltage-gated potassium ion channels that shape intrinsic membrane excitability are frequently associated with epilepsy susceptibility, it is not known whether epileptogenic mutations that regulate membrane repolarization also modify spreading depolarization threshold and propagation. Here we report that the Kcnq2/Kv7.2 potassium channel subunit, frequently mutated in developmental epilepsy, is a spreading depolarization modulatory gene with significant control over the seizure-spreading depolarization transition threshold, bi-hemispheric cortical expression, and diurnal temporal susceptibility. Chronic DC-band cortical EEG recording from behaving conditional Kcnq2 deletion mice (Emx1cre/+::Kcnq2flox/flox) revealed spontaneous cortical seizures and spreading depolarization. In contrast to the related potassium channel deficient model, Kv1.1-KO mice, spontaneous cortical spreading depolarizations in Kcnq2 cKO mice are tightly coupled to the terminal phase of seizures, arise bilaterally, and are observed predominantly during the dark phase. Administration of the non-selective Kv7.2 inhibitor XE991 to Kv1.1-KO mice partly reproduced the Kcnq2 cKO-like spreading depolarization phenotype (tight seizure coupling and bilateral symmetry) in these mice, indicating that Kv7.2 currents can directly and actively modulate spreading depolarization properties. In vitro brain slice studies confirmed that Kcnq2/Kv7.2 depletion or pharmacological inhibition intrinsically lowers the cortical spreading depolarization threshold, whereas pharmacological Kv7.2 activators elevate the threshold to multiple depolarizing and hypometabolic spreading depolarization triggers. Together these results identify Kcnq2/Kv7.2 as a distinctive spreading depolarization regulatory gene, and point to spreading depolarization as a potentially significant pathophysiological component of KCNQ2-linked epileptic encephalopathy syndromes. Our results also implicate KCNQ2/Kv7.2 channel activation as a potential adjunctive therapeutic target to inhibit spreading depolarization incidence.",

We report the clinical phenotypic spectrum of a founder NPRL3 pedigree (c.349delG, p.Glu117LysFS; n = 133) among Old Order Mennonites dating to 1727. Next, as a strategy to define the role of NPRL3 in cortical development, CRISPR/Cas9 Nprl3 knockout in Neuro2a cells in vitro and in fetal mouse brain in vivo was used to assess effects of Nprl3 knockout on mTOR activation, subcellular mTOR localization, nutrient signaling, cell morphology and aggregation, cerebral cortical cytoarchitecture, and network integrity. The NPRL3 pedigree exhibited an epilepsy penetrance of 28\% and heterogeneous clinical phenotypes with a range of epilepsy semiologies i.e., focal or generalized onset, brain imaging abnormalities i.e., polymicrogyria, focal cortical dysplasia, or normal imaging, and EEG findings, e.g., focal, multi-focal, or generalized spikes, focal or generalized slowing. Whole exome analysis comparing a seizure-free group (n = 37) to those with epilepsy (n = 24) to search for gene modifiers for epilepsy did not identify a unique genetic modifier that explained the variability in seizure penetrance in this cohort. Nprl3 knockout in vitro caused mTOR pathway hyperactivation, cell soma enlargement, and the formation of cellular aggregates seen in time-lapse videos that were prevented with the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin or torin1. In Nprl3 KO cells, mTOR remained localized on the lysosome in a constitutively active conformation, as evidenced by phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 proteins, even under nutrient starvation (amino acid free) conditions, demonstrating that Nprl3 loss decouples mTOR activation from neuronal metabolic state. To model human malformations of cortical development associated with NPRL3 variants, we created a focal Nprl3 KO in fetal mouse cortex by in utero electroporation and found altered cortical lamination and white matter heterotopic neurons, effects which were prevented with rapamycin treatment. EEG recordings showed network hyperexcitability and reduced seizure threshold to pentylenetetrazol treatment. NPRL3 variants are linked to a highly variable clinical phenotype which we propose result from mTOR-dependent effects on cell structure, cortical development, and network organization.",

One important uncertainty is to what extent thalamic subregions other than the ANT could be recruited more prominently in the propagation of focal onset seizures. We designed the current study to simultaneously monitor the engagement of the ANT, mediodorsal (MD) and pulvinar (PUL) nuclei during seizures in patients who could be candidates for thalamic neuromodulation. We studied 11 patients with clinical manifestations of presumed temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing invasive stereo-encephalography (sEEG) monitoring to confirm the source of their seizures. We extended cortical electrodes to reach the ANT, MD and PUL nuclei of the thalamus. More than one thalamic subdivision was simultaneously interrogated in nine patients. We recorded seizures with implanted electrodes across various regions of the brain and documented seizure onset zones (SOZ) in each recorded seizure. We visually identified the first thalamic subregion to be involved in seizure propagation. Additionally, in eight patients, we applied repeated single pulse electrical stimulation in each SOZ and recorded the time and prominence of evoked responses across the implanted thalamic regions. Our approach for multisite thalamic sampling was safe and caused no adverse events. Intracranial EEG recordings confirmed SOZ in medial temporal lobe, insula, orbitofrontal and temporal neocortical sites, highlighting the importance of invasive monitoring for accurate localization of SOZs. In all patients, seizures with the same propagation network and originating from the same SOZ involved the same thalamic subregion, with a stereotyped thalamic EEG signature. Qualitative visual reviews of ictal EEGs were largely consistent with the quantitative analysis of the corticothalamic evoked potentials, and both documented that thalamic nuclei other than ANT could have the earliest participation in seizure propagation. Specifically, pulvinar nuclei were involved earlier and more prominently than ANT in more than half of the patients. However, which specific thalamic subregion first demonstrated ictal activity could not be reliably predicted based on clinical semiology or lobar localization of SOZs. Our findings document the feasibility and safety of bilateral multisite sampling from the human thalamus. This may allow more personalized thalamic targets to be identified for neuromodulation. Future studies are needed to determine if a personalized thalamic neuromodulation leads to greater improvements in clinical outcome.",

It is still a matter for debate as to whether this lesion is acquired during the course of the patient's seizure history or is present at the outset. Early febrile seizures, episodes of status epilepticus as well as repetitive brief seizures may all contribute to the evolution of hippocampal sclerosis. In addition, genetic factors and developmental abnormalities of the hippocampus may both increase vulnerability to seizures and hippocampal injury. Recent human studies have addressed neuropathological changes in young adults and children undergoing surgery for refractory seizures with hippocampal sclerosis. Post-mortem examination, however, provides the opportunity to evaluate the effect of a lifetime of seizures on both left and right hippocampi, and the presence of any co-existing malformation. Post-mortem stereological analysis of 28 patients with poorly controlled seizures has confirmed a subgroup with absence of significant hippocampal neuronal loss despite decades of generalized seizures, including status epilepticus. The presence of granule cell dispersion correlated to the severity of hippocampal neuronal loss. Furthermore, in patients with confirmed hippocampal sclerosis at post-mortem examination, stereological assessment of the neocortex failed to confirm significant white matter neuronal heterotopia that might indicate an underlying developmental abnormality. In conclusion, seizures do not invariably lead to hippocampal injury and white matter heterotopia is not invariably associated with hippocampal sclerosis.",

abstract = "Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that the subiculum plays an important role in the maintenance of temporal lobe seizures. Using the pilocarpine-model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the present study examines the vulnerability of GABAergic subicular interneurons to recurrent seizures and determines its functional implications. In the subiculum of pilocarpine-treated animals, the density of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA-positive cells was reduced in all layers. Our data indicate a substantial loss of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the pyramidal cell and molecular layer whereas calretinin-immunoreactive cells were predominantly reduced in the molecular layer. Though the subiculum of pilocarpine-treated rats showed an increased intensity of GAD65 immunoreactivity, the density of GAD65 containing synaptic terminals in the pyramidal cell layer was decreased indicating an increase in the GAD65 intensity of surviving synaptic terminals. We observed a decrease in evoked inhibitory post-synaptic currents that mediate dendritic inhibition as well as a decline in the frequency of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) that are restricted to the perisomatic region. The decrease in mIPSC frequency (-30\%) matched with the reduced number of perisomatic GAD-positive terminals (-28\%) suggesting a decrease of pre-synaptic GABAergic input onto pyramidal cells in epileptic animals. Though cell loss in the subiculum has not been considered as a pathogenic factor in human and experimental TLE, our data suggest that the vulnerability of subicular GABAergic interneurons causes an input-specific disturbance of the subicular inhibitory system.",

We sought to determine the incidence and severity of ictal hypoxemia in patients with localization-related epilepsy undergoing in-patient video-EEG telemetry. We examined whether seizure-associated oxygen desaturation was a consequence of hypoventilation and whether factors such as seizure localization and lateralization, seizure duration, contralateral spread of seizures, patient position at seizure onset and body mass index influenced ictal-related hypoxemia. A total of 304 seizures with accompanying oxygen saturation data were recorded in 56 consecutive patients with intractable localization-related epilepsy; 51 of 304 seizures progressed to generalized convulsions. Pulse oximetry showed oxygen desaturations below 90\% in 101 (33.2\%) of all seizures with or without secondary generalization, with 31 (10.2\%) seizures accompanied by desaturations below 80\% and 11 (3.6\%) seizures below 70\%. The mean duration of desaturation below 90\% was 69.2 +/- 65.2 s (47; 6-327). The mean oxygen saturation nadir following secondary generalization was 75.4\% +/- 11.4\% (77\%; 42-100\%). Desaturations below 90\% were significantly correlated with seizure localization [P = 0.005; odds ratio (OR) of temporal versus extratemporal = 5.202; 95\% CI = (1.665, 16.257)], seizure lateralization [P = 0.001; OR of right versus left = 2.098; 95\% CI = (1.078, 4.085)], contralateral spread of seizures [P = 0.028; OR of contralateral spread versus no spread = 2.591; 95\% CI = (1.112, 6.039)] and gender [P = 0.048; OR of female versus male = 0.422; 95\% CI = (0.179, 0.994)]. In the subset of 253 partial seizures without secondary generalized convulsions, 34.8\% of seizures had desaturations below 90\%, 31.8\% had desaturations below 80\% and 12.5\% had desaturations below 70\%. The degree of desaturation was significantly correlated with seizure duration (P = 0.001) and with electrographic evidence of seizure spread to the contralateral hemisphere (P = 0.003). Central apnoeas or hypopnoeas occurred with 50\% of 100 seizures. Mixed or obstructive apnoeas occurred with 9\% of these seizures. End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) was recorded in seven patients (19 seizures). The mean increase in ETCO2 from preictal baseline was 18.6 +/- 17.7 mm Hg (13.2; 2.8-77.8). In these 19 seizures, all oxygen desaturations below 85\% were accompanied by an increase in ETCO2. Ictal hypoxemia occurs often in patients with localization-related epilepsy and may be pronounced and prolonged; even with seizures that do not progress to generalized convulsions. Oxygen desaturations are accompanied by increases in ETCO2, supporting the assumption that ictal oxygen desaturation is a consequence of hypoventilation. Ictal hypoxemia and hypercapnia may contribute to SUDEP.",

In patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, evaluation of preoperative verbal and visual memory function is important as anterior temporal lobe resections may result in material specific memory impairment, typically verbal memory decline following left and visual memory decline after right anterior temporal lobe resection. This study aimed to investigate reorganization of memory functions in temporal lobe epilepsy and to determine whether preoperative memory functional magnetic resonance imaging may predict memory changes following anterior temporal lobe resection. We studied 72 patients with unilateral medial temporal lobe epilepsy (41 left) and 20 healthy controls. A functional magnetic resonance imaging memory encoding paradigm for pictures, words and faces was used testing verbal and visual memory in a single scanning session on a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Fifty-four patients subsequently underwent left (29) or right (25) anterior temporal lobe resection. Verbal and design learning were assessed before and 4 months after surgery. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis revealed that in left temporal lobe epilepsy, greater left hippocampal activation for word encoding correlated with better verbal memory. In right temporal lobe epilepsy, greater right hippocampal activation for face encoding correlated with better visual memory. In left temporal lobe epilepsy, greater left than right anterior hippocampal activation on word encoding correlated with greater verbal memory decline after left anterior temporal lobe resection, while greater left than right posterior hippocampal activation correlated with better postoperative verbal memory outcome. In right temporal lobe epilepsy, greater right than left anterior hippocampal functional magnetic resonance imaging activation on face encoding predicted greater visual memory decline after right anterior temporal lobe resection, while greater right than left posterior hippocampal activation correlated with better visual memory outcome. Stepwise linear regression identified asymmetry of activation for encoding words and faces in the ipsilateral anterior medial temporal lobe as strongest predictors for postoperative verbal and visual memory decline. Activation asymmetry, language lateralization and performance on preoperative neuropsychological tests predicted clinically significant verbal memory decline in all patients who underwent left anterior temporal lobe resection, but were less able to predict visual memory decline after right anterior temporal lobe resection. Preoperative memory functional magnetic resonance imaging was the strongest predictor of verbal and visual memory decline following anterior temporal lobe resection. Preoperatively, verbal and visual memory function utilized the damaged, ipsilateral hippocampus and also the contralateral hippocampus. Memory function in the ipsilateral posterior hippocampus may contribute to better preservation of memory after surgery.",

'Early residents' (before 1972) were admitted for sheltered employment, escaping stigmatization, whereas 'later' residents with more severe epilepsies were admitted for care. Subjects admitted before 1972 were similar to subjects followed nowadays as outpatients, whereas patients admitted later with a higher burden of disabilities are often those in residential care. This long follow-up allowed exploration of a wide spectrum of epilepsies, affecting both subjects who were otherwise healthy and those with co-morbidities. Age at death showed a bimodal distribution with an early peak of mortality between 45-50 years old, whilst the remainder had life expectancy comparable to the general population. As a group, subjects who had post-mortem examination were not significantly different from patients who did not have post-mortem examination, but post-mortem examination provided data that were otherwise unavailable. For those who had post-mortem examination, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP, 18\% of all deaths) did not fully explain the early mortality, to which co-morbidities contributed. High seizure frequency was a significant independent predictor of early death even after excluding SUDEP (e.g. reduction in years of life for those who had >4 seizures/month compared with those who had <1 seizure/month: 13 years; 95\% confidence interval: 6-19; overall P = 0.0006). Those who survived to older age increasingly went into spontaneous remission lasting until death (in the whole cohort, 38/166, 23\% of those who died in or after sixth decade). In subjects who had post-mortem examination, older age (odds ratio = 1.13; 95\% confidence interval: 1.06-1.20) and presence of neuropathologically confirmed degenerative changes (that were not the cause of epilepsy) (odds ratio 7.14; 1.95-26.2) were independent predictors of terminal remission. Epilepsy may cause premature death indirectly through co-morbid conditions. Terminal remission occurs even without prior remissions; ageing may improve epilepsy drug responsiveness although unknown factors related to the natural history may also play a role.",

In this study we performed multiplex targeted sequencing of 10 genes in the PI3K/AKT pathway on brain tissue from 33 children who underwent surgical resection of dysplastic cortex for the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Sequencing results were correlated with clinical, imaging, pathological and immunohistological phenotypes. We identified mosaic activating mutations in PIK3CA and AKT3 in this cohort, including cancer-associated hotspot PIK3CA mutations in dysplastic megalencephaly, hemimegalencephaly, and focal cortical dysplasia type IIa. In addition, a germline PTEN mutation was identified in a male with hemimegalencephaly but no peripheral manifestations of the PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome. A spectrum of clinical, imaging and pathological abnormalities was found in this cohort. While patients with more severe brain imaging abnormalities and systemic manifestations were more likely to have detected mutations, routine histopathological studies did not predict mutation status. In addition, elevated levels of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein were identified in both neurons and astrocytes of all hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia type II specimens, regardless of the presence or absence of detected PI3K/AKT pathway mutations. In contrast, expression patterns of the T308 and S473 phosphorylated forms of AKT and in vitro AKT kinase activities discriminated between mutation-positive dysplasia cortex, mutation-negative dysplasia cortex, and non-dysplasia epilepsy cortex. Our findings identify PI3K/AKT pathway mutations as an important cause of epileptogenic brain malformations and establish megalencephaly, hemimegalencephaly, and focal cortical dysplasia as part of a single pathogenic spectrum.",

abstract = "Neurological and psychiatric syndromes often have multiple disease traits, yet it is unknown how such multi-faceted deficits arise from single mutations. Haploinsufficiency of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 causes Dravet syndrome, an intractable childhood-onset epilepsy with hyperactivity, cognitive deficit, autistic-like behaviours, and premature death. Deletion of Nav1.1 channels selectively impairs excitability of GABAergic interneurons. We studied mice having selective deletion of Nav1.1 in parvalbumin- or somatostatin-expressing interneurons. In brain slices, these deletions cause increased threshold for action potential generation, impaired action potential firing in trains, and reduced amplification of postsynaptic potentials in those interneurons. Selective deletion of Nav1.1 in parvalbumin- or somatostatin-expressing interneurons increases susceptibility to thermally-induced seizures, which are strikingly prolonged when Nav1.1 is deleted in both interneuron types. Mice with global haploinsufficiency of Nav1.1 display autistic-like behaviours, hyperactivity and cognitive impairment. Haploinsufficiency of Nav1.1 in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons causes autistic-like behaviours, but not hyperactivity, whereas haploinsufficiency in somatostatin-expressing interneurons causes hyperactivity without autistic-like behaviours. Heterozygous deletion in both interneuron types is required to impair long-term spatial memory in context-dependent fear conditioning, without affecting short-term spatial learning or memory. Thus, the multi-faceted phenotypes of Dravet syndrome can be genetically dissected, revealing synergy in causing epilepsy, premature death and deficits in long-term spatial memory, but interneuron-specific effects on hyperactivity and autistic-like behaviours. These results show that multiple disease traits can arise from similar functional deficits in specific interneuron types.",

abstract = "The majority of patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes triggered or provoked. Stress is the most frequently self-reported seizure-precipitant. The mechanisms underlying stress-sensitivity of seizures are currently unresolved. We hypothesized that stress-sensitivity of seizures relates to alteration of the stress response, which could affect neuronal excitability and hence trigger seizures. To study this, children with epilepsy between 6 and 17 years of age and healthy controls, with similar age, sex and intelligence, were exposed to a standardized acute psychosocial stressor (the Trier Social Stress Test for Children), during which salivary cortisol and sympathetic parameters were measured. Beforehand, the relation between stress and seizures in children with epilepsy was assessed by (i) a retrospective questionnaire; and (ii) a prospective 6-week diary on stress and seizure occurrence. Sixty-four children with epilepsy and 40 control subjects were included in the study. Of all children with epilepsy, 49\% reported that seizures were precipitated by acute stress. Diary analysis showed a positive association between acute stress and seizures in 62\% of children who experienced at least one seizure during the diary period. The acute social stress test was completed by 56 children with epilepsy and 37 control subjects. Children with sensitivity of seizures for acute stress, either determined by the questionnaire or by the prospective diary, showed a blunted cortisol response to stress compared with patients without acute stress-precipitated seizures and healthy controls (questionnaire-based F = 2.74, P = 0.018; diary-based F = 4.40, P = 0.007). No baseline differences in cortisol were observed, nor differences in sympathetic stress response. The relation between acute stress-sensitivity of seizures and the cortisol response to stress remained significant in multivariable analysis ($\beta$ = -0.30, P = 0.03). Other variables associated with the acute stress response were the number of anti-epileptic drugs ($\beta$ = -0.27, P = 0.05) and sleep quality ($\beta$ = 0.30, P = 0.03). In conclusion, we show that children with acute stress-sensitive seizures have a decreased cortisol response to stress. These results support our hypothesis that stress-sensitivity of seizures is associated with alterations of the stress response, thereby providing a first step in unravelling the mechanisms behind the seizure-precipitating effects of stress. Increased knowledge of the relation between stress and seizures in childhood epilepsy might benefit our understanding of the fundamental processes underlying epilepsy and ictogenesis in general, and provide valuable clues to direct the development of new therapeutic strategies for epilepsy.",

We aimed to assess whether structural changes potentially attributable to sudden death pathogenesis were present on magnetic resonance imaging in people who subsequently died of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. In a retrospective, voxel-based analysis of T1 volume scans, we compared grey matter volumes in 12 cases of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (two definite, 10 probable; eight males), acquired 2 years [median, interquartile range (IQR) 2.8] before death [median (IQR) age at scanning 33.5 (22) years], with 34 people at high risk [age 30.5 (12); 19 males], 19 at low risk [age 30 (7.5); 12 males] of sudden death, and 15 healthy controls [age 37 (16); seven males]. At-risk subjects were defined based on risk factors of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy identified in a recent combined risk factor analysis. We identified increased grey matter volume in the right anterior hippocampus/amygdala and parahippocampus in sudden death cases and people at high risk, when compared to those at low risk and controls. Compared to controls, posterior thalamic grey matter volume, an area mediating oxygen regulation, was reduced in cases of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and subjects at high risk. The extent of reduction correlated with disease duration in all subjects with epilepsy. Increased amygdalo-hippocampal grey matter volume with right-sided changes is consistent with histo-pathological findings reported in sudden infant death syndrome. We speculate that the right-sided predominance reflects asymmetric central influences on autonomic outflow, contributing to cardiac arrhythmia. Pulvinar damage may impair hypoxia regulation. The imaging findings in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and people at high risk may be useful as a biomarker for risk-stratification in future studies.",

We investigated the relationship between cortisol levels and the epileptiform discharges distinguishing persons with from those without stress-precipitated seizures (linear mixed model), and analysed the contribution of individual, epilepsy and recording characteristics with multivariable analysis. Twenty-nine recordings were performed in 21 individuals.

Epileptic seizures represent altered neuronal network dynamics, but the temporal evolution and cellular substrates of the neuronal activity patterns associated with spontaneous seizures are not fully understood. We used simultaneous recordings from multiple neurons in the hippocampus and neocortex of rats with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy to demonstrate that subsets of cells discharge in a highly stereotypical sequential pattern during ictal events, and that these stereotypical patterns were reproducible across consecutive seizures. In contrast to the canonical view that principal cell discharges dominate ictal events, the ictal sequences were predominantly composed of fast-spiking, putative inhibitory neurons, which displayed unusually strong coupling to local field potential even before seizures. The temporal evolution of activity was characterized by unique dynamics where the most correlated neuronal pairs before seizure onset displayed the largest increases in correlation strength during the seizures. These results demonstrate the selective involvement of fast spiking interneurons in structured temporal sequences during spontaneous ictal events in hippocampal and neocortical circuits in experimental models of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy.",

abstract = "Simultaneous scalp EEG/functional MRI measures non-invasively haemodynamic responses to interictal epileptic discharges, which are related to the epileptogenic zone. High frequency oscillations are also an excellent indicator of this zone, but are primarily recorded from intracerebral EEG. We studied the spatial overlap of these two important markers in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy to assess if their combination could help better define the extent of the epileptogenic zone. We included patients who underwent EEG-functional MRI and later intracerebral EEG. Based on intracerebral EEG findings, we separated patients with unifocal seizures from patients with multifocal or unknown onset seizures. Haemodynamic t-maps were coregistered with the intracerebral electrode positions. Each EEG channel was classified as pertaining to one of the following categories: primary haemodynamic cluster (maximum t-value), secondary cluster (t-value > 90\% of the primary cluster) or outside the primary and secondary clusters. We marked high frequency oscillations (ripples: 80-250 Hz; fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) during 1 h of slow wave sleep, and compared their rates in each haemodynamic category. After classifying channels as high- or low-rate, the proportion of high-rate channels within the primary or primary plus secondary clusters was compared to the proportion expected by chance. Twenty-five patients, 11 with unifocal and 14 with multifocal/unknown seizure onsets, were studied. We found a significantly higher median high frequency oscillation rate in the primary cluster compared to secondary cluster and outside these two clusters for the unifocal group (P < 0.0001), but not for the multifocal/unknown group. For the unifocal group, the number of high-rate channels within the primary or primary plus secondary clusters was significantly higher than expected by chance. This held only for the high-ripple-rate channels in the multifocal/unknown group. At the patient level, most patients (18/25, or 72\%) had at least one high-rate channel within a primary cluster. In patients with unifocal epilepsy, the maximum haemodynamic response (primary cluster) related to scalp interictal discharges overlaps with the tissue generating high frequency oscillations at high rates. If intracranial EEG is warranted, this response should be explored. As a tentative clinical use of the combination of these techniques we propose that higher high frequency oscillation rates inside than outside the maximum response indicates that the patient has indeed a focal epileptogenic zone demarcated by this response, whereas similar rates inside and outside may indicate a widespread epileptogenic zone or an epileptogenic zone not covered by the implantation.",

This multicentre study provides an atlas of normal intracranial EEG of the human brain during wakefulness. Here we present the results of power spectra analysis during wakefulness. Intracranial electrodes are placed in or on the brain of epilepsy patients when candidates for surgical treatment and non-invasive approaches failed to sufficiently localize the epileptic focus. Electrode contacts are usually in cortical regions showing epileptic activity, but some are placed in normal regions, at distance from the epileptogenic zone or lesion. Intracranial EEG channels defined using strict criteria as very likely to be in healthy brain regions were selected from three tertiary epilepsy centres. All contacts were localized in a common stereotactic space allowing the accumulation and superposition of results from many subjects. Sixty-second artefact-free sections during wakefulness were selected. Power spectra were calculated for 38 brain regions, and compared to a set of channels with no spectral peaks in order to identify significant peaks in the different regions. A total of 1785 channels with normal brain activity from 106 patients were identified. There were on average 2.7 channels per cm3 of cortical grey matter. The number of contacts per brain region averaged 47 (range 6-178). We found significant differences in the spectral density distributions across the different brain lobes, with beta activity in the frontal lobe (20-24 Hz), a clear alpha peak in the occipital lobe (9.25-10.25 Hz), intermediate alpha (8.25-9.25 Hz) and beta (17-20 Hz) frequencies in the parietal lobe, and lower alpha (7.75-8.25 Hz) and delta (0.75-2.25 Hz) peaks in the temporal lobe. Some cortical regions showed a specific electrophysiological signature: peaks present in >60\% of channels were found in the precentral gyrus (lateral: peak frequency range, 20-24 Hz; mesial: 24-30 Hz), opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus (20-24 Hz), cuneus (7.75-8.75 Hz), and hippocampus (0.75-1.25 Hz). Eight per cent of all analysed channels had more than one spectral peak; these channels were mostly recording from sensory and motor regions. Alpha activity was not present throughout the occipital lobe, and some cortical regions showed peaks in delta activity during wakefulness. This is the first atlas of normal intracranial EEG activity; it includes dense coverage of all cortical regions in a common stereotactic space, enabling direct comparisons of EEG across subjects.

One hypothesis proposes that sudden death is mediated by post-ictal central respiratory depression, which could relate to underlying pathology in key respiratory nuclei and/or their neuromodulators. Our aim was to investigate neuronal populations in the ventrolateral medulla (which includes the putative human pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex) and the medullary raphe. Forty brainstems were studied comprising four groups: 14 SUDEP, six epilepsy controls, seven Dravet syndrome cases and 13 non-epilepsy controls. Serial sections through the medulla (from obex 1 to 10 mm) were stained for Nissl, somatostatin, neurokinin 1 receptor (for pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex neurons) and galanin, tryptophan hydroxylase and serotonin transporter (neuromodulatory systems). Using stereology total neuronal number and densities, with respect to obex level, were measured. Whole slide scanning image analysis was used to quantify immunolabelling indices as well as co-localization between markers. Significant findings included reduction in somatostatin neurons and neurokinin 1 receptor labelling in the ventrolateral medulla in sudden death in epilepsy compared to controls (P < 0.05). Galanin and tryptophan hydroxylase labelling was also reduced in sudden death cases and more significantly in the ventrolateral medulla region than the raphe (P < 0.005 and P < 0.05). With serotonin transporter, reduction in labelling in cases of sudden death in epilepsy was noted only in the raphe (P $\leq$ 0.01); however, co-localization with tryptophan hydroxylase was significantly reduced in the ventrolateral medulla. Epilepsy controls and cases with Dravet syndrome showed less significant alterations with differences from non-epilepsy controls noted only for somatostatin in the ventrolateral medulla (P < 0.05). Variations in labelling with respect to obex level were noted of potential relevance to the rostro-caudal organization of respiratory nuclear groups, including tryptophan hydroxylase, where the greatest statistical difference noted between all epilepsy cases and controls was at obex 9-10 mm (P = 0.034), the putative level of the pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex. Furthermore, there was evidence for variation with duration of epilepsy for somatostatin and neurokinin 1 receptor. Our findings suggest alteration to neuronal populations in the medulla in SUDEP with evidence for greater reduction in neuromodulatory neuropeptidergic and mono-aminergic systems, including for galanin, and serotonin. Other nuclei need to be investigated to evaluate if this is part of more widespread brainstem pathology. Our findings could be a result of previous seizures and may represent a pathological risk factor for SUDEP through impaired respiratory homeostasis during a seizure.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a fatal complication of epilepsy in which brainstem spreading depolarization may play a pivotal role, as suggested by animal studies. However, patiotemporal details of spreading depolarization occurring in relation to fatal seizures have not been investigated. In addition, little is known about behavioural and neurophysiological features that may discriminate spontaneous fatal from non-fatal seizures. Transgenic mice carrying the missense mutation S218L in the $\alpha$1A subunit of Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca2+ channels exhibit enhanced excitatory neurotransmission and increased susceptibility to spreading depolarization. Homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice show spontaneous non-fatal and fatal seizures, occurring throughout life, resulting in reduced life expectancy. To identify characteristics of fatal and non-fatal spontaneous seizures, we compared behavioural and electrophysiological seizure dynamics in freely-behaving homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice. To gain insight on the role of brainstem spreading depolarization in SUDEP, we studied the spatiotemporal distribution of spreading depolarization in the context of seizure-related death. Spontaneous and electrically-induced seizures were investigated by video monitoring and electrophysiological recordings in freely-behaving Cacna1aS218L and wild-type mice. Homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice showed multiple spontaneous tonic-clonic seizures and died from SUDEP in adulthood. Death was preceded by a tonic-clonic seizure terminating with hindlimb clonus, with suppression of cortical neuronal activity during and after the seizure. Induced seizures in freely-behaving homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice were followed by multiple spreading depolarizations and death. In wild-type or heterozygous Cacna1aS218L mice, induced seizures and spreading depolarization were never followed by death. To identify temporal and regional features of seizure-induced spreading depolarization related to fatal outcome, diffusion-weighted MRI was performed in anaesthetized homozygous Cacna1aS218L and wild-type mice. In homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice, appearance of seizure-related spreading depolarization in the brainstem correlated with respiratory arrest that was followed by cardiac arrest and death. Recordings in freely-behaving homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice confirmed brainstem spreading depolarization during spontaneous fatal seizures. These data underscore the value of the homozygous Cacna1aS218L mouse model for identifying discriminative features of fatal compared to non-fatal seizures, and support a key role for cortical neuronal suppression and brainstem spreading depolarization in SUDEP pathophysiology.",

We examined these pathways, as well as amyloid-$\beta$ and tau pathologies in the hippocampus and temporal lobe cortex of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients who underwent temporal lobe resection (n = 19), in comparison with age- and region-matched samples from neurologically normal autopsy cases (n = 22). Post-mortem temporal cortex samples from Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 9) were used as positive controls to validate many of the neurodegeneration-related antibodies. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis of tissue from temporal lobe epilepsy cases revealed increased phosphorylation of full-length amyloid precursor protein and its associated neurotoxic cleavage product amyloid-$\beta$*56. Pathological phosphorylation of two distinct tau species was also increased in both regions, but increases in amyloid-$\beta$1-42 peptide, the main component of amyloid plaques, were restricted to the hippocampus. Furthermore, several major stress kinases involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology were significantly activated in temporal lobe epilepsy brain samples, including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase. In temporal lobe epilepsy cases, hippocampal levels of phosphorylated amyloid precursor protein, its pro-amyloidogenic processing enzyme beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and both total and hyperphosphorylated tau expression, correlated with impaired preoperative executive function. Our study suggests that neurodegenerative and stress-related processes common to those observed in Alzheimer's disease may contribute to cognitive impairment in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. In particular, we identified several stress pathways that may represent potential novel therapeutic targets.",

abstract = "Postictal generalized EEG suppression is the state of suppression of electrical activity at the end of a seizure. Prolongation of this state has been associated with increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, making characterization of underlying electrical rhythmic activity during postictal suppression an important step in improving epilepsy treatment. Phase-amplitude coupling in EEG reflects cognitive coding within brain networks and some of those codes highlight epileptic activity; therefore, we hypothesized that there are distinct phase-amplitude coupling features in the postictal suppression state that can provide an improved estimate of this state in the context of patient risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We used both intracranial and scalp EEG data from eleven patients (six male, five female; age range 21-41 years) containing 25 seizures, to identify frequency dynamics, both in the ictal and postictal EEG suppression states. Cross-frequency coupling analysis identified that during seizures there was a gradual decrease of phase frequency in the coupling between delta (0.5-4 Hz) and gamma (30+ Hz), which was followed by an increased coupling between the phase of 0.5-1.5 Hz signal and amplitude of 30-50 Hz signal in the postictal state as compared to the pre-seizure baseline. This marker was consistent across patients. Then, using these postictal-specific features, an unsupervised state classifier-a hidden Markov model-was able to reliably classify four distinct states of seizure episodes, including a postictal suppression state. Furthermore, a connectome analysis of the postictal suppression states showed increased information flow within the network during postictal suppression states as compared to the pre-seizure baseline, suggesting enhanced network communication. When the same tools were applied to the EEG of an epilepsy patient who died unexpectedly, ictal coupling dynamics disappeared and postictal phase-amplitude coupling remained constant throughout. Overall, our findings suggest that there are active postictal networks, as defined through coupling dynamics that can be used to objectively classify the postictal suppression state; furthermore, in a case study of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, the network does not show ictal-like phase-amplitude coupling features despite the presence of convulsive seizures, and instead demonstrates activity similar to postictal. The postictal suppression state is a period of elevated network activity as compared to the baseline activity which can provide key insights into the epileptic pathology.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is the leading category of epilepsy-related death and the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Risk factors can include a recent history and high frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which can depress brain activity postictally, impairing respiration, arousal and protective reflexes. Neuropathological findings in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy cases parallel those in other epilepsy patients, with no implication of novel structures or mechanisms in seizure-related deaths. Few large studies have comprehensively reviewed whole brain examination of such patients. We evaluated 92 North American Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy Registry cases with whole brain neuropathological examination by board-certified neuropathologists blinded to the adjudicated cause of death, with an average of 16 brain regions examined per case. The 92 cases included 61 sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (40 definite, 9 definite plus, 6 probable, 6 possible) and 31 people with epilepsy controls who died from other causes. The mean age at death was 34.4 years and 65.2\% (60/92) were male. The average age of death was younger for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy cases than for epilepsy controls (30.0 versus 39.6 years; P = 0.006), and there was no difference in sex distribution respectively (67.3\% male versus 64.5\%, P = 0.8). Among sudden unexpected death in epilepsy cases, earlier age of epilepsy onset positively correlated with a younger age at death (P = 0.0005) and negatively correlated with epilepsy duration (P = 0.001). Neuropathological findings were identified in 83.7\% of the cases in our cohort. The most common findings were dentate gyrus dysgenesis (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy 50.9\%, epilepsy controls 54.8\%) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy 41.8\%, epilepsy controls 29.0\%). The neuropathological findings in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy paralleled those in epilepsy controls, including the frequency of total neuropathological findings as well as the specific findings in the dentate gyrus, findings pertaining to neurodevelopment (e.g. FCD, heterotopias) and findings in the brainstem (e.g. medullary arcuate or olivary dysgenesis). Thus, like prior studies, we found no neuropathological findings that were more common in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy cases. Future neuropathological studies evaluating larger sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and control cohorts would benefit from inclusion of different epilepsy syndromes with detailed phenotypic information, consensus among pathologists particularly for more subjective findings where observations can be inconsistent, and molecular approaches to identify markers of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy risk or pathogenesis.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is the leading cause of epilepsy related death. Currently, there are no reliable methods for preventing sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. The precise pathophysiology of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is unclear; however, convergent lines of evidence suggest that seizure-induced respiratory arrest plays a central role. It is generally agreed that sudden unexpected death in epilepsy could be averted if the patient could be rapidly ventilated following the seizure. The diaphragm is a muscle in the chest which contracts to draw air into the lungs. Diaphragmatic pacing is a surgical intervention which facilitates normal ventilation in situations, such as spinal cord injury and sleep apnoea, in which endogenous respiration would be inadequate or non-existent. In diaphragmatic pacing, electrodes are implanted directly onto diaphragm or adjacent to the phrenic nerves which innervate the diaphragm. These electrodes are then rhythmically stimulated, thereby eliciting contractions of the diaphragm which emulate endogenous breathing. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that seizure-induced respiratory arrest and death can be prevented with diaphragmatic pacing. Our approach was to induce respiratory arrest using maximal electroshock seizures in adult, male, C57BL6 mice outfitted with EEG and diaphragmatic electrodes (n = 8 mice). In the experimental group, the diaphragm was stimulated to exogenously induce breathing. In the control group, no stimulation was applied. Breathing and cortical electrographic activity were monitored using whole body plethysmography and EEG, respectively. A majority of the animals that did not receive the diaphragmatic pacing intervention died of seizure-induced respiratory arrest. Conversely, none of the animals that received the diaphragmatic pacing intervention died. Diaphragmatic pacing improved postictal respiratory outcomes (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.001) and reduced the likelyhood of seizure-induced death (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.026). Unexpectedly, diaphragmatic pacing did not instantly restore breathing during the postictal period, potentially indicating peripheral airway occlusion by laryngospasm. All diaphragmatically paced animals breathed at some point during the pacing stimulation. Two animals took their first breath prior to the onset of pacing and some animals had significant apnoeas after the pacing stimulation. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy results in more years of potential life lost than any other neurological condition with the exception of stroke. By demonstrating that seizure-induced respiratory arrest can be prevented by transient diaphragmatic pacing in animal models we hope to inform the development of closed-loop systems capable of detecting and preventing sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",

abstract = "Epileptic activity in genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) patients preferentially appears during sleep and its mechanism remains unknown. Here, we found that sleep-like slow-wave oscillations (0.5 Hz SWOs) potentiated excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in layer V cortical pyramidal neurons from wild-type (wt) mouse brain slices. In contrast, SWOs potentiated excitatory, but not inhibitory, currents in cortical neurons from a heterozygous (het) knock-in (KI) Gabrg2+Q/390X model of Dravet epilepsy syndrome. This created an imbalance between evoked excitatory and inhibitory currents to effectively prompt neuronal action potential firings. Similarly, physiologically similar up-/down-state induction (present during slow-wave sleep) in cortical neurons also potentiated excitatory synaptic currents within brain slices from wt and het KI mice. Moreover, this state-dependent potentiation of excitatory synaptic currents entailed some signaling pathways of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Consequently, in het KI mice, in vivo SWO induction (using optogenetic methods) triggered generalized epileptic spike-wave discharges (SWDs), being accompanied by sudden immobility, facial myoclonus, and vibrissa twitching. In contrast, in wt littermates, SWO induction did not cause epileptic SWDs and motor behaviors. To our knowledge, this is the first mechanism to explain why epileptic SWDs preferentially happen during non rapid eye-movement sleep and quiet-wakefulness in human GGE patients.",

abstract = "Spike timing precision is a fundamental aspect of neuronal information processing in the brain. Here we examined the temporal precision of input-output operation of dentate granule cells (DGCs) in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In TLE, mossy fibers sprout and establish recurrent synapses on DGCs that generate aberrant slow kainate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP(KA)) not observed in controls. We report that, in contrast to time-locked spikes generated by EPSP(AMPA) in control DGCs, aberrant EPSP(KA) are associated with long-lasting plateaus and jittered spikes during single-spike mode firing. This is mediated by a selective voltage-dependent amplification of EPSP(KA) through persistent sodium current (I(NaP)) activation. In control DGCs, a current injection of a waveform mimicking the slow shape of EPSP(KA) activates I(NaP) and generates jittered spikes. Conversely in epileptic rats, blockade of EPSP(KA) or I(NaP) restores the temporal precision of EPSP-spike coupling. Importantly, EPSP(KA) not only decrease spike timing precision at recurrent mossy fiber synapses but also at perforant path synapses during synaptic integration through I(NaP) activation. We conclude that a selective interplay between aberrant EPSP(KA) and I(NaP) severely alters the temporal precision of EPSP-spike coupling in DGCs of chronic epileptic rats.",

Previous studies in Scn1a(-/+) mice during the pre-epileptic period reported selective reduction in interneuron excitability and proposed this as the main pathological mechanism underlying SMEI. Yet, the functional consequences of this interneuronal dysfunction at the circuit level in vivo are unknown. Here, we investigated whether Scn1a(-/+) mice showed alterations in cortical network function. We found that various forms of spontaneous network activity were similar in Scn1a(-/+) during the pre-epileptic period compared with wild-type (WT) in vivo. Importantly, in brain slices from Scn1a(-/+) mice, the excitability of parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) interneurons was reduced, epileptiform activity propagated more rapidly, and complex synaptic changes were observed. However, in vivo, optogenetic reduction of firing in PV or SST cells in WT mice modified ongoing network activities, and juxtasomal recordings from identified PV and SST interneurons showed unaffected interneuronal firing during spontaneous cortical dynamics in Scn1a(-/+) compared with WT. These results demonstrate that interneuronal hypoexcitability is not observed in Scn1a(-/+) mice during spontaneous activities in vivo and suggest that additional mechanisms may contribute to homeostatic rearrangements and the pathogenesis of SMEI.",

Epilepsies due to DEPDC5 mutations are often associated with brain malformations, tend to be drug-resistant, and have been linked to an increased risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Generation of epilepsy models to define mechanisms of epileptogenesis remains vital for future therapies. Here, we describe a novel mouse model of Depdc5 deficiency with a severe epilepsy phenotype, generated by conditional deletion of Depdc5 in dorsal telencephalic neuroprogenitor cells. In contrast to control and heterozygous mice, Depdc5-Emx1-Cre conditional knockout (CKO) mice demonstrated macrocephaly, spontaneous seizures, and premature death. Consistent with increased mTORC1 activation, targeted neurons were enlarged, and both neurons and astrocytes demonstrated increased S6 phosphorylation. Electrophysiologic characterization of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in excitatory neurons was consistent with impaired post-synaptic response to GABAergic input, suggesting a potential mechanism for neuronal hyperexcitability. mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin significantly improved survival of CKO animals and prevented observed seizures, including for up to forty days following rapamycin withdrawal. These data not only support a primary role for mTORC1 hyperactivation in epilepsy following homozygous loss of Depdc5, but also suggest a developmental window for treatment which may have a durable benefit for some time even after withdrawal.",

Animal models recapitulating the clinical features of patients are essential to decipher GATORopathy. Although several genetically modified animal models recapitulate DEPDC5-related epilepsy, no models have been reported for NPRL2- or NPRL3-related epilepsies.

abstract = "A mutation in the voltage-gated sodium-channel Scn2a results in moderate epilepsy in transgenic Scn2aQ54 mice maintained on a C57BL/6J strain background. The onset of progressive epilepsy begins in adults with short-duration partial seizures that originate in the hippocampus. The underlying abnormality is an increase in persistent sodium current in hippocampal neurons. The voltage-gated potassium channel Kcnq2 is responsible for generating M current (IKM) that is thought to control excitability and limit repetitive firing of hippocampal neurons. To determine whether impaired M current would exacerbate the seizure phenotype of Scn2aQ54 mice, we carried out genetic crosses with two mutant alleles of Kcnq2. Szt1 mice carry a spontaneous deletion that removes the C-terminal domain of Kcnq2. A novel Kcnq2 missense mutation V182M was identified by screening the offspring of ENU-treated males for reduced threshold to electrically evoked minimal clonic seizures. Double mutant mice carrying the Scn2aQ54 transgene together with either of the Kcnq2 mutations exhibited severe epilepsy with early onset, generalized tonic--clonic seizures and juvenile lethality by 3 weeks of age. This dramatic exacerbation of the sodium-channel mutant phenotype indicates that M current plays a critical role in preventing seizure initiation and spreading in this animal model. The genetic interaction between Scn2a and Kcnq2 demonstrates that combinations of mild alleles of monogenic epilepsy genes can result in severe disease and provides a model for complex inheritance of human epilepsy. The data suggest that interaction between these genes might contribute to the variable expressivity observed in human families with sodium-channel mutations. In a screen of 23 SMEI patients with missense mutations of SCN1A, no second-site mutations in KCNQ2 were identified.",

author = "Carson, Robert P and Fu, Cary and Winzenburger, Peggy and Ess, Kevin C",
abstract = "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2 signaling is impaired in the brain, whereas mTORC1 signaling is unchanged. Rictor CKO mice have small brains and bodies, normal lifespan and are fertile. Cortical layering is normal, but neurons are smaller than those in control brains. Seizures were not observed, although excessive slow activity was seen on electroencephalography. Rictor CKO mice are hyperactive and have reduced anxiety-like behavior. Finally, there is decreased white matter and increased levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the cerebral cortex. Loss of mTORC2 signaling in the cortex independent of mTORC1 can disrupt normal brain development and function and may contribute to some of the neurologic manifestations seen in TSC.",

abstract = "De novo mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN8A have recently been recognized as a cause of epileptic encephalopathy, which is characterized by refractory seizures with developmental delay and cognitive disability. We previously described the heterozygous SCN8A missense mutation p.Asn1768Asp in a child with epileptic encephalopathy that included seizures, ataxia, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The mutation results in increased persistent sodium current and hyperactivity of transfected neurons. We have characterized a knock-in mouse model expressing this dominant gain-of-function mutation to investigate the pathology of the altered channel in vivo. The mutant channel protein is stable in vivo. Heterozygous Scn8a(N1768D/+) mice exhibit seizures and SUDEP, confirming the causality of the de novo mutation in the proband. Using video/EEG analysis, we detect ictal discharges that coincide with convulsive seizures and myoclonic jerks. Prior to seizure onset, heterozygous mutants are not defective in motor learning or fear conditioning, but do exhibit mild impairment of motor coordination and social discrimination. Homozygous mutant mice exhibit earlier seizure onset than heterozygotes and more rapid progression to death. Analysis of the intermediate phenotype of functionally hemizygous Scn8a(N1768D/-) mice indicates that severity is increased by a double dose of mutant protein and reduced by the presence of wild-type protein. Scn8a(N1768D) mutant mice provide a model of epileptic encephalopathy that will be valuable for studying the in vivo effects of hyperactive Nav1.6 and the response to therapeutic interventions.",

abstract = "People with epilepsy have greatly increased probability of premature mortality due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Identifying which patients are most at risk of SUDEP is hindered by a complex genetic etiology, incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, and lack of prognostic biomarkers. Here we evaluated heterozygous Scn2a gene deletion (Scn2a+/-) as a protective genetic modifier in the Kcna1 knockout mouse (Kcna1-/-) model of SUDEP, while searching for biomarkers of SUDEP risk embedded in electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. The human epilepsy gene Kcna1 encodes voltage-gated Kv1.1 potassium channels that act to dampen neuronal excitability whereas Scn2a encodes voltage-gated Nav1.2 sodium channels important for action potential initiation and conduction. SUDEP-prone Kcna1-/- mice with partial genetic ablation of Nav1.2 channels (i.e., Scn2a+/-; Kcna1-/-) exhibited a two-fold increase in survival. Classical analysis of EEG and ECG recordings separately showed significantly decreased seizure durations in Scn2a+/-; Kcna1-/- mice compared to Kcna1-/- mice, without substantial modification of cardiac abnormalities. Novel analysis of the EEG and ECG together revealed a significant reduction in EEG-ECG association in Kcna1-/- mice compared to wild types, which was partially restored in Scn2a+/-; Kcna1-/- mice. The degree of EEG-ECG association was also proportional to the survival rate of mice across genotypes. These results show that Scn2a gene deletion acts as protective genetic modifier of SUDEP and suggest measures of brain-heart association as potential indices of SUDEP susceptibility.",

abstract = "DEPDC5 is now recognized as one of the genes most often implicated in familial/inherited focal epilepsy and brain malformations. Individuals with pathogenic variants in DEPDC5 are at risk for epilepsy, associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities, and Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Depdc5flox/flox-Syn1Cre (Depdc5cc+) neuronal-specific Depdc5 knockout mice exhibit seizures and neuronal mTORC1 hyperactivation. It is not known if Depdc5cc+ mice have a hyperactivity/anxiety phenotype, die early from terminal seizures, or whether mTOR inhibitors rescue DEPDC5-related seizures and associated comorbidities. Herein, we report that Depdc5cc+ mice were hyperactive in open-field testing but did not display anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated-plus maze. Unlike many other mTOR-related models, Depdc5cc+ mice had minimal epileptiform activity and rare seizures prior to seizure-induced death, as confirmed by video-EEG monitoring. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin starting after 3 weeks of age significantly prolonged the survival of Depdc5cc+ mice and partially rescued the behavioral hyperactivity. Rapamycin decreased the enlarged brain size of Depdc5cc+ mice with corresponding decrease in neuronal soma size. Loss of Depdc5 led to a decrease in the other GATOR1 protein levels (NPRL2 and NPRL3). Rapamycin failed to rescue GATOR1 protein levels but rather rescued downstream mTORC1 hyperactivity as measured by phosphorylation of S6. Collectively, our data provide the first evidence of behavioral alterations in mice with Depdc5 loss and support mTOR inhibition as a rational therapeutic strategy for DEPDC5-related epilepsy in humans.",

Here, we describe TDP-43 neuropathology in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and adjacent nuclei in 98 individuals (mean age, 86 years; median final mini-mental state examination score, 27). On examination blinded to clinical and pathologic diagnoses, we identified TDP-43 pathology that most frequently involved the ventromedial basal forebrain in 19 individuals (19.4\%). As expected, many of these brains had comorbid pathologies including those of Alzheimer disease (AD), Lewy body disease (LBD), and/or hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging). The basal forebrain TDP-43 pathology was strongly associated with comorbid HS-Aging (odds ratio = 6.8, p = 0.001), whereas there was no significant association between basal forebrain TDP-43 pathology and either AD or LBD neuropathology. In this sample, there were some cases with apparent preclinical TDP-43 pathology in the basal forebrain that may indicate that this is an early affected area in HS-Aging. We conclude that TDP-43 pathology in the basal forebrain is strongly associated with HS-Aging. These results raise questions about a specific pathogenetic relationship between basal forebrain TDP-43 and non-HS-Aging comorbid diseases (AD and LBD).",

Our separate studies of SIDS and SUDC provide evidence of shared hippocampal abnormalities, specifically focal dentate bilamination, a lesion classically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy, across the 2 groups. In this study, we characterized the clinicopathologic features in a retrospective case series of 32 children with sudden death and hippocampal formation (HF) maldevelopment. The greatest frequency of deaths was between 3 weeks and 3 years (81\%, 26/32). Dentate anomalies were found across the pediatric age spectrum, supporting a common vulnerability that defies the 1-year age cutoff between SIDS and SUDC. Twelve cases (38\%) had seizures, including 7 only with febrile seizures. Subicular anomalies were found in cases over 1 year of age and were associated with increased risk of febrile seizures. Sudden death associated with HF maldevelopment reflects a complex interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that lead to death at different pediatric ages, and may be analogous to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.",

OBJECTIVE: To make initial progress in the development of network analysis methods to identify epileptogenic brain regions using brief, resting-state SEEG data segments, without requiring seizure recordings. METHODS: In a cohort of 15 adult focal epilepsy patients undergoing SEEG, we evaluated functional connectivity (alpha-band imaginary coherence) across sampled regions using brief (2 min) resting-state data segments. Bootstrapped logistic regression was used to generate a model to predict epileptogenicity of individual regions. RESULTS: Compared to nonepileptogenic structures, we found increased functional connectivity within epileptogenic regions (P < .05) and between epileptogenic areas and other structures (P < .01, paired t-tests, corrected). Epileptogenic areas also demonstrated higher clustering coefficient (P < .01) and betweenness centrality (P < .01), and greater decay of functional connectivity with distance (P < .05, paired t-tests, corrected). Our functional connectivity model to predict epileptogenicity of individual regions demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.78 and accuracy of 80.4\%. CONCLUSION: Our study represents a preliminary step towards defining resting-state SEEG functional connectivity patterns to help localize epileptogenic brain regions ahead of neurosurgical treatment without requiring seizure recordings.",

Furthermore, although an influential theory posits that connectivity between the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important in initiating the response to sustained or uncertain threat, whether individual differences in conservatism modulate this connectivity is unknown. To test whether conservatism is associated with increased reactivity in neural threat circuitry, we measured participants' self-reported social and economic conservatism and asked them to complete high-resolution fMRI scans while under threat of an unpredictable shock and while safe. We found that economic conservatism predicted greater connectivity between the BNST and a cluster of voxels in the left amygdala during threat vs safety.

These factors are often intertwined. For example, greater BNST (vs. CM) activation during a block of aversive stimuli may reflect either more sustained activation to the stimuli, or greater activation due to the anticipation of upcoming stimuli. To further investigate these questions, we had participants (19 females, 9 males) complete a task adapted from Somerville et al. (2013) during high-resolution 7-Tesla fMRI BOLD acquisition. We found a larger response to negative vs. neutral blocks (sustained threat) than to images (transient) in the BNST, but not the CM. However, in an additional analysis, we also found BNST, but not CM, activation to the onset of the anticipation period on negative vs. neutral trials, possibly contributing to BNST activation across negative blocks. Predictability did not affect CM or BNST activation. These results suggest a BNST role in anxious anticipation and highlight the need for further research clarifying the temporal response characteristics of these regions.",

abstract = "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Clinical and experimental observations argue that sleep disturbances are common and coexist in patients with epilepsy. Our previous observations have suggested that neural-immune interactions between corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are involved in the regulation of physiological sleep-wake behavior. In the present study, we determined the involvement of CRH and IL-1 in the alteration of sleep-wake activities in rats when amygdala kindling was given either at the beginning of the light period (light-onset kindling) or at the beginning of the dark period (dark-onset kindling). DESIGN: The analysis of sleep-wake activities was performed before and after full-blown kindling, and the actions of CRH and IL-1 were tested by pharmacological blockade. SETTING: Neuroscience Laboratory at China Medical University Hospital. PARTICIPANT AND INTERVENTIONS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes and an intracerebroventricular (ICV) guide cannula. Kindling stimuli delivered via a bipolar electrode placing in the right central nucleus of the amygdala. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Amygdala kindling induced diverse effects on sleep. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreased during the first 12-hour light period when rats were kindled at light onset. When dark-onset kindling was given, SWS increased but REM sleep was not altered during the first 12-hour dark period. After light-onset kindling, the circulating corticosterone concentrations increased and were blocked by ICV administration of the CRH receptor antagonist, astressin or alpha-hCRH. The ICV administration of the CRH antagonist blocked the light-onset kindling-induced decrease of SWS in a dose-dependent manner. After dark-onset kindling, IL-1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus and cortex increased. The dark-onset kindling-induced SWS was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by ICV administration of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 ra). The slow-wave activity during SWS was enhanced regardless of when kindling occurred, but both CRH antagonists and IL-1 ra had little effect on the alteration of slow-wave activity. CONCLUSION: These observations argue that amygdala-kindling-induced sleep-wake alterations are modulated by central increases in CRH or IL-1.",

author = "Bravo, Eduardo and Marincovich, Anthony and Teran, Frida and Crotts, Megan and Lefkowitz, Robert J and Richerson, George",
abstract = "Rationale SUDEP is the most common cause of death in refractory epilepsy patients. The MORTality in Epilepsy Monitoring Unit Study (MORTEMUS) reported monitored SUDEP cases, and fatal apnea preceded terminal asystole in all patients. The mechanisms involved in seizure-induced apnea are not known, but evidence suggests the amygdala may be a critical node in the pathway by which seizures spread from the forebrain to the brainstem respiratory network. Depth electrode recordings from the amygdala of epilepsy patients showed that prolonged apneas occur when seizures spread into the CeA. Apneas also occur when the CeA is electrically stimulated in awake patients. Here we examined the role of the amygdala in peri-ictal apnea and its involvement in SUDEP in two epilepsy models: Scn1aR1407X/+ (Dravet Syndrome; DS) mice and DBA/1 mice. Methods Baseline breathing, hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) and hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) were assessed using whole-body plethysmography in DS (n=7) and DBA/1 (n=8) mice before and after lesioning the CeA. Under surgical anesthesia (1?2\% isoflurane), electrolytic lesions were induced in the CeA, after which mice were instrumented with EEG, ECG and EMG electrodes. After 5 days of recovery, mice were tethered to a preamplifier and placed in a plethysmography chamber. Seizures were induced in DS mice (n=22) by increasing body temperature 0.5°C per minute using a heat lamp and in DBA/1 mice (n=13) with loud white noise. In a separate cohort of DS mice (n=4), the CeA was stimulated under light anesthesia (0.5?1\% isoflurane) by injecting current with stereotactically guided monopolar electrodes while measuring breathing using head-out plethysmography. Electrode placement was verified post hoc using histology. In a third cohort of DS mice (n=12), CeA lesions or sham lesions were made and mice were video-monitored for 100 days. A subset of these mice had spontaneous seizures and SUDEP. Results CeA lesions did not affect baseline breathing, HCVR or HVR, and did not prevent seizures in DS or DBA/1 mice. Apnea and death occurred in control (sham-lesioned) DS mice following heat-induced seizures in 54.4\% of cases (n=11). In contrast, only 9.1\% of DS mice with CeA lesions showed respiratory arrest and death after heat-induced seizures (n=11; p=0.016). Stimulation of the rostral CeA produced apnea that was dependent on the frequency and amplitude of stimulation, without causing seizures. At 50 Hz and 500 ?A, apnea was induced for 1?4 minutes without causing death (n=4) or reversal of anesthetic immobility, suggesting lack of an arousal response. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that mice with CeA lesions had higher survival (64.5\%) than sham lesions (28.3\%) (p=0.015). Conclusion Our data suggest that the CeA can induce apnea but, is not directly involved in baseline respiratory rhythm generation or the ventilatory response to hypercapnia or hypoxia. CeA lesions reduce the risk of apnea during seizures. Therefore, the CeA is a key component of the neural pathway through which seizures spread from the forebrain to respiratory centers in the brainstem to elicit ventilatory arrest after seizures.

author = "Bravo, Eduardo and Teran, Frida and Crotts, Megan and Dlouhy, Brian and Richerson, George",
abstract = "Automatic control of breathing is mediated by a neural network in the brainstem, modulated by central and peripheral inputs. A major source of this modulation comes from chemoreceptors from peripheral and central level. In addition, automatic control of breathing can be overridden by voluntary or conscious control. Pathways involved in this conscious control may be usurped by seizures, resulting in ictal apnea, at the same time that chemoreceptor drive is impaired. Here we studied mechanisms by which the limbic system might modulate breathing, and how this may lead to fatal apnea induced by a seizure. We used Scn1aR1407X/+ mice, a genetic mouse model of Dravet Syndrome (DS) and SUDEP, to study how activation of the Central Amygdala (CeA) can modify breathing and induce fatal apneas. Methods In DS mice (n=4), the CeA was stimulated under light anesthesia by injecting current with monopolar electrodes guided by a stereotaxic manipulator while measuring breathing using head-out plethysmography. The locations of the electrode were verified post hoc by electrolytic lesion and histology. A 3D map was generated of the portions of the CeA where breathing was modulated. In a separate group of DS (n=7) mice, whole-body plethysmography was used to assess baseline breathing, the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) and the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) before and after lesioning the CeA. In a third group of DS mice (n=11), electrolytic lesions were induced in the CeA. Mice were then instrumented with headmounts with EEG, ECG and EMG electrodes. After 5 days of recovery, headmounts were connected to a preamplifier and a commutator, and mice were placed in a plethysmography chamber to monitor breathing as well as EEG, ECG and EMG activity. Body temperature was increased with a heat lamp by 0.5°C per minute until a seizure was induced, or a maximum of 42.5°C was reached. Results CeA lesions did not affect baseline breathing, the HCVR or HVR, and did not prevent seizures in DS mice. Respiratory arrest and death occurred in control (sham-lesioned) DS mice following heat-induced seizures in 54.4\% of cases (n=11). In contrast, only 9.1\% of DS mice with CeA lesions showed ventilatory arrest and death after heat-induced seizures (n=11; p=0.016). Unilateral rostral amygdala lesions increased the survival rate from spontaneous seizures in DS mice (26.10\% vs 49.12.5\%, n=14 control, n=20 lesioned p=0.022). Stimulation of the rostral CeA produced apnea without causing seizures. Complete apnea could be induced for 1 minute without causing death in three animals, and for four minutes in one animal. Breathing returned immediately upon termination of amygdala stimulation in each case. There was also no reversal of anesthetic immobility, suggesting lack of an arousal response. Conclusions Our data suggest that the CeA modulates breathing and can induce complete apnea but is not directly involved in baseline respiratory rhythm generation or the ventilatory response to hypercapnia or hypoxia. Lesions of the CeA reduce the risk of apnea during seizures. We conclude that the CeA is a critical component of the neural pathway responsible for spread of seizures in the forebrain to key respiratory centers in the brainstem that elicits ventilatory arrest.",

title = "Role of seizure activity within the parafascicular nucleus in cessation of respiratory rhythm and potentially {SUDEP}",
author = "Tryba, Andrew",
abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common cause of death in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy, yet the mechanisms underlying SUDEP are unknown. Recent data suggests that as seizures propagate in the brain, they can cause respiratory and/or cardiac arrest, leading to death (e.g. SUDEP). Although the precise mechanisms are unknown, seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) is the most likely cause of SUDEP. The neural pathways propagating seizure (SZR) activity from areas in the brain where seizures initiate (cortex, hippocampus and thalamus) to autonomic respiratory centers in the brainstem, resulting in respiratory failure and SUDEP are unknown. To identify SZR propagation pathways, I am using a new mouse brainslice preparation that includes cortex, hippocampus and thalamus as well as autonomic medullary areas controlling breathing. Preliminary electrophysiological data suggest that seizure-like activity resulting in repeated activation of the parafascicular nucleus (PFn) of the thalamus, disrupts and then stops rhythmic respiratory activity generated by the medullary respiratory neural network, the pre-B{\"o}tzinger Complex (preB{\"o}tC). I am testing my hypothesis that SZR propagation from the cortex to the PFn can interrupt respiratory activity, which may underlie or significantly contribute to respiratory arrest and/or SUDEP. The centromedial/parafascicular (CMn/PFn) thalamic nuclear complex is a deep brain stimulation target for control of epilepsy. However, little is known about the role the PFn may play in seizure propagation, control of breathing and/or SUDEP. The data support the hypothesis that the PFn may play a role in SUDEP, as it: 1) initiates and/or propagates SZRs; 2) innervates respiratory rhythm networks in the medulla, including the preB{\"o}tC; and, 3) its activation inhibits breathing.",

abstract = "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of a person with epilepsy and accounts for between 8 and 17\% of epilepsy-related deaths, rising to 50\% for patients with refractory epilepsy. In a mouse model of SUDEP, we have recently shown that death is due to seizure-induced respiratory arrest. In addition, apnea is initiated during the tonic phase and tonic respiratory muscle contraction is a possible mechanism of apnea. In the present study, we explore 1) whether tonic activity of the inspiratory rhythm generator in the brainstem and/or 2) upper motor neuron activity in the motor cortex drives ictal apnea. We recorded video, electrocorticogram (ECoG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and breathing via whole body plethysmography in adult mice carrying the human SCN8A encephalopathy mutation p.Asn1768Asp (N1768D; ``D/+ mice'') during audiogenic seizures. This mutation was identified from a patient that died from SUDEP and D/+ mice have severe convulsive seizures with apnea and many suffer seizure-induced death. To test the hypothesis that tonic activity from the inspiratory oscillator results in apnea, we implanted fiberoptic ferrules bilaterally into the B{\"o}tzinger Complex (B{\"o}tC) of mice that express Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) under the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT; ``VGAT-ChR2'' mice) that were crossed with D/+ mice (Fig. 1A \& B). The goal of the experiment is to photostimulate B{\"o}tC during ictal apnea to inhibit tonic inspiratory activity and produce expiration (Fig. 1C). Seizures were evoked using a 15 kHz pure tone, as we have done before (Fig. 1D). Trains of light pulses (50 ms pulses, 5 mW of 473 nm light) were evoked repetitively during ictal apnea (Fig. 1E \& F). However, this did not recover normal breathing rhythm and apnea duration was no different for any photostimulation paradigm versus control (p = 0.7892, F = 0.1747, One-Way ANOVA; Fig. 1G). Although breathing was not affected during seizures, the effects on baseline breathing were substantial; for example, inspiration was inhibited for a full 10 second photostimulation train (Fig. 1H). To test the necessity of ictal activity from upper motor neurons in the motor cortex are required for generating ictal apnea, we expressed iDREADD receptors in cortical excitatory neurons of D/+ mice and injected CNO i.p. prior to inducing seizures with a 15 kHz pure tone (Fig. 2A). Under control conditions, seizures presented with the usual tonic phase apnea and spike wave discharges (SWDs) in the motor cortex (Fig. 2B). CNO was able to robustly inhibit the SWDs, but the tonic phase and apnea were not affected (Figs. 2C-E). The effect of 3 mg/kg CNO on ECoG power was significantly greater than the effect on apnea (p = 0.0059, paired t-test). In sum, we found that the core inspiratory oscillator circuitry in the brainstem is likely bypassed to create tonic inspiratory activity. Furthermore, inhibition of cortical upper motor neurons has no effect on apnea. Thus, our interpretation is that other pools of upper motor neurons must drive the tonic inspiratory activity and apnea.",

abstract = "While the neural circuits mediating normal, adaptive defensive behaviors have been extensively studied, substantially less is currently known about the network mechanisms by which aberrant, pathological anxiety is encoded in the brain. Here we investigate in mice how deletion of Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), an inhibitory synapse-specific adhesion protein that has been associated with pathological anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, alters the communication between key brain regions involved in mediating defensive behaviors. To this end, we performed multi-site simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), centromedial amygdala (CeM), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) in an open field paradigm. We found that LFP power in the vHPC was profoundly increased and was accompanied by an abnormal modulation of the synchrony of theta frequency oscillations particularly in the vHPC-mPFC-BLA circuit. Moreover, deletion of Nlgn2 increased beta and gamma frequency synchrony across the network, and this increase was associated with increased center avoidance. Local deletion of Nlgn2 in the vHPC and BLA revealed that they encode distinct aspects of this avoidance phenotype, with vHPC linked to immobility and BLA linked to a reduction in exploratory activity. Together, our data demonstrate that alterations in long-range functional connectivity link synaptic inhibition to abnormal defensive behaviors, and that both exaggerated activation of normal defensive circuits and recruitment of fundamentally distinct mechanisms contribute to this phenotype. Nlgn2 knockout mice therefore represent a highly relevant model to study the role of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the circuits underlying anxiety disorders.",

title = "The epidemiology of epilepsy revisited",
author = "Sander, Josemir W",
abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epidemiology is the study of the dynamics of a medical condition in a population. There are many shortcomings in the understanding of the epidemiology of epilepsy mostly caused by methodological problems. These include diagnostic accuracy, case ascertainment, and selection bias. In this article recent progress in this area is discussed and suggestions for future research are made. RECENT FINDINGS: It is generally accepted that in developed countries the incidence is around 50/100 000/year. In resource-poor countries, the incidence is likely to be higher. Prevalence of active epilepsy is in the range of 5-10/1000 in most locations, although it might be higher in some isolates. Age-specific incidence rates have changed, with a decrease in younger age groups and an increase in persons above 60 years. The overall prognosis for seizure control is good and over 70\% will enter remission. Epilepsy carries an increased risk of premature death particularly in patients with chronic epilepsy. Sudden unexpected death has been increasingly recognized as a major culprit for this increased mortality. SUMMARY: There is geographic variation in the incidence of epileptic syndromes likely to be associated with genetic and environmental factors, although as yet causality has not been fully established. The complete range of aetiologies in the general population is not known. Few predictors of outcome are recognized and it is difficult to prognosticate in any individual case. Knowledge is patchy about the epidemiology of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Future epidemiological research needs to address these issues if we are to progress.",

abstract = "WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: The parabrachial nucleus (PBN), which is a brainstem region containing glutamatergic neurons, is a key arousal nucleus. Injuries to the area often prevent patient reanimation. Some studies suggest that brain regions that control arousal and reanimation are a key part of the anesthesia recovery. Therefore, we hypothesize that the PBN may be involved in regulating emergence from anesthesia. METHODS: We investigated the effects of specific activation or inhibition of PBN glutamatergic neurons on sevoflurane general anesthesia using the chemogenetic ``designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs'' approach. Optogenetic methods combined with polysomnographic recordings were used to explore the effects of transient activation of PBN glutamatergic neuron on sevoflurane anesthesia. Immunohistochemical techniques are employed to reveal the mechanism by which PBN regulated sevoflurane anesthesia. RESULTS: Chemogenetic activation of PBN glutamatergic neurons by intraperitoneal injections of clozapine-N-oxide decreased emergence time (mean $\pm$ SD, control vs. clozapine-N-oxide, 55 $\pm$ 24 vs. 15 $\pm$ 9 s, P = 0.0002) caused by sevoflurane inhalation and prolonged induction time (70 $\pm$ 15 vs. 109 $\pm$ 38 s, n = 9, P = 0.012) as well as the ED50 of sevoflurane (1.48 vs. 1.60\%, P = 0.0002), which was characterized by a rightward shift of the loss of righting reflex cumulative curve. In contrast, chemogenetic inhibition of PBN glutamatergic neurons slightly increased emergence time (56 $\pm$ 26 vs. 87 $\pm$ 26 s, n = 8, P = 0.034). Moreover, instantaneous activation of PBN glutamatergic neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 during steady-state general anesthesia with sevoflurane produced electroencephalogram evidence of cortical arousal. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that activation of PBN induced excitation of cortical and subcortical arousal nuclei during sevoflurane anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of PBN glutamatergic neurons is helpful to accelerate the transition from general anesthesia to an arousal state, which may provide a new strategy in shortening the recovery time after sevoflurane anesthesia.",

The associations of PGES and prolonged PGES (duration >20 seconds) with person- and seizure-specific variables were evaluated independently using SPSS software.Eighty patients (63.5\%, 80/126) exhibited PGES after 127 GCSs (53.6\%, 127/237) with an average PGES duration of 41.31 $\pm$ 24.03 seconds. The tonic phase was significantly prolonged in patients with PGES and prolonged PGES. PGES was independently associated with ictal semiology, which was attributable to the different proportions of GCS type 1. After seizure termination, patients with PGES had a higher percentage of postictal unresponsiveness and immobility, including oropharyngeal immobility. Between prolonged and short-duration PGES, the former was more likely to phase out gradually followed by immediate body movement, whereas the latter tended to have an abrupt, evoked termination followed by delayed body movement.Prolonged tonic duration, GCS type 1, postictal unresponsiveness, and immobility were more prone to occur with PGES, which might imply that hyperactivation of inhibitory neural networks underlies the pathophysiology of PGES and subsequent SUDEP. Any form of periictal bedside care, whether it constitutes effective medical intervention or not, is advisable due to its possible contribution to the interruption of PGES. Regardless of the PGES termination pattern, the neural network resuscitation process was progressive.",

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the clinical and electroencephalographic features and the management alternatives of the patients with HWE. METHODS: The age of seizure onset, duration of seizure, family history, interictal and postictal electroencephalography findings, triggering temperature of water, type of seizure, medication, and follow-up results were evaluated for each patient. RESULTS: The mean age at seizure onset was 10.5 years. The mean duration of seizures was 10 years. Interictal EEG recordings showed focal abnormalities in 4 patients and generalized abnormalities in 3 patients. Only one patient had normal interictal EEG findings. Among the 8 patients with HWE, 6 had seizures only during hot bathing, whereas 2 had additional seizures. Seven patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and 1 patient had complex partial seizure during their hot bathings. The mean triggering temperature of water was calculated as 41.4 degrees C. The mean duration of follow-up period was 23 months. Five patients became seizure-free during the follow-up period and seizures persisted in 3 patients. Antiepileptic drugs were given (800 mg/d carbamazepine for 2 patients and 600 mg/d phenytoin for 1 patient) to these 3 patients and they also became seizure-free during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Hot water epilepsy is a benign reflex epilepsy. Lowering water temperature must be the first step for the treatment. If needed, antiepileptic drugs should be considered as an additive treatment.",

RECENT FINDINGS: The overall incidence of SUDEP in adults with epilepsy is 1.2/1000 patient-years, with surprisingly comparable figures in children in recently published population-based studies. This risk was found to decrease over time in several cohorts at a rate of -7\% per year, for unknown reasons. Well established risk factors include frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, while adding antiepileptic treatment, nocturnal supervision and use of nocturnal listening device appear to be protective. In contrast, recent data failed to demonstrate the predictive value of heart rate variability, periictal cardiorespiratory dysfunction, and postictal generalized electroencephalography suppression. Preliminary findings suggest that brainstem and thalamic atrophy may be associated with a higher risk of SUDEP. Novel experimental and human data support the primary role of generalized tonic-clonic seizure-triggered respiratory dysfunction and the likely contribution of altered brainstem serotoninergic neurotransmission, in SUDEP pathophysiology.

Despite the complexity of serotonin's effects on various neuronal networks, ongoing research provides considerable insight into the role of serotonin in human epilepsy. This review explores the potential roles of serotonergic therapies to improve clinical outcomes in epilepsy. RECENT FINDINGS: In recent decades, research has markedly increased our knowledge of the diverse effects of serotonin on brain function. Animal models of epilepsy have identified the influence of serotonin on seizure threshold in specific brain regions, serotoninergic augmentation's protective effects on terminal apnea and mortality in SUDEP, and mechanisms underlying behavioral improvement in some models of comorbid depression. Human clinical studies are largely consistent with animal data but the translation into definitive treatment decisions has moved less rapidly. SUMMARY: Evidence for serotonergic therapy is promising for improvement in seizure control and prevention of SUDEP. For some epilepsies, such as Dravet syndrome, basic research on serotonin receptor agonists has translated into a positive clinical trial for fenfluramine.

Here, we provide an up-to-date review on measures of interictal autonomic function, focusing on heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and electrodermal activity (EDA). RECENT FINDINGS: Resting HRV, BRS and EDA are altered in patients with epilepsy compared with healthy controls. A larger body of work is available for HRV compared with BRS and EDA, and points to interictal HRV derangements across a wide range of epilepsies, including focal, generalized, and combined generalized and focal epilepsies. HRV alterations are most pronounced in temporal lobe epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and drug-resistant and chronic epilepsies. There are conflicting data on the effect of antiseizure medications on measures of interictal autonomic function. However, carbamazepine has been associated with decreased HRV. Epilepsy surgery and vagus nerve stimulation do not appear to have substantial impact on measures of interictal autonomic function but well designed studies are lacking.

Generalized convulsive seizures (GCS), perhaps through their effects on brainstem cardiopulmonary networks, can cause significant postictal respiratory and autonomic dysfunction though other mechanisms likely exist as well. Work in animal models of SUDEP has identified multiple neurotransmitter systems, which may be future targets for pharmacological intervention. There are also chronic functional and structural changes in autonomic function in patients who subsequently die from SUDEP suggesting that some SUDEP risk is dynamic.

These studies further continue to support that incidence is similar across the ages and that comparable factors portend heightened risk for SUDEP. Fervent research in patients and animal studies continues to hone the understanding of potential mechanisms for SUDEP, especially those regarding seizure-induced respiratory dysregulation. Many of these studies and others have begun to lay out a path towards identification of improved treatment and prevention means. However, continued efforts are needed to educate medical professionals about SUDEP risk and the need to disclose this to patients. SUMMARY: SUDEP is a devastating potential outcome of epilepsy. More is continually learned about risk and mechanisms from clinical and preclinical studies. This knowledge can hopefully be leveraged into preventive measures in the near future.",

abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neurosteroids are a family of compounds synthesized directly in the brain by transforming cholesterol into pregnenolone, which is then converted to compounds such as allopregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone. In view of their ability to modulate neurotransmission, neurosteroids may influence the clinical course of epileptic disorders. In this review, we highlight two emerging properties of neurosteroids, that is, their anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic activities. RECENT FINDINGS: It has been shown that fluctuations in neurosteroid synthesis, such as those seen in response to stress or during the ovarian cycle, determine an increase in seizure threshold. Moreover, increased neurosteroid synthesis, presumably occurring in glial cells during epileptogenesis, delays the appearance of recurrent spontaneous seizures in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy; such an effect may be due to augmented tonic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-mediated inhibition. Finally, clinical trials with ganaxolone, an allopregnanolone analogue, have demonstrated beneficial effects in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients, whereas finasteride--which interferes with neurosteroid synthesis - facilitates seizures in catamenial epilepsy. SUMMARY: The overall evidence suggests that neurosteroids may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in epileptic disorders and a future perspective to control epileptogenicity.",

Ongoing collaborative research is aiming to improve assessment of individual SUDEP risk and to develop preventive measures based on pathophysiological considerations. This review focuses on novel findings in humans and animal models related to pathophysiology, risk factors and prevention of SUDEP. RECENT FINDINGS: Potential mechanisms include cardiac arrhythmia, postictal cardiomyopathy, depressed autonomic function and seizure-related respiratory failure. Electrocardiography predictors of sudden cardiac death have been described in people with chronic epilepsy, but their significance for SUDEP remains to be confirmed. Epidemiological risk factors comprise male sex, young age at epilepsy onset, symptomatic cause, longer duration of epilepsy, frequent convulsive seizures and polytherapy. Efficacious adjunctive antiepileptic medication may reduce the risk of SUDEP. SUMMARY: Novel clinical features may help to define better the individual risk of SUDEP. Potentially therapeutic strategies including pharmacological modulation of respiratory arrest and implantation of cardiac devices could reduce the risk of SUDEP in some individuals. Antiepileptic drugs lower the risk, stressing the importance of successful seizure control for prevention.",

Although epidemiological studies of SUDEP in heterogenous populations have established a number of clinical associations, evaluation and stratification of individual risk remains difficult. Thus, potential markers as predictors of risk of SUDEP are important not only clinically but also for research on SUDEP prevention. Recordings from rare monitored cases of SUDEP demonstrate postictal generalized EEG suppression after terminal seizures, raising expectations that postictal generalized EEG suppression may identify individuals at higher risk.

High-frequency oscillations reflect a range of neuronal processes contributing to overlapping frequencies from the lower 80 Hz to the very fast spectral frequency bands. Given their complex neuronal nature, HFOs are extremely sensitive to recording conditions and analytical approaches.

These cardiac and autonomic changes are more frequently seen in patients with longstanding and medication refractory epilepsy and may be a prerequisite for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Cardiac changes are also observed within the immediate periictal period in patients with and without preexisting cardiac pathology and could be the tipping point in the cascade of events compromising autonomic, respiratory, and cardiac function during an epileptic convulsion.

author = "Tr{\'e}buchon, Agn{\`e}s and Chauvel, Patrick",
abstract = "The challenge in epilepsy surgery is to remove the epileptogenic zone without compromising postoperative function. Electrical stimulation (ES) was developed to identify with greater anatomical and physiological precision cortical structures essential to language and motor function. Because the language network is widely distributed in the left (dominant) hemisphere, and often varies among patients, brain mapping should delineate eloquent areas at the individual level. Although ES for language is commonly performed during a presurgical investigation, the procedure remains nonstandardized among centers, and differences between grids and intracerebral depth electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography) should be taken into account when comparing results from different series. Electrical simulation exerts a complex summation effect in a given volume of brain tissue; the net result may be difficult to predict because this depends on methodological and physiological factors as follows: stimulation parameters, type of electrodes used, tasks used, presence or not of an after-discharge. We discuss in the present article some methodological aspects of the stimulation procedure influencing functional mapping because it pertains in particular to language mapping. In stereoelectroencephalography, the other goal of ES is to trigger seizures. Because seizures develop in neural networks that are imperfectly sampled by intracerebral electrodes, spontaneous seizure recording is not always sufficient to properly localize the epileptogenic zone. The rationale for performing ES is based on the electrophysiological distinction between local/regional after-discharge and seizure networks. A different response to ES-induced seizures can be seen for supra- and infra-sylvian epilepsies. The procedures for triggering seizures and for functional mapping should be performed in conjunction to answer the fundamental question whether or not there is a spatio-temporal overlap between the epileptogenic and the functional network. The exploration of both networks through stimulation exemplifies the importance of anatomo-electro-clinical correlations in stereoelectroencephalography.",

The various clinical forms of insular epilepsies were delineated during the last 2 decades, and include the following presentations: perisylvian epilepsy, temporal plus epilepsy, sleep hypermotor epilepsy, MRI-negative frontal and parietal lobe epilepsies, and insular lesions. In fact, a majority of complex stereoelectroencephalography procedures will include at least one electrode targeting the insula. Stereoelectroencephalography is currently the preferred method to investigate the insula, using orthogonal, oblique, or a combination of both trajectories, with no evidence of higher risk of intracranial bleeding than in other brain regions. Orthogonal trajectories allow to sample the overlaying opercula, while oblique trajectories offer a better sampling of the insular cortex. Intrainsular ictal EEG pattern are often characterized by a prolonged focal discharge restricted to one of the five insular gyri, militating for a dense enough sampling of the insular cortex in suspected insular epilepsies.

The stimulation parameters offered in this article need to be adjusted within safe limits to address the factors. Each ESM procedure should be tailored to the patient's age and baseline mental or psychological capacity. Stimulation-induced seizures and EEG afterdischarges disrupt ESM procedure and render the interpretation of the results difficult. There are specific measures that can lessen the risk of seizures and afterdischarges during ESM. Electrical stimulation mapping procedure requires several tasks on the part of those conducting the procedure, such as operating the stimulator and the EEG recording equipment, administering behavioral or language tests and observing both patient and EEG responses to the stimulation. A team of experienced staff is necessary for individual assumption of each task. Knowledge of the spatial relationship between electrode contacts and underlying normal or abnormal brain structures is essential for interpreting ESM results. When testing for motor or sensory response, be aware of the distinction between responses at the primary motor area and responses at the supplementary sensorimotor area. The anatomy of supplementary sensorimotor area is more variable and functional than it is fixed and structural, although its general confines and somatotopic organization are known. In addition, negative motor responses to stimulation must be recognized to avoid misinterpretation of ESM results, especially in language mapping.",

To our knowledge, detailed EEG findings in COVID-19 have not yet been reported. This report adds to the scarce body of evidence. METHODS: We identified eight COVID-19 positive patients who underwent EEG monitoring in our hospital system. RESULTS: EEGs were most commonly ordered for an altered level of consciousness, a nonspecific neurologic manifestation. We observed generalized background slowing in all patients and generalized epileptiform discharges with triphasic morphology in three patients. Focal electrographic seizures were observed in one patient with a history of focal epilepsy and in another patient with no such history. Five of eight patients had a previous diagnosis of epilepsy, suggesting that pre-existing epilepsy can be a potential risk factor for COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations. Five of eight patients who underwent EEG experienced a fatal outcome of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore previous observations that neurologic manifestations are common in severe cases.

abstract = "PURPOSE: Both vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS System) are treatment options for medically refractory focal epilepsy. The mechanism of action of both devices remains poorly understood. Limited prior evidence suggests that acute VNS stimulation may reduce epileptiform activity and cause EEG desynchronization on electrocorticography (ECoG). Our study aims to isolate effects of VNS on ECoG as recorded by RNS System in patients who have both devices, by comparing ECoG samples with and without acute VNS stimulation. METHODS: Ten 60-second ECoGs each from 22 individuals at 3 epilepsy centers were obtained-5 ECoGs with VNS ``off'' and 5 ECoGs with VNS ``on.'' Electrocorticograps containing seizures or loss of telemetry connection artifact were excluded from analysis (total of 169 ECoGs were included). Electrocorticographs were analyzed for differences in spectral content by generating average spectrograms for ``on'' and ``off'' states and using a linear mixed-effects model to isolate effects of VNS stimulation. RESULTS: Acute VNS stimulation reduced average power in the theta band by 4.9\%, beta band by 3.8\%, and alpha band by 2.5\%. The reduction in theta power reached statistical significance with a P value of <0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that acute VNS stimulation results in desynchronization of specific frequency bands (salient decrease in theta and beta bands, smaller decrease in alpha band) in ECoGs recorded by the RNS device in patients with dual (VNS and RNS) neurostimulators. This finding offers support for desynchronization as a theorized mechanism of action of VNS. Further research may lead to future improved neurostimulator efficacy by informing optimal stimulation programming parameters.",

IRCs occur in children and adults, and diminished central drive is frequent, although peripheral obstruction is observed occasionally. Case reports of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) have suggested IRC as a mechanism. In a series of 15 witnessed SUDEP cases, overt convulsions with marked respiratory difficulty were observed in 12. For two cases, obstructive mechanisms may have predominated. One near-SUDEP case implicated central apnea, but another case implicated postictal laryngospasm. Inhibition of brainstem respiratory control circuits likely subserves IRCs. The pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex in the rostral ventrolateral medulla is a key locus for respiratory rhythm generation, with expiratory control neurons near the nucleus ambiguous. Inputs to these neurons descend from the insula, hypothalamus, and reticular formation. Direct stimulation of limbic targets in humans causes apnea. Animal models of focal seizures with IRCs and SUDEP have produced inconsistent results: some support central mechanisms, whereas others implicate peripheral obstruction. Serotonin seems relevant in a mouse model of SUDEP. These models may elucidate how seizures embarrass respiration and possibly predispose patients to SUDEP.",

In neurosurgical series of symptomatic OLE, interictal EEG abnormalities are rarely strictly occipital. The most common localization is in the posterior temporal regions and less than one-fifth show occipital spikes.

Recently, we reported that treatment with naringin, a flavonoid found in grapefruit and citrus fruits, reduced spontaneous recurrent seizures by inhibiting kainic acid (KA)-induced GCD and neuronal cell death in mouse hippocampus, suggesting that naringin might have beneficial effects for preventing epileptic events in the adult brain. However, it is still unclear whether the beneficial effects of naringin treatment are mediated by the metabolism of naringin into naringenin in the KA-treated hippocampus. To investigate this possibility, we evaluated whether intraperitoneal injections of naringenin could mimic naringin-induced effects against GCD caused by intrahippocampal KA injections in mice. Our results showed that treatment with naringenin delayed the onset of KA-induced seizures and attenuated KA-induced GCD by inhibiting activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 in both neurons and reactive astrocytes in the DG. In addition, its administration attenuated the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$) and interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$) from microglial activation in the DG following KA treatment. These results suggest that naringenin may be an active metabolite of naringin and help prevent the progression of epileptic insults in the hippocampus in vivo; therefore, naringenin may be a beneficial metabolite of naringin for the treatment of epilepsy.",

Tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) is the rate-limiting enzyme of central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) synthesis which converts l-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan. A recent study revealed a reduction in TPH2 protein expression in the brainstems of DBA/1 mice that developed recurrent seizure-induced respiratory arrest, whereas the activity of this protein was unexplored. Thus this study aims to investigate the association between intrinsic 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis in the brainstem and the susceptibility for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy in DBA/1 mice. The effect of LY393558, a potent 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitor with 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist properties, on seizure-induced respiratory arrest evoked by acoustic stimulation was also examined in DBA/1 mice. ELISA results showed significantly decreased TPH2 activity in the brainstems of untreated DBA/1 mice than that of C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, the concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptophan and 5-HIAA in the brainstems of DBA/1 mice with or without acoustic stimulation were significantly lower than that of C57BL/6J mice. Acute administration of LY393558 also significantly reduced seizure-induced respiratory arrest in DBA/1 mice. These observations provide novel evidences for the hypothesis that 5-hydroxytryptamine deficiency might be a potential cause of seizure-induced respiratory arrest.",

abstract = "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) play an important role in numerous functions in the central and peripheral nervous systems ranging from memory and emotions to pain. The data correspond to a recent notion that each neuron and many glial cells of the mammalian brain express at least one member of the ASIC family. However, the mechanisms underlying the involvement of ASICs in neuronal activity are poorly understood. However, there are two exceptions, namely, the straightforward role of ASICs in proton-based synaptic transmission in certain brain areas and the role of the Ca(2+)-permeable ASIC1a subtype in ischaemic cell death. Using a novel orthosteric ASIC antagonist, we have found that ASICs specifically control the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic activity in the hippocampus. Inhibition of ASICs leads to a strong increase in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents. This effect is presynaptic because it is fully reproducible in single synaptic boutons attached to isolated hippocampal neurons. In concert with this observation, inhibition of the ASIC current diminishes epileptic discharges in a low Mg(2+) model of epilepsy in hippocampal slices and significantly reduces kainate-induced discharges in the hippocampus in vivo Our results reveal a significant novel role for ASICs.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolution brings Ca(2+) and ATP together to control life and death'.",

Here, we report that the PBN receives dense inputs from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), an extended amygdala structure that encodes affective information. Using a series of complementary approaches, we identify opposing BNST-PBN circuits that modulate a genetically-defined population of PBN neurons to control feeding.

abstract = "Pathogenic variants in epilepsy genes result in a spectrum of clinical presentation, ranging from benign phenotypes to intractable epilepsies with significant co-morbidities and increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). One source of this phenotypic heterogeneity is modifier genes that affect penetrance, dominance or expressivity of a primary pathogenic variant. Mouse models of epilepsy also display varying degrees of clinical severity on different genetic backgrounds. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a ( Scn1a +/− ) model Dravet syndrome, a severe epilepsy most often caused by SCN1A haploinsufficiency. Scn1a +/− heterozygous mice recapitulate key features of Dravet syndrome, including febrile and afebrile spontaneous seizures, SUDEP, and cognitive and behavioral deficits. The Scn1a +/− mouse model also exhibits strain-dependent phenotype severity. Scn1a +/− mice maintained on the 129S6/SvEvTac (129) strain have normal lifespan and no overt seizures. In contrast, admixture with C57BL/6J (B6) results in severe epilepsy and premature lethality in [B6$\times$129]F1. Scn1a +/− mice. In previous work, we identified Dravet Survival Modifier loci ( Dsm1-Dsm5 ) responsible for strain-dependent differences in survival. Gabra2 , encoding the GABAA $\alpha$2 subunit, was nominated as the top candidate modifier at the Dsm1 locus on chromosome 5. Direct measurement of GABAA receptors found lower abundance of $\alpha$2-containing receptors in hippocampal synapses of B6 mice relative to 129. We also identified a B6-specific single nucleotide intronic deletion within Gabra2 that lowers mRNA and protein by nearly 50\%. Repair of this de novo deletion reestablished normal levels of Gabra2 transcript and protein expression. In the current study, we used B6 mice with the repaired Gabra2 allele to validate it as a modifier of phenotype severity in Scn1a +/− mice. Repair of Gabra2 restored transcript and protein expression, increased abundance of $\alpha$2-containing GABAA receptors in hippocampal synapses, and improved seizure and survival phenotypes of Scn1a +/− mice. These findings validate Gabra2 as a genetic modifier of Dravet syndrome. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: J.A.K. serves as a consultant to Encoded Genomics, Praxis Precision Medicines and NeuroCycle Therapeutics, and serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Dravet Syndrome Foundation.

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. A proposed risk marker for SUDEP is the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES). The mechanisms underlying PGES are unknown. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in SUDEP pathophysiology. Seizures suppress activity of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We hypothesized that suppression of DRN 5-HT neuron activity contributes to PGES and increasing 5-HT neurotransmission or stimulating the DRN before a seizure would decrease PGES duration. Adult C57BL/6 and Pet1-Cre mice received EEG/EMG electrodes, a bipolar stimulating/recording electrode in the right basolateral amygdala, and either a microdialysis guide cannula or an injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) allowing expression of channelrhodopsin2 plus an optic fiber into the DRN. Systemic application of the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram (20 mg/kg) decreased PGES duration from seizures induced during wake (n = 23) and NREM sleep (n = 13) whereas fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) pretreatment decreased PGES duration following seizures induced from wake (n = 11), but not NREM sleep (n = 9). Focal chemical (n = 6) or optogenetic (n = 8) stimulation of the DRN reduced PGES duration following kindled seizures and reduced morality following maximal electroshock seizures (n = 6) induced during wake. During PGES, animals exhibited immobility and suppression of EEG activity that was reduced by citalopram pretreatment. These results indicate that 5-HT and the DRN may regulate PGES and seizure-induced mortality.

In autopsy hippocampus and cortex, we observed no proteomic differences between SUDEP and epilepsy cases, contrasting our previously reported robust differences between epilepsy and controls. Transcriptomics in hippocampus and cortex from surgical epilepsy cases segregated by PGES identified 55 differentially expressed genes (37 protein-coding, 15 lncRNAs, three pending) in hippocampus.

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the fatal cause leading to the death of epilepsy patients with anti-epileptic drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanism of SUDEP remains to be elusive. Our previous study demonstrated that enhancement of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan in brain significantly reduced the incidence of seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) in DBA/1 mice SUDEP models. Given that 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) acts an important role in mediating respiration system in brain, we hypothesized that 5-HT2AR is of great significance to modulate S-IRA and SUDEP. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the decreased incidence S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or PTZ by blocking 5-HT2AR by administration with ketanserin (KET), a selective antagonist of 5HT2AR, in DBA/1 mice SUDEP models to test the role of 5-HT2AR modulating S-IRA. Our results suggested that the decreased incidence of S-IRA by 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a precursor for central nervous system (CNS) serotonin (5-HT) synthesis, was significantly reversed by IP and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injection of ketanserin in our models.

abstract = "Sudden death in epilepsy, or SUDEP, is a fatal condition that accounts for more than 4000 deaths each year. Limited clinical and preclinical data on sudden death suggests critical contributions from autonomic, cardiac, and respiratory pathways. Recent animal (rat) studies on kainic acid induced seizure models explored a potential mechanism for such sudden and severe cardiorespiratory dysregulation being linked to acid reflux induced laryngospasm. Here, we expand on those previous investigations and utilize a multimodal approach to provide visual evidence of acid reflux-initiated laryngospasm and subsequent fatal cardiorespiratory distress in seizing rats. We used systemic kainic acid to acutely induce seizure activity in Long Evans rats, under urethane anesthesia. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), chest plethysmography and esophageal pH signals during simultaneous fast MRI scans of the rat stomach and esophagus. MRI images, in conjunction with electrophysiology data were used to identify seizure progression, stomach acid movement up the esophagus, cardiorespiratory changes, and sudden death. In all cases of sudden death, esophageal pH recordings alongside MRI images visualized stomach acid movement up the esophagus. Severe cardiac (ST segment elevation), respiratory (intermittent apnea) and brain activity (EEG narrowing due to hypoxia) changes were observed only after acid reached the larynx, which strongly suggests onset of laryngospasm following acid reflux. Additionally, absence of stomach acid in the esophagus of animals that survived acute seizure, provided evidence of a causal relationship between acid reflux and sudden death. The complimentary information coming from electrophysiology and fast MRI scans provided insight into the mechanism of esophageal reflux, laryngospasm, obstructive apnea, and subsequent sudden death in seizing animals. The results carry clinical significance as they outline a potential mechanism that may be relevant to SUDEP in humans. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

However, the brain structures mediating these respiratory abnormalities remain unknown. We hypothesize that Kv1.1 deficiency in respiratory control centers of the brain contribute to respiratory dysfunction in Kcna1-/- mice leading to increased SUDEP risk. Thus, in this study, we first used immunohistochemistry to map expression of Kv1.1 protein in cardiorespiratory brain regions of wild-type Kcna1+/+ (WT) mice. Next, GFAP and Iba1 immunostaining was used to test for the presence of astrogliosis and microgliosis, respectively, in the cardiorespiratory centers of Kcna1-/- mice, which could be indicative of seizure-related brain injury that could impair breathing. In WT type mice, we detected Kv1.1 protein in all cardiorespiratory centers examined, including the basolateral amygdala, dorsal respiratory group, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, nucleus ambiguus, ventral respiratory column, and pontine respiratory group, as well as chemosensory centers including the retrotrapezoid and median raphae nuclei.

abstract = "Scents have been employed for millennia to allay fear and stress, but whether they do so is poorly understood. In response to fear and stress, hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone neurons (CRHNs) induce increases in blood stress hormones. Here, we find that certain structurally and perceptually dissimilar odorants can block mouse stress hormone responses to three potent stressors: physical restraint, predator odor, and male-male social confrontation. Both odorants activate GABAergic inhibitory neurons presynaptic to CRHNs in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMH). Stimulation of those neurons inhibits restraint-induced activation of CRHNs and stress hormone increase, mimicking a blocking odorant. Conversely, their silencing prevents odorant blocking of both responses. Notably, we also observed odor blocking of stressor activation in neurons presynaptic to CRHNs in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Together, these findings indicate that selected odorants can indeed block stress responses, and that odor blocking can occur via two routes: a direct route in which blocking odor signals directly inhibit CRHNs and an indirect route in which they inhibit stressor activation of neurons presynaptic to CRHNs and prevent them from transmitting stress signals to CRHNs. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. * AH : anterior hypothalamic area ARC : arcuate hypothalamic nucleus AVPe : anteroventral periventricular nucleus BNSTa : bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior part BNSTp : bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, posterior part DMH : dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus LH : lateral hypothalamic area LPAG : lateral periaqueductal grey LPGi : lateral paragigantocellular nucleus LPO : lateral preoptic area LS : lateral septal nucleus MnPO : median preoptic nucleus MPA : medial preoptic area MPO : medial preoptic nucleus MTu : medial tuberal nucleus NTS : nucleus of the solitary tract PBN : parabrachial nucleus Pe : periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus PH : posterior hypothalamic nucleus PLH : peduncular part of lateral hypothalamus PMV : premammillary nucleus, ventral part SCh : suprachiasmatic nucleus SHy : septohippocampal nucleus StHy : striohypothalamic nucleus VMH : ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus ZI : zona incerta",

TMT exposure may activate metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGlu3), triggering excitatory corticolimbic adaptations that underlie behavioral changes. To evaluate functional involvement, the mGlu3 negative allosteric modulator (NAM, VU6010572; 3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered before TMT exposure in male, Long Evans rats. Two weeks after stressor, rats underwent behavioral testing (context re-exposure, zero maze and acoustic startle response) followed by RT-PCR gene expression in the insular cortex and BNST. During the TMT exposure, rats displayed stress-reactive behaviors that were not affected by the VU6010572. During the context re-exposure, prior TMT exposure and VU6010572 pretreatment both produced a hyperactive response. TMT exposure did not affect zero maze or ASR measures, but VU6010572 increased time spent in the open arms and habituation to ASR, indicating anxiolytic-like effects. In the insular cortex, TMT exposure resulted in excitatory adaptations as shown by increased expression of mGlu ( Grm3, Grm5 ), NMDA ( GriN2A, GriN2B, GriN2C, GriN3A, GriN3B ) and AMPA ( GriA3 ) receptor transcripts. Interestingly, mGlu3 signaling during stressor mediated GriN3B upregulation. Stress reactivity during TMT exposure was associated with Grm5, GriN2A, GriN2C , and GriA3 upregulation in the insular cortex and context re-exposure reactivity in the TMT/vehicle, but not the TMT/mGlu3 NAM group. In the BNST, GriN2A, GriN2B and GriN3B were increased by VU6010572, but TMT prevented these effects.

A novel approach assessing PV-IN function in the same mice at two developmental time points showed that, at post-natal day (P) 16-21, spike generation was impaired all mice, deceased prior or surviving to P35. However, synaptic transmission was selectively dysfunctional in pre-weanling mice that did not survive. Spike generation in surviving mice normalized by P35, yet we again identified abnormalities in synaptic transmission. We conclude that combined dysfunction of PV-IN spike generation and synaptic transmission drives disease severity, while ongoing dysfunction of synaptic transmission contributes to chronic pathology.

A clear characterisation of the connections linking the subiculum and BNST in humans and non-human primates is lacking. To address this, we first delineated the projections from the subiculum to the BNST using anterograde tracers injected into macaque monkeys, revealing evidence for a monosynaptic subiculum-BNST projection involving the fornix. Second, we used in vivo diffusion MRI tractography in macaques and humans to demonstrate substantial subiculum complex connectivity to the BNST in both species. This connection was primarily mediated through the fornix, with additional connectivity via the amygdala, consistent with rodent anatomy. Third, utilising the twin-based nature of our human sample, we found that microstructural properties of these tracts are moderately heritable (h2 ∼ 0.5). In a final analysis, we found no evidence of any significant association between subiculum complex-BNST tract microstructure and indices of perceived stress/dispositional negativity and alcohol use, derived from principal component analysis decomposition of self-report data. We did, however, find subiculum complex-BNST tract microstructure associations with BMI, age, and sex.

abstract = "Dysregulation in the neural circuitry that encodes physiological arousal responses is thought to contribute to the manifestation of the maladaptive behaviors observed in neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously found that prepronociceptin -expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( Pnoc BNST neurons) modulate rapid changes in physiological arousal upon presentation of motivationally salient stimuli ([Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2020][1]). However, whether Pnoc BNST neurons are necessary to regulate behavioral actions to motivationally salient stimuli is still unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Pnoc BNST neurons in encoding behavioral responses to motivationally salient stimuli using in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic approaches in freely behaving mice. We find that the bulk activity of Pnoc BNST neurons increases when mice are near an aversive odor in comparison to a rewarding odor. However, optogenetic inhibition of Pnoc BNST neurons does not affect the amount of time mice spend near an aversive odor. Further analysis revealed that a subgroup of Pnoc BNST neurons that correlate with proximity to the aversive odor also correlate to darting away from the same aversive odor. Since these two behaviors are opposite to each other and since we previously found Pnoc BNST neurons correlate with arousal responses, we believe these results may be due in part to the encoding of arousal responses that occur when mice approach and dart away from aversive stimuli. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.

abstract = "The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) projects to areas of the forebrain involved in behavior. Homeostatic challenges and salient cues activate the PVT and evidence shows that the PVT regulates appetitive and aversive responses. The brainstem is a source of afferents to the PVT and the present study was done to determine if the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB) is a relay for inputs to the PVT. Retrograde tracing experiments with cholera toxin B (CTB) demonstrate that the LPB contains more PVT projecting neurons than other regions of the brainstem including the catecholamine cell groups. The hypothesis that the LPB is a relay for brainstem signals to the PVT was assessed using an intersectional monosynaptic rabies tracing approach. Sources of inputs included the reticular formation, periaqueductal gray (PAG), nucleus cuneiformis, superior and inferior colliculi, and the LPB. Distinctive clusters of input cells to LPB-PVT projecting neurons were also found in the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTDL) and the lateral central nucleus of the amygdala (CeL). Anterograde viral tracing demonstrates that LPB-PVT neurons densely innervate all of the PVT in addition to providing collateral innervation to the preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, zona incerta and PAG but not the BSTDL and CeL. The paper discusses the anatomical evidence that suggests that the PVT is part of a network of interconnected neurons involved in arousal, homeostasis, and the regulation of behavioral states with forebrain regions potentially providing descending modulation or gating of signals relayed from the LPB to the PVT. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. * 3V : third ventricle 4V : fourth ventricle 7N : facial nucleus ac : anterior commissure aq : aqueduct BLA : basolateral amygdala BMA : basomedial amygdala BSTDL : bed nucleus of stria terminalis, dorsolateral BSTL : bed nucleus of stria terminalis, lateral BSTM : bed nucleus of stria terminalis, medial BSTV : bed nucleus of stria terminalis, ventral BSTVL : bed nucleus of stria terminalis, ventrolateral CeL : central amygdala, lateral-capsular division CeM : central amygdala, medial CnF : nucleus cuneiformis cp : cerebral peduncle CPu : caudate putamen CTB : cholera toxin subunit B DMH : dorsomedial hypothalamus DR : dorsal raphe dscp : decussation superior cerebellar peduncle DT : dorsal tegmental nucleus f : fornix Hb : habenular nucleus ic : internal capsule IC : inferior colliculus IMD : intermediodorsal nucleus of thalamus IPAC : interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure KF : Killiker-Fuse nucleus LC : locus ceruleus LH : lateral hypothalamus LPB : lateral aspect of the parabrachial nucleus LPO : lateral preoptic area LRt : lateral reticular nucleus LV : lateral ventricle MD : mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus MdRt : medullary reticular nucleus Me5 : mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus mfb : medial forebrain bundle MGN : medial geniculate nucleus ml : medial lemniscus MnPO : median preoptic nucleus MPB : medial aspect of the parabrachial nucleus MPO : medial preoptic nucleus Mt : mammillothalamic tract NAcSh : shell of the nucleus accumbens NTS : nucleus of the solitary tract opt : optic tract PAG : periaqueductal gray PAGD : periaqueductal gray, dorsal PAGV : periaqueductal gray, ventral PB : parabrachialc nucleus PCRt : parvicellular reticular nucleus PLH : perifornical lateral hypothalamus POA : preoptic area PSTh : parasubthalamic hypothalamus PT : paratenial nucleus of the thalamus PVN : paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus PVT : paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus aPVT : anterior aspect of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus pPVT : posterior aspect of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus py : pyramidal tract RF : reticular formation mRF : mesencephalic reticular formation mdRF : medullary reticular formation pRF : pontine reticular formation rs : rubrospinal tract SC : superior colliculus scp : superior cerebellar peduncle scpd : superior cerebellar peduncle, descend limb sm : stria medullaris of the thalamus SNL : lateral substantia nigra sp5 : spinal trigeminal tract Sp5 : spinal trigeminal nucleus Sp5C : spinal trigeminal nucleus, caudal STh : subthalamic hypothalamus TH : tyrosine hydroxylase TRIO : tracing the input-output organization method Ve : vestibular nucleus VLM : ventrolateral medulla VMH : ventromedial hypothalamus VP : ventral pallidum ZI : zona incerta",

abstract = "Epilepsy is often comorbid with psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety and depression. Despite the high incidence of psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, few studies address the underlying mechanisms. Stress can trigger both epilepsy and depression and significant accumulating evidence, from both human and animal studies, support that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction may contribute to the comorbidity of these two disorders[1][1]. Here we directly investigate the contribution of HPA axis dysfunction to epilepsy outcomes and psychiatric comorbidities. We generated a novel mouse model (KCC2/Crh mice) that lacks the K+/Cl- co-transporter, KCC2, in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, which exhibit stress- and seizure-induced hyperactivation of the HPA axis.[2][2],[3][3] Here we demonstrate that HPA axis dysfunction in KCC2/Crh mice is associated with increased vulnerability to behavioral deficits in chronically epileptic mice and more severe neuropathological features associated with chronic epilepsy (e.g. increased mossy fiber sprouting). Despite equivalent seizure burden, HPA axis dysfunction in these chronically epileptic mice increased the incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Suppressing HPA axis hyperexcitability in this model using a pharmacological or chemogenetic approach decreased SUDEP incidence, supporting HPA axis dysfunction in SUDEP vulnerability. We also observed changes in neuroendocrine markers in individuals that died of SUDEP compared to people with epilepsy or individuals without a history of epilepsy. Together, these findings describe a novel, nongenetic mouse model of SUDEP which will benefit preclinical SUDEP research to gain a better understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms contributing to SUDEP. HPA axis dysfunction increases vulnerability to psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy and may be a risk factor for SUDEP. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement J.M. serves on the Scientific Advisory Board for SAGE Therapeutics and has a sponsored research agreement with SAGE Therapeutics for experiments unrelated to the current study.

abstract = "Neuropeptides are key signaling molecules in the endocrine and nervous systems that regulate many critical physiological processes, including energy balance, sleep and circadian rhythms, stress, and social behaviors. Understanding the functions of neuropeptides in vivo requires the ability to monitor their dynamics with high specificity, sensitivity, and spatiotemporal resolution; however, this has been hindered by the lack of direct, sensitive and non-invasive tools. Here, we developed a series of GRAB (G protein-coupled receptor activation-based) sensors for detecting somatostatin (SST), cholecystokinin (CCK), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurotensin (NTS), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These fluorescent sensors utilize the corresponding GPCRs as the neuropeptide-sensing module with the insertion of a circular-permutated GFP as the optical reporter. This design detects the binding of specific neuropeptides at nanomolar concentration with a robust increase in fluorescence. We used these GRAB neuropeptide sensors to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of endogenous SST release in isolated pancreatic islets and to detect the release of both CCK and CRF in acute brain slices. Moreover, we detect endogenous CRF release induced by stressful experiences in vivo using fiber photometry and 2-photon imaging in mice. Together, these new sensors establish a robust toolkit for studying the release, function, and regulation of neuropeptides under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement Y.L. and H.W. have filed patent applications (international patent PCT/CN2018/107533), the value of which might be affected by this publication.

Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that the activation of GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs) directly in the brain through overexpression of GLP-1 or GLP-1R agonists produces potent anorexigenic effects, yet the behavioral role and modulation of the endogenous GLP-1 producing system in the brain by energy status is unclear. In this study, we examined the anatomical, physiological, and behavioral properties of preproglucagon-expressing neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract, Gcg NTS neurons, which serve as the primary source of GLP-1 in the brain. Using transgenic laboratory mice, we observed no sex differences in the density and distribution of Gcg NTS neurons in male and female mice. Fos immunolabeling experiments show that Gcg NTS neurons are not significantly activated after intermittent access to palatable food, but the magnitude of Fos activation was linearly related to the amount of food intake in mice provided with ad libitum intermittent access to palatable food. Electrophysiological examination of Gcg NTS neurons revealed that these neurons show energy-status and sex-dependent changes in neuronal firing and intrinsic excitability. Twenty-four hour food deprivation produced a significant reduction in excitability and firing in male, but not female mice. We then used optogenetics to investigate the causal behavioral role of Gcg NTS neurons. High frequency optogenetic activation of Gcg NTS neurons using the red light-gated opsin ChrimsonR produced female-specific anxiety-like behavior and real-time place aversion. For feeding, we observed that reversible optogenetic stimulation at high frequencies produced a significant reduction in homeostatic refeeding that did not differ by sex. Using operant conditioning, we found that reversible optogenetic activation of Gcg NTS neurons at 20 Hz, but not 5, also reduces appetitive behavior. These data demonstrate that GcgNTS neurons exert control over motivation and food-seeking behavior in addition to consumption. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of premature mortality among people with epilepsy. Evidence from witnessed and monitored SUDEP cases indicate seizure-induced cardiovascular and respiratory failures; yet, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. SUDEP occurs often during the night and early morning hours, suggesting that sleep or circadian rhythm-induced changes in physiology contribute to the fatal event. Resting-state fMRI studies have found altered functional connectivity between brain structures involved in cardiorespiratory regulation in later SUDEP cases and in individuals at high-risk of SUDEP. However, those connectivity findings have not been related to changes in cardiovascular or respiratory patterns. Here, we compared fMRI patterns of brain connectivity associated with regular and irregular cardiorespiratory rhythms in SUDEP cases with those of living epilepsy patients of varying SUDEP risk, and healthy controls. We analysed resting-state fMRI data from 98 patients with epilepsy (9 who subsequently succumbed to SUDEP, 43 categorized as low SUDEP risk (no tonic-clonic seizures (TCS) in the year preceding the fMRI scan), and 46 as high SUDEP risk (>3 TCS in the year preceding the scan)) and 25 healthy controls. The global signal amplitude (GSA), defined as the moving standard deviation of the fMRI global signal, was used to identify periods with regular ('low state') and irregular ('high state') cardiorespiratory rhythms. Correlation maps were derived from seeds in twelve regions with a key role in autonomic or respiratory regulation, for the low and high states. Following principal component analysis, component weights were compared between the groups. We found widespread alterations in connectivity of precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex in epilepsy compared to controls, in the low state (regular cardiorespiratory activity). In the low state, and to a lesser degree in the high state, reduced anterior insula connectivity (mainly with anterior and posterior cingulate cortex) in epilepsy appeared, relative to healthy controls. For SUDEP cases, the insula connectivity differences were inversely related to the interval between the fMRI scan and death. The findings suggest that anterior insula connectivity measures may provide a biomarker of SUDEP risk. The neural correlates of autonomic brain structures associated with different cardiorespiratory rhythms may shed light on the mechanisms underlying terminal apnea observed in SUDEP.",

Neurostimulation offers the ability to probe and manipulate distributed networks of interacting brain areas in dysfunctional circuits. Here, we use tools from network control theory to examine the dynamic reconfiguration of functionally interacting neuronal ensembles during targeted neurostimulation of cortical and subcortical brain structures. By integrating multi-modal intracranial recordings and diffusion tensor imaging from patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, we test hypothesized structural and functional rules that predict altered patterns of synchronized local field potentials. We demonstrate the ability to predictably reconfigure functional interactions depending on stimulation strength and location. Stimulation of areas with structurally weak connections largely modulates the functional hubness of downstream areas and concurrently propels the brain towards more difficult-to-reach dynamical states. By using focal perturbations to bridge large-scale structure, function, and markers of behavior, our findings suggest that stimulation may be tuned to influence different scales of network interactions driving cognition.",

Within the brainstem, neurons from sites in the bCPG, including the contralateral preBotC, Botzinger Complex (BotC), the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), parafacial region (pFL/pFV or RTN/pFRG), and parabrachial nuclei, send direct projections to both excitatory and inhibitory preBotC neurons. Suprapontine inputs to the excitatory and inhibitory preBotC neurons include the superior colliculus, red nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and cortex; these projections represent potential direct pathways for volitional, emotional, and physiological control of breathing.",

abstract = "The prevailing view is that parvalbumin (PV) interneurons play modulatory roles in emotional response through local medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). Here, we show that PV activity within the nucleus accumbens shell (sNAc) is required for producing anxiety-related avoidance when mice are under anxiogenic situations; sNAcPV neurons exhibited high excitability in chronically stressed mice model, which generated excessive maladaptive avoidance behavior in an anxiogenic context. We also discovered a novel GABAergic projections from the anterior dorsal bed nuclei of stria terminalis (adBNST) to sNAcPV neurons; optogenetic activation of these afferent terminals in sNAc produced an anxiolytic effect via GABA transmission. Next, we further demonstrated that chronic stressors attenuated the inhibitory synaptic transmission at adBNSTGABA ![Graphic][1] sNAcPV synapses, which in turn explains the hyperexcitability of sNAcPV neurons on stressed models; therefore, activation of these GABAergic afferents in sNAc rescued the excessive avoidance behavior related to anxious state. Our findings reveal the coordination between BNST and NAc through an inhibitory architecture in controlling of anxiety-related response and provide a neurobiological basis for therapeutic interventions in pathological anxiety.

The neuronal basis of Dravet is debatable, with evidence favoring reduced inhibition or enhanced excitation. Focusing on the firing properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the activity of both cell types through the febrile, worsening and stabilization stages. Our data indicate a temporary increase in the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons during the febrile stage, which is fully reversed by the onset of spontaneous seizures. In contrast, reduced function of O-LM interneurons persisted from the febrile through the stabilization stages, with the greatest impairment of excitability occurring during the worsening stage. Thus, both excitatory and inhibitory neurons contribute to Dravet, indicating complex and reciprocal pathophysiological neuronal changes during the different stages of the disease.",

Previous work from our lab has shown that the K1270T (KT) mutation, which is linked to GEFS+ (Genetic Epilepsy with Febrile Seizure plus) in humans, causes reduced firing of GABAergic neurons in a Drosophila knock-in model. To examine the effect of this mutation in mammals, we introduced the equivalent KT mutation into the mouse Scn1a ( Scn1a KT ) gene using CRISPR/Cas9. Mouse lines carrying this mutation were examined in two widely used genetic backgrounds, C57BL/6NJ and 129$\times$1/SvJ. In both backgrounds, homozygous mutants had spontaneous seizures and died by postnatal day 23. There was no difference in the lifespan of mice heterozygous for the mutation in either background when compared to wild-type littermates up to 6 months. Heterozygous mutants had heat-induced seizures at ~42 deg. Celsius, a temperature that did not induce seizures in wild-type littermates. In acute hippocampal slices, current-clamp recordings revealed a significant depolarized shift in action potential threshold and reduced action potential amplitude in parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in Scn1a KT/+ mice. There was no change in the firing properties of excitatory CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our results indicate that Scn1a KT/+ mice develop seizures, and impaired action potential firing of inhibitory interneurons in Scn1a KT/+ mice may produce hyperexcitability in the hippocampus.",

abstract = "The causative link between focal cortical malformations (FCM) and epilepsy is well-accepted, especially among patients with focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, the mechanisms underlying seizures remain unclear. Using a mouse model of TSC- and FCDII-associated FCM, we show that FCM neurons are responsible for seizure activity via their unexpected abnormal expression of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel isoform 4 (HCN4), which is normally not present in cortical pyramidal neurons after birth. Increasing intracellular cAMP levels, which preferentially affects HCN4 gating relative to the other isoforms, drove repetitive firing of FCM neurons but not that of control pyramidal neurons. Ectopic HCN4 expression was mTOR-dependent, preceded the onset of seizures, and was also found in diseased neurons in tissue resected for epilepsy treatment from TSC and FCDII patients. Finally, blocking HCN4 channel activity in FCM neurons prevented epilepsy in mice. These findings that demonstrate HCN4 acquisition as seizure-genic, identify a novel cAMP-dependent seizure mechanism in TSC and FCDII. Furthermore, the unique expression of HCN4 exclusively in FCM neurons provides opportunities for using HCN4 as a gene therapy target to treat epilepsy in individuals with FCDII or TSC. One Sentence Summary Our data provide a novel cAMP-dependent mechanism of seizure initiation in focal cortical dysplasia and tuberous sclerosis complex due to the unexpected ectopic expression of HCN4 channels only in diseased neurons. HCN4 channels are thus promising candidates for gene therapy to treat epilepsy generated by mTOR-driven focal malformations.",

Although we had previously reported that seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) plays an important role in modulating the occurrence of SUDEP, the exact mechanism of it to decode still needs to be explored. Given that our previous findings suggested that S-IRA evoked by acoustic stimulation or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) was markedly reduced by systemic administration of atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), in DBA/1mice SUDEP model and norepinephrine $\alpha$-1 receptor ( NE$\alpha$-1R) in brain acts as an important player in mediating the respiration function , we hypothesized that the suppressed effects of S-IRA by atomoxetine was via acting on NE$\alpha$-1R. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the suppressant incidence S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or PTZ by atomoxetine in DBA/1 mice SUDEP model. Our results suggest that the decreased incidence of S-IRA by atomoxetine was significantly reversed by intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injection of prazosin, a selective antagonist of NE$\alpha$-1R in our models. Furthermore, no obvious changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) data in cerebral cortex between the group with administration with atomoxetine and the group with administration of in PTZ injection SUDEP model to be observed.

abstract = "Antiseizure drugs (ASDs), also termed antiepileptic drugs, are the main form of symptomatic treatment for people with epilepsy, but not all patients become free of seizures. The ketogenic diet is one treatment option for drug-resistant patients. Both types of therapy exert their clinical effects through interactions with one or more of a diverse set of molecular targets in the brain. ASDs act by modulation of voltage-gated ion channels, including sodium, calcium, and potassium channels; by enhancement of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition through effects on GABAA receptors, the GABA transporter 1 (GAT1) GABA uptake transporter, or GABA transaminase; through interactions with elements of the synaptic release machinery, including synaptic vesicle 2A (SV2A) and $\alpha$2$\delta$; or by blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors, including $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors. The ketogenic diet leads to increases in circulating ketones, which may contribute to the efficacy in treating pharmacoresistant seizures. Production in the brain of inhibitory mediators, such as adenosine, or ion channel modulators, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, may also play a role. Metabolic effects, including diversion from glycolysis, are a further postulated mechanism. For some ASDs and the ketogenic diet, effects on multiple targets may contribute to activity. Better understanding of the ketogenic diet will inform the development of improved drug therapies to treat refractory seizures.",

However, research mapping the dynamics of large neuronal populations has revealed that seizures are not simply recurrent bursts of hypersynchrony. Instead, it is becoming clear that seizures involve a complex interplay of different neurons and circuits. Herein, we will review studies examining microcircuit changes that may underlie network hyperexcitability, discussing observations from network theory, computational modeling, and optogenetics.

author = "Goode, Travis D and Maren, Stephen",
abstract = "Surviving threats in the environment requires brain circuits for detecting (or anticipating) danger and for coordinating appropriate defensive responses (e.g., increased cardiac output, stress hormone release, and freezing behavior). The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a critical interface between the ``affective forebrain''-including the amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex-and the hypothalamic and brainstem areas that have been implicated in neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to actual or anticipated threats. However, the precise contribution of the BNST to defensive behavior is unclear, both in terms of the antecedent stimuli that mobilize BNST activity and the consequent defensive reactions. For example, it is well known that the BNST is essential for contextual fear conditioning, but dispensable for fear conditioning to discrete conditioned stimuli (CSs), at least as indexed by freezing behavior. However, recent evidence suggests that there are circumstances in which contextual freezing may persist independent of the BNST. Furthermore, the BNST is involved in the reinstatement (or relapse) of conditioned freezing to extinguished discrete CSs. As such, there are critical gaps in understanding how the BNST contributes to fundamental processes involved in Pavlovian fear conditioning. Here, we attempt to provide an integrative account of BNST function in fear conditioning. We discuss distinctions between unconditioned stress and conditioned fear and the role of BNST circuits in organizing behaviors associated with these states. We propose that the BNST mediates conditioned defensive responses-not based on the modality or duration of the antecedent threat or the duration of the behavioral response to the threat-but rather as consequence the ability of an antecedent stimulus to predict when an aversive outcome will occur (i.e., its temporal predictability). We argue that the BNST is not uniquely mobilized by sustained threats or uniquely involved in organizing sustained fear responses. In contrast, we argue that the BNST is involved in organizing fear responses to stimuli that poorly predict when danger will occur, no matter the duration, modality, or complexity of those stimuli. The concepts discussed in this review are critical to understanding the contribution of the human BNST to fear and anxiety disorders.",

abstract = "The vagus nerve (VN) is involved in the autonomic regulation of many physiological systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, etc.) and its stimulation is already an approved therapy for refractory epilepsy and depression. Other pathologies are thought to be treatable through vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, inflammation or auto-immune diseases. However, the efficacy of the stimulation is not always optimal, partly due to the materials and the architecture of currently available electrodes. Standard electrodes, composed of metallic rings that stimulate the whole diameter of the nerve, are not adapted to experimentations involving spatial selectivity. Efficient and selective charge injection is usually difficult to achieve simultaneously, especially in experimental setups using rodents, due to the thin diameter of their VN. In this paper, we show that we can take advantage of the high charge injection property of conducting polymers to acutely stimulate the vagus nerve in rodents, using individual active electrodes with dimensions $725\,\,\mu \mathrm\{m\}\times \,450\,\,\mu\mathrm\{m\}$. A particular PEDOT:PSS architecture integrating 12 active electrodes is developed and applied to the VN of one rat. A closed-loop VNS system developed in our previous works is used to stimulate the VN while analyzing the heart rate response. Results show the feasibility of this kind of electrodes for acute VNS on rodents and open the path towards new experimentations focused on selective stimulation and recording.",

author = "Snyder, Angela E and Salimando, Gregory J and Winder, Danny G and Silberman, Yuval",
abstract = "BACKGROUND: Relapse is a critical barrier to effective long-term treatment of alcoholism, and stress is often cited as a key trigger to relapse. Numerous studies suggest that stress-induced reinstatement to drug seeking behaviors is mediated by norepinephrine (NE) and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) signaling interactions in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a brain region critical to many behavioral and physiologic responses to stressors. Here we sought to directly examine the effects of NE on BNST CRF neuron activity and determine if these effects may be modulated by chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) exposure or a single restraint stress. METHODS: Adult, male CRF-tomato reporter mice were either treatment na{\"\i}ve, exposed to CIE for two weeks, or exposed to a single 1hr restraint stress. Effects of application of exogenous NE on BNST CRF neuron activity was assessed via whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological techniques. RESULTS: We found that NE depolarized BNST CRF neurons in na{\"\i}ve mice in a $\beta$-adrenergic receptor (AR) dependent mechanism. CRF neurons from CIE or stress-exposed mice had significantly elevated basal resting membrane potential compared to na{\"\i}ve mice. Furthermore, CIE and stress individually disrupted the ability of NE to depolarize CRF neurons, suggesting that both stress and CIE utilize $\beta$-AR signaling to modulate BNST CRF neurons. Neither stress nor CIE altered the ability of exogenous NE to inhibit evoked glutamatergic transmission onto BNST CRF neurons as shown in na{\"\i}ve mice, a mechanism previously shown to be $\alpha$-AR dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether these findings suggest that stress and CIE interact with $\beta$-AR signaling to modulate BNST CRF neuron activity, potentially disrupting the $\alpha$/$\beta$-AR balance of BNST CRF neuronal excitability. Restoration of $\alpha$/$\beta$-AR balance may lead to novel therapies for the alleviation of many stress-related disorders. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

In the first part of this 2-part review series, we examine the literature supporting the effects of alcohol exposure within the extended amygdala (EA) neural circuitry. In Part 2, we focus on a potential way to combat negative affect associated with AUD, by exploring the therapeutic potential of the endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) system. The eCB system is a potent modulator of neural activity in the brain, and its ability to mitigate stress and negative affect has long been an area of interest for developing novel therapeutics. This review details the recent advances in our understanding of eCB signaling in 2 key regions of the EA, the central nucleus of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and their role in regulating negative affect. Despite an established role for EA eCB signaling in reducing negative affect, few studies have examined the potential for eCB-based therapies to treat AUD-associated negative affect. In this review, we present an overview of studies focusing on eCB signaling in EA and cannabinoid modulation on EA synaptic activity. We further discuss studies suggesting dysregulation of eCB signaling in models of AUD and propose that pharmacological augmentation of eCB could be a novel approach to treat aspects of AUD. Lastly, future directions are proposed to advance our understanding of the relationship between AUD-associated negative affect and the EA eCB system that could yield new pharmacotherapies targeting negative affective symptoms associated with AUD.",

abstract = "Abstract Alcohol use disorder (AUD) afflicts a large number of individuals, families, and communities globally. Affective disturbances, including stress, depression, and anxiety, are highly comorbid with AUD, contributing in some cases to initial alcohol use and continued use. Negative affect has a particularly strong influence on the withdrawal/abstinence stage of addiction as individuals with AUD frequently report stressful events, depression, and anxiety as key factors for relapse. Treatment options for negative affect associated with AUD are limited and often ineffective, highlighting the pressing need for preclinical studies examining the underlying neural circuitry driving AUD-associated negative affect. The extended amygdala (EA) is a set of brain areas collectively involved in generating and regulating affect, and extensive research has defined a critical role for the EA in all facets of substance use disorder. Here we review the expansive historical literature examining the effects of ethanol exposure on the EA, with an emphasis on the complex EA neural circuitry driving negative affect in all phases of the alcohol addiction cycle. Specifically, this review focuses on the effects of alcohol exposure on the neural circuitry in two key components of the EA, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Additionally, future directions are proposed to advance our understanding of the relationship between AUD-associated negative affect and neural circuitry in the EA, with the long-term goal of developing better diagnostic tools and new pharmacological targets aimed at treating negative affect in AUD. The concepts detailed here will serve as the foundation for a companion review focusing on the potential for the endogenous cannabinoid system in the EA as a novel target for treating the stress, anxiety, and negative emotional state driving AUD.

Here, we measured circulating levels of several steroid hormones and performed whole-cell electrophysiological recordings from acutely prepared BNST slices of male rhesus monkeys allowed to self-administer alcohol for 12 months or a control solution. Initial comparisons revealed that BNST neurons in alcohol-drinking monkeys had decreased membrane resistance, increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) with no change in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs). We then used a combined variable cluster analysis and linear mixed model statistical approach to determine whether specific factors including stress and sex hormones, age and measures of alcohol consumption and intoxication are related to these BNST measures. Modeling results showed that specific measures of alcohol consumption and stress-related hormone levels predicted differences in membrane conductance in BNST neurons. Distinct groups of adrenal stress hormones were negatively associated with the frequency of sIPSCs and sEPSCs, and alcohol drinking measures and basal neuronal membrane properties were additional positive predictors of inhibitory, but not excitatory, PSCs. The amplitude of sEPSCs was highly positively correlated with age, independent of other variables. Together, these results suggest that chronic voluntary alcohol consumption strongly influences limbic function in non-human primates, potentially via interactions with or modulation by other physiological variables, including stress steroid hormones and age.",

abstract = "The United States is experiencing an opioid crisis imposing enormous fiscal and societal costs and driving the staggering overdose death rate. While prescription opioid analgesics are essential for treating acute pain, cessation of use in individuals with a physical dependence induces an aversive withdrawal syndrome that promotes continued drug use to alleviate/avoid these symptoms. Additionally, repeated bouts of withdrawal often lead to an increased propensity for relapse. Understanding the neurobiology underlying withdrawal is essential for providing novel treatment options to alleviate physiological and affective components accompanying the cessation of opiate use. Here, we administered morphine and precipitated withdrawal with naloxone to investigate behavioral and cellular responses in C57BL/6J male and female mice. Following 3 days of administration, both male and female mice demonstrated sensitized withdrawal symptoms. Since the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) plays a role in mediating withdrawal-associated behaviors, we examined plastic changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission within this structure 24 hours following the final precipitated withdrawal. In male mice, morphine withdrawal increased spontaneous GABAergic signaling compared with controls. In contrast, morphine withdrawal decreased spontaneous GABAergic signaling in female mice. Intriguingly, these opposing GABAergic effects were contingent upon activity-dependent dynamics within the ex vivo slice. Our findings suggest that male and female mice exhibit some divergent cellular responses in the BNST following morphine withdrawal, and alterations in BNST inhibitory signaling may contribute to the expression of behaviors following opioid withdrawal.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) is a complex limbic area involved in neuroendocrine and behavioural responses and, in particular, in the modulation of the stress response. BNST is innervated by dopamine and norepinephrine, which are known to be involved in drug addiction. It is also known that several drugs of abuse increase dopamine transmission in the BNST, but there has been less research regarding the effect on norepinephrine transmission. Here, we have used the microdialysis technique to investigate the effect of several drugs of abuse on norepinephrine transmission in the BNST of freely moving rats. We observed that nicotine (0.2-0.4 mg/kg), cocaine (2.5-5 mg/kg), amphetamine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg), and ethanol (0.5-1.0 g/kg), dose-dependently increased norepinephrine output while the effect of morphine at 3.0 was lower than that of 1.0 mg/kg. These results suggest that many drugs of abuse, though possessing diverse mechanisms of action, share the property of increasing norepinephrine transmission in the BNST. Furthermore, we suggest that the recurring activation of NE transmission in the BNST, due to drug administration, contributes to the alteration of the function that BNST assumes in how the behavioural response to stress manifests, favouring the establishment of the stress-induced drug seeking.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: To explore the effect of duration of epilepsy and delay in surgery on seizure outcome in patients operated for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). MATERIALS \& METHODS: A total of 664 consecutive patients who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) for TLE from 1995 to 2008 formed the study cohort. We divided them into two, one as seizure-free with or without antiepileptic drugs after ATL as ``good outcome'' (Engel class I a) and seizures of any type, any time after surgery as ``poor outcome.'' The probability of seizure freedom/seizure recurrence based on the duration of epilepsy was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves, univariate Cox regression survival analysis, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: A total of 136 children and 528 adults underwent ATL during this period. Mean duration of epilepsy pre-ATL was 17.1 + 9.4 years. At mean follow-up of 8.5 years, 331 patients (49.8\%) had good outcome and 333 (50.2\%) had poor outcome. The hazard of seizure recurrence linearly increased with duration of epilepsy pre-ATL, from 1.5 (duration of epilepsy, 5-10 years) to 1.9 (duration of epilepsy, 10-15 years) to 2 (duration of epilepsy over 15 years). In addition, encephalitis as antecedent, bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis in MRI, normal histopathology, and spikes in postoperative EEG at 3 months and 1 year predicted poor seizure outcome. CONCLUSIONS: ``Epilepsy duration'' independently predicted both short- and long-term seizure outcome after surgery in TLE. ``Lost years'' translate into poor seizure outcome after ATL. Therefore, all cases of drug-resistant TLE should be referred to a surgical center at the earliest.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is one of the most important direct epilepsy-related causes of death, with an incidence in adults of 1.2 per 1000 person years. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures have consistently emerged as the leading risk factor for SUDEP, particularly when such seizures are uncontrolled. High seizure burden, lack of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment, polytherapy, intellectual disability, and prone position at the time of death are other key risk factors. Unfortunately, despite advances in treatment, overall mortality rates in epilepsy are rising. It is imperative that we learn more about SUDEP so that effective prevention strategies can be implemented. To help identify persons at greater risk of SUDEP and in need of closer monitoring, biomarkers are needed. Candidate biomarkers include electrocardiographic, electroencephalographic, and imaging abnormalities observed more frequently in those who have died suddenly and unexpectedly. As our knowledge of the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind SUDEP have increased, various preventative measures have been proposed. These include lattice pillows, postictal oxygen therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and inhibitors of opiate and adenosine receptors. Unfortunately, no randomized clinical trials are available to definitively conclude these measures are effective. Rather, gaining the best control of seizures possible (with AEDs, devices, and resective surgery) still remains the intervention with the best evidence to reduce the risk of SUDEP. In this evidenced-based review, we explore the incidence of SUDEP and review the risk factors, biomarkers, and latest prevention strategies. This article is protected by copyright.

The objectives of this systematic analysis were to study the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of people with TLE with AE. Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline were searched using the keywords amygdala enlargement, temporal lobe epilepsy, epilepsy, and seizure in November 2020. We found 18 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 361 patients were included in this analysis. The mean age of onset was 36.2 years, and febrile seizure was uncommon compared to TLE with HS subjects. The type of aura and automatism was similar to TLE with HS, though less prevalent. Electroencephalography (EEG) was usually concordant with the side of AE. Anti-seizure medications (ASM), surgical, and immunotherapy were used in different studies. 86 patients underwent surgery with Engel I outcome in 69.7\%. Histopathology of the resected samples was predominantly dysplasia and gliosis. A group of patients that responded well to immunotherapy with subsequent reduction of amygdala volume (AMV) purported an autoimmune etiology of AE. Heterogeneity was the main drawback that prevented comparability among the studies. The methods of measurement of AMV also differed widely in the included studies, and standardization of its method is still lacking. This analysis suggests TLE with AE as a distinctive group of patients either due to a developmental anomaly or autoimmune etiology.",

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is thought to be related to peri-ictal cardiac dysfunction, respiratory depression, and autonomic dysfunction, albeit the exact etiology is unknown. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy prevention remains a huge challenge. The sole presence and frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) are the most important risk factors for SUDEP, and nocturnal monitoring may lower the risk with the use of remote listening devices. In addition, studies in animal models of SUDEP have discovered that multiple neurotransmitters, including serotonin (5-HT) and adenosine, may be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of SUDEP and that these neurotransmitters could be the targets of future pharmacological intervention for SUDEP. The latest research findings on the epidemiology, clinical risk factors, and probable causes of SUDEP are presented in this review.",

abstract = "Inherited heart disease causing electric instability in the heart has been suggested to be a risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The purpose of this study was to reveal the correlation between epilepsy-related sudden unexpected death (SUD) and inherited heart disease. Twelve epilepsy-related SUD cases (seven males and five females, aged 11-78 years) were examined. Nine cases fulfilled the criteria of SUDEP, and three cases died by drowning. In addition to examining three major epilepsy-related genes, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to examine 73 inherited heart disease-related genes. We detected both known pathogenic variants and rare variants with minor allele frequencies of <0.5\%. The pathogenicity of these variants was evaluated and graded by eight in silico predictive algorithms. Six known and six potential rare variants were detected. Among these, three known variants of LDB3, DSC2 and KCNE1 and three potential rare variants of MYH6, DSP and DSG2 were predicted by in silico analysis as possibly highly pathogenic in three of the nine SUDEP cases. Two of three cases with desmosome-related variants showed mild but possible significant right ventricular dysplasia-like pathology. A case with LDB3 and MYH6 variants showed hypertrabeculation of the left ventricle and severe fibrosis of the cardiac conduction system. In the three drowning death cases, one case with mild prolonged QT interval had two variants in ANK2. This study shows that inherited heart disease may be a significant risk factor for SUD in some epilepsy cases, even if pathological findings of the heart had not progressed to an advanced stage of the disease. A combination of detailed pathological examination of the heart and gene analysis using NGS may be useful for evaluating arrhythmogenic potential of epilepsy-related SUD.

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is mechanistically complex and one probable cause is seizure-related respiratory dysfunction. Medullary respiratory regulatory nuclei include the pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex (pre-B{\"o}tC) in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM), the medullary raph{\'e} nuclei (MR) and nucleus of solitary tract in the dorsomedial medulla (DMM). The region of the VLM also contains intermingled tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catecholaminergic neurones which directly project to the pre-B{\"o}tC and regulate breathing under hypoxic conditions and our aim was to evaluate these neurones in SUDEP cases. In post-mortem cases from three groups [SUDEP (18), epilepsy controls (8) and non-epilepsy controls (16)] serial sections of medulla (obex +2 to +13 mm) were immunolabelled for TH. Three regions of interest (ROI) were outlined (VLM, DMM and MR) and TH-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurones evaluated using automated detection for overall labelling index (neurones and processes) and neuronal densities and compared between groups and relative to obex level. C-fos immunoreactivity was also semi-quantitatively evaluated in these regions. We found no significant difference in the density of TH-IR neurones or labelling index between the groups in all regions. Significantly more TH-IR neurones were present in the DMM region than VLM in non-epilepsy cases only (p<0.01). Regional variations in TH-IR neurones with obex level was seen in all groups except SUDEP. We also identified occasional TH neurones in the MR region in all groups. There was significantly less c-fos labelling in the VLM and MR in SUDEP than non-epilepsy controls but no difference with epilepsy controls. In conclusion, in this series we found no evidence for alteration of total medullary TH-IR neuronal numbers in SUDEP but noted some differences in their relative distribution in the medulla and c-fos neurones compared to control groups which may be relevant to the mechanism of death.",

Reduced medullary serotonergic neurones, modulators of respiration in response to hypercapnia, were reported in a SUDEP post-mortem series. The amygdala and hippocampus have high serotonergic innervation and are functionally implicated in seizure-related respiratory dysregulation. We explored serotonergic networks in mesial temporal lobe structures in a surgical and post-mortem epilepsy series in relation to SUDEP risk. We stratified 75 temporal lobe epilepsy patients with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE/HS) into high (N = 16), medium (N = 11) and low risk (N = 48) groups for SUDEP based on generalised seizure frequency. We also included the amygdala in 35 post-mortem cases, including SUDEP (N = 17), epilepsy controls (N = 10) and non-epilepsy controls (N = 8). The immunohistochemistry labelling index (LI) and axonal length (AL) of serotonin transporter (SERT)-positive axons were quantified in 13 regions of interest with image analysis. SERT LI was highest in amygdala and subiculum regions. In the surgical series, higher SERT LI was observed in high risk than low risk cases in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and subiculum (p < 0.05). In the post-mortem cases higher SERT LI and AL was observed in the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala and peri-amygdala cortex in SUDEP compared to epilepsy controls (p < 0.05). Patients on SRI showed higher SERT in the dentate gyrus (p < 0.005) and CA4 (p < 0.05) but there was no difference in patients with or without a psychiatric history. Higher SERT in hippocampal subfields in TLE/HS cases with SUDEP risk factors and higher amygdala SERT in post-mortem SUDEP cases than epilepsy controls supports a role for altered serotonergic networks involving limbic regions in SUDEP. This may be of functional relevance through reduced 5-HT availability.",

abstract = "There is a high incidence of psychiatric comorbidity in people with epilepsy (PWE), particularly depression. The manifold adverse consequences of comorbid depression have been more clearly mapped in recent years. Accordingly, considerable efforts have been made to improve detection and diagnosis, with the result that many PWE are treated with antidepressant drugs, medications with the potential to influence both epilepsy and depression. Exposure to older generations of antidepressants (notably tricyclic antidepressants and bupropion) can increase seizure frequency. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that newer ('second generation') antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, have markedly less effect on excitability and may lead to improvements in epilepsy severity. Although a great deal is known about how antidepressants affect excitability on short time scales in experimental models, little is known about the effects of chronic antidepressant exposure on the underlying processes subsumed under the term 'epileptogenesis': the progressive neurobiological processes by which the non-epileptic brain changes so that it generates spontaneous, recurrent seizures. This paper reviews the literature concerning the influences of antidepressants in PWE and in animal models. The second section describes neurobiological mechanisms implicated in both antidepressant actions and in epileptogenesis, highlighting potential substrates that may mediate any effects of antidepressants on the development and progression of epilepsy. Although much indirect evidence suggests the overall clinical effects of antidepressants on epilepsy itself are beneficial, there are reasons for caution and the need for further research, discussed in the concluding section.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dravet syndrome is a severe, genetic form of paediatric epilepsy associated with premature mortality and co-morbidities such as anxiety, depression, autism, motor dysfunction and memory deficits. Cannabidiol is an approved anticonvulsive drug in the United States and Europe for seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older. We investigated its potential to prevent premature mortality and improve associated co-morbidities. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The efficacy of sub-chronic cannabidiol administration in two mouse models of Dravet syndrome was investigated. The effect of cannabidiol on neonatal welfare and survival was studied using Scn1a-/- mice. We then used a hybrid, heterozygote Scn1a+/- mouse model to study the effect of cannabidiol on survival and behavioural co-morbidities: motor deficits (rotarod and static-beam test), gait abnormality (gait test), social anxiety (social interaction test), anxiety-like (elevated plus maze) and depressive-like behaviours (sucrose preference test) and cognitive impairment (radial arm maze test). KEY RESULTS: In Scn1a-/- mice, cannabidiol increased survival and delayed worsening of neonatal welfare. In Scn1a+/- mice, chronic cannabidiol administration did not show any adverse effect on motor function and gait, reduced premature mortality, improved social behaviour and memory function, and reduced anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviours. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We are the first to demonstrate a potential disease-modifying effect of cannabidiol in animal models of Dravet syndrome. Cannabidiol treatment reduced premature mortality and improved several behavioural co-morbidities in Dravet syndrome mice. These crucial findings may be translated into human therapy to address behavioural co-morbidities associated with Dravet syndrome.",

Despite over 50 million people being affected worldwide, only ~70\% of people with epilepsy have their seizures successfully controlled with current pharmacotherapy, and many experience significant psychiatric and physical comorbidities. Adenosine, a ubiquitous purine metabolite, is a potent endogenous anti-epileptic substance that can abolish seizure activity via the adenosine A1 G protein-coupled receptor (A1 R). A1 R activation decreases seizure activity in animal models, including models of drug-resistant epilepsy. Recent advances have increased our understanding of epilepsy comorbidities, highlighting the potential for adenosine receptors to modulate epilepsy-associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular dysfunction, sleep, and cognition.

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often suffer from comorbid psychiatric diagnoses such as depression, anxiety, or impaired cognitive performance. Endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling is a key regulator of synaptic neurotransmission and has been implicated in the mechanisms of epilepsy as well as several mood disorders and cognitive impairments. AIMS: We employed a pilocarpine model of TLE in C57/BJ mice to investigate the role of eCB signaling in epileptogenesis and concomitant psychiatric comorbidities. METHODS AND RESULTS: We sought to alter the neuronal levels of a known eCB receptor ligand, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), through the use of RHC80267 or JZL184. Pilocarpine-treated mice were treated with RHC80267 (1.3 $\mu$mol) or JZL184 (20 mg/kg) immediately after the termination of status epilepticus (SE), which was followed by daily treatment for the next 7 days. Our results indicated that RHC80267 treatment significantly reduced the percentage of mice suffering from spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in addition to decreasing the duration of observed seizures when compared to vehicle treatment. Furthermore, RHC80267 attenuated depression and anxiety-related behaviors, improved previously impaired spatial learning and memory, and inhibited seizure-induced hippocampal neuronal loss during the chronic epileptic period. In contrast, JZL184 administration markedly increased the frequency and the duration of observed SRS, enhanced the previously impaired neuropsychological performance, and increased hippocampal damage following SE. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that RHC80267 treatment after the onset of SE could result in an amelioration of the effects found during the chronic epileptic period and yield an overall decrease in epileptic symptoms and comorbid conditions. Thus, alterations to endocannabinoid signaling may serve as a potential mechanism to prevent epileptogenesis and manipulation of this signaling pathway as a possible drug target.",

abstract = "AIMS: Epilepsy, frequently comorbid with depression, easily develops drug resistance. Here, we investigated how dorsal raphe (DR) and its 5-HTergic neurons are implicated in epilepsy. METHODS: In mouse hippocampal kindling model, using immunochemistry, calcium fiber photometry, and optogenetics, we investigated the causal role of DR 5-HTergic neurons in seizure of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Further, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the DR with different frequencies was applied to test its effect on hippocampal seizure and depressive-like behavior. RESULTS: Number of c-fos+ neurons in the DR and calcium activities of DR 5-HTergic neurons were both increased during kindling-induced hippocampal seizures. Optogenetic inhibition, but not activation, of DR 5-HTergic neurons conspicuously retarded seizure acquisition specially during the late period. For clinical translation, 1-Hz-specific, but not 20-Hz or 100-Hz, DBS of the DR retarded the acquisition of hippocampal seizure. This therapeutic effect may be mediated by the inhibition of DR 5-HTergic neurons, as optogenetic activation of DR 5-HTergic neurons reversed the anti-seizure effects of 1-Hz DR DBS. However, DBS treatment had no effect on depressive-like behavior. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of hyperactivity of DR 5-HTergic neuron may present promising anti-seizure effect and the DR may be a potential DBS target for the therapy of TLE.",

Rodent models of epilepsy are used to characterize the comorbid symptoms apparent in epilepsy and their neurobiological mechanisms. The present study was designed to assess Pavlovian fear conditioning and latent inhibition in a polygenetic rat model of absence epilepsy, i.e. Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and the non-epileptic control (NEC) strain. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed the presence of spike-wave discharges in young adult GAERS but not NEC rats. A series of behavioural tests designed to assess anxiety-like behaviour (elevated plus maze, open field, acoustic startle response) and cognition (Pavlovian conditioning and latent inhibition) was subsequently conducted on male and female offspring. Results showed that GAERS exhibited significantly higher anxiety-like behaviour, a characteristic reported previously. In addition, using two protocols that differed in shock intensity, we found that both sexes of GAERS displayed exaggerated cued and contextual Pavlovian fear conditioning and impaired fear extinction. Fear reinstatement to the conditioned stimuli following unsignalled footshocks did not differ between the strains. Male GAERS also showed impaired latent inhibition in a paradigm using Pavlovian fear conditioning, suggesting that they may have altered attention, particularly related to previously irrelevant stimuli in the environment. Neither the female GAERS nor NEC rats showed evidence of latent inhibition in our paradigm. Together, the results suggest that GAERS may be a particularly useful model for assessing therapeutics designed to improve the emotional and cognitive disturbances associated with absence epilepsy.",

Because fear learning and anxiety states can be expressed differently between rats and mice, we compared the functional connectivity between amBNST and the VTA-DA neurons in both species using consistent methodological approaches. Using a combination of in vivo electrophysiological, neuroanatomical tracing and laser capture approaches we explored the BNST influences on VTA-DA neuron activity. First, we characterised in rats the molecular phenotype of the amBNST neurons projecting to the VTA. We found that this projection is complex, including both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. Then, VTA injections of a conventional retrograde tracer, the $\beta$-sub-unit of the cholera toxin (CTB), revealed a stronger BNST-VTA projection in mice than in rats. Finally, electrical stimulations of the BNST during VTA-DA neuron recording demonstrated a more potent excitatory influence of the amBNST on VTA-DA neuron activity in rats than in mice. These data illustrate anatomically, but also functionally, a significant difference between rats and mice in the amBNST-VTA pathway. More generally, together with previous findings, our research highlights the importance of species differences for the interpretation and the generalisation of research data.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA) comprise a forebrain unit that has been described as the ``extended amygdala''. These two nuclei send dense projections to each other and have been implicated in the regulation of negative emotional states, including anxiety and fear. The present study employed an optogenetic technique to examine whether stimulation of CeA-projecting dorsolateral BNST (dlBNST) neuron terminals would influence anxiety-like behaviors in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Photostimulation of CeA-projecting dlBNST neuron terminals produced anxiogenic effects in an elevated plus maze test. This finding is inconsistent with previous reports showing that optogenetic stimulation of BNST neurons projecting to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) produces anxiolytic rather than anxiogenic effects. To address this issue, electrophysiological analyses were conducted to characterize dlBNST neurons projecting to the CeA, LH, and VTA. dlBNST neurons can be electrophysiologically classified into three distinct cell types (types I-III) according to their responses to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injections. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that more than 60\% of the CeA-projecting dlBNST neurons were type II, whereas approximately 80\% of the LH- and VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons were type III. These electrophysiological results will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of BNST neurons during the regulation of anxiety-like behaviors.",

abstract = "Mutations in the SCN1A gene encoding the Nav1.1 sodium channel cause several forms of epilepsy, the most severe is Dravet syndrome (DS). DS patients are at high risk for sudden death and seizures are often triggered by fever or hyperthermia. To improve understanding of how serotonergic ligands might influence DS in this study, we tested several drugs for their effect on hyperthermia-induced seizure using a mouse model of DS consisting of a heterozygous loss of function of Scn1A. We found that a mixed 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist had no effect while a mixed 5-HT1B/D receptor agonist had a modest effect reducing the severity of seizures. Hypothesizing selective agonists may be more effective, we tested selective 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor agonists, CP-93129 and GR-46611, respectively. Of these GR-46611 significantly increased the threshold of hyperthermia-induced seizure and lowered seizure severity. Given chronically at 1 mg kg-1 day-1 , GR-46611 also significantly improved survival of DS mice. Thus, 5-HT1D -receptors may represent a meaningful target for pharmacotherapy for DS with potential relevance for related forms of epilepsy, particularly those with a known sensory trigger such as heat.",

Its function is dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders that are characterized by stress- or drug-induced alterations in mood, arousal, motivation, and social behavior. However, compared to the BNST's role in mood, arousal, and motivation, its role in social behavior has remained relatively understudied. Moreover, the precise cell types and circuits underlying the BNST's role in social behavior have only recently begun to be explored using modern neuroscience techniques. Here, we systematically review the existing literature investigating the neurobiological substrates within the BNST that contribute to the coordination of various sex-dependent and sex-independent social behavioral repertoires, focusing largely on pharmacological and circuit-based behavioral studies in rodents. We suggest that the BNST coordinates social behavior by promoting appropriate assessment of social contexts to select relevant behavioral outputs and that disruption of socially relevant BNST systems by stress and drugs of abuse may be an important factor in the development of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a focal point for the convergence of inputs from canonical stress-sensitive structures to fine-tune the response to stress. However, its role in mediating phenotypes of stress resilience or susceptibility is yet to be fully defined. In this study, we carried out unbiased RNA-sequencing to analyse the BNST transcriptomes of adult male mice, which were classified as resilient or susceptible following a 10-day chronic psychosocial defeat stress paradigm. Pairwise comparisons revealed 20 differentially expressed genes in resilience (6) and susceptible (14) mice compared with controls. An in silico validation of our data against an earlier study revealed significant concordance in gene expression profiles associated with resilience to chronic stress. Enrichment analysis revealed that resilience is linked to functions including retinoic acid hydrolase activity, phospholipase inhibitor and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor activities, whereas susceptibility is linked to alterations in amino acid transporter activity. We also identified differential usage of 134 exons across 103 genes associated with resilience and susceptibility; enrichment analysis for genes with differential exon usage in resilient mice was linked to functions including adrenergic receptor binding mice and oxysterol binding in susceptible mice. Our findings highlight the important and underappreciated role of the BNST in stress resilience and susceptibility and reveal research avenues for follow-up investigations.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Data on epilepsy in dementia, particularly on its risk factors, are scarce. Confounding comorbidities and the rising incidence of epilepsy in older age have hampered studies in this field. The occurrence and risk factors for epilepsy in the Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem), a large cohort of patients with dementia, have been examined. METHODS: Information on epilepsy and seizure-related diagnoses, comorbidities and survival were extracted for all individuals in SveDem (n = 81 192) and three randomly selected age- and gender-matched controls from the population register, excluding all with a dementia diagnosis (n = 223 933). The risk of epilepsy following dementia diagnosis was estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to identify risk factors and adjust for comorbidities. RESULTS: A diagnosis of epilepsy was found more frequently amongst dementia patients [4.0\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.8-4.1] than controls (1.9\%, 95\% CI 1.9-2.0). The risk of incident epilepsy after dementia was 2.1\% (95\% CI 1.9-2.3) at 5 years and 4.0\% (95\%CI 3.4-4.6) at 10 years, compared to 0.8\% (95\% CI 0.8-0.8) and 1.6\% (95\% CI 1.4-1.8) respectively for controls. The risk was greatest for early-onset Alzheimer's disease. In multivariate analysis, dementia was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.52 (95\% CI 2.31-2.74) for epilepsy. Young age, male sex, stroke, brain trauma, brain tumour and low Mini-Mental State Examination score significantly increased the risk. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia, particularly young-onset Alzheimer's disease, increases the risk of subsequent epilepsy. Further studies are needed to determine optimal management and the impact of epilepsy on prognosis.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ictal respiratory disturbances have increasingly been reported, in both generalized and focal seizures, especially involving the temporal lobe. Recognition of ictal breathing impairment has gained importance for the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of ictal apnea (IA) and related hypoxemia during seizures. METHODS: We collected and analyzed electroclinical data from consecutive patients undergoing long-term video-electroencephalographic (video-EEG) monitoring with cardiorespiratory polygraphy. Patients were recruited at the epilepsy monitoring unit of the Civil Hospital of Baggiovara, Modena Academic Hospital, from April 2020 to February 2022. RESULTS: A total of 552 seizures were recorded in 63 patients. IA was observed in 57 of 552 (10.3\%) seizures in 16 of 63 (25.4\%) patients. Thirteen (81.2\%) patients had focal seizures, and 11 of 16 patients showing IA had a diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy; two had a diagnosis of frontal lobe epilepsy and three of epileptic encephalopathy. Apnea agnosia was reported in all seizure types. Hypoxemia was observed in 25 of 57 (43.9\%) seizures with IA, and the severity of hypoxemia was related to apnea duration. Apnea duration was significantly associated with epilepsy of unknown etiology (magnetic resonance imaging negative) and with older age at epilepsy onset (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ictal respiratory changes are a frequent clinical phenomenon, more likely to occur in focal epilepsies, although detected even in patients with epileptic encephalopathy. Our findings emphasize the need for respiratory polygraphy during long-term video-EEG monitoring for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, as well as in relation to the potential link of ictal apnea with the SUDEP risk.",

METHODS: A case-control study was conducted including (i) definite or probable SUDEP cases collected by the French National Sentinel Mortality Epilepsy Network and (ii) control patients from the French national research database of epilepsy monitoring units. Patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were eligible. Multiple logistic regressions were performed. After sensitivity analysis and internal validation, a simplified risk score was developed from the selected variables. RESULTS: Sixty-two SUDEP cases and 620 controls were included. Of 21 potential predictors explored, seven were ultimately selected, including generalized seizure frequency (>1/month vs. <1/year: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.6, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-5.41), nocturnal or sleep-related seizures (AOR 4.49, 95\% CI 2.68-7.53), current or past depression (AOR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.19-3.34) or the ability to alert someone of an oncoming seizure (AOR 0.57, 95\% CI 0.33-0.98). After internal validation, a clinically usable score ranging from -1 to 8 was developed, with high discrimination capabilities (area under the receiver operating curve 0.85, 95\% CI 0.80-0.90). The threshold of 3 has good sensitivity (82.3\%, 95\% CI 72.7-91.8), whilst keeping a good specificity (82.7\%, 95\% CI 79.8-85.7). CONCLUSIONS: These results outline the importance of generalized and nocturnal seizures on the occurrence of SUDEP, and show a protective role in the ability to alert someone of an oncoming seizure.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a sudden, unexpected death in people with epilepsy, with or without evidence of an epileptic seizure. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying SUDEP appears to be partly associated with an autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is a reliable, non-invasive method for detecting fluctuations in the ANS. In this systematic review we analyzed the data available in the literature on changes in HRV parameters in patients with SUDEP. METHODS: We carried out a systematic search of the literature to identify the quantitative variations of HRV in epileptic patients with SUDEP. The following databases were used: Pubmed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and CrossRef. A pooled analysis was carried out, and the results obtained were compared using mean difference (MD). The review was registered on the PROSPERO platform (CRD42021291586). RESULTS: Seven articles were included, with a total of 72 SUDEP cases associated with altered HRV parameters. Generally, a reduction of SDNN (standard deviation of the RR intervals) and RMSSD (root mean square differences of successive RR intervals) was reported in most SUDEP patients. According to MD, the SUDEP patients showed no differences in time and frequency domain parameters compared to controls. However, a trend toward increased low frequency and high frequency ratio (LF/HF) was observed in the SUDEP patients. CONCLUSIONS: HRV analysis is a valuable method for assessing cardiovascular risk and cardioautonomic impairment. Although a possible association between HRV variation and SUDEP has been reported, further studies are needed to assess the potential role of HRV modifications as a SUDEP biomarker.",

It has recently been suggested that presence and duration of PGES might be a predictor of SUDEP risk. Little is known about the etiology of PGES. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study in 50 people with convulsive seizures (CS) recorded on digital video-electroencephalography (EEG). One CS per individual was reviewed for presence and duration of PGES by two independent observers: Preictal and postictal heart rate (HR) (1 min before seizure onset and 1, 3, 5, 15, and 30 min after seizure end) and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV), including the ratio of low frequency (LF) versus high frequency (HF) power, were analyzed. The relationship between PGES and periictal autonomic changes was evaluated, as well as its association with several clinical variables. KEY FINDINGS: Thirty-seven individuals (74\%) exhibited PGES and 13 (26\%) did not. CS resulted in a significant increase of periictal HR and the LF/HF ratio. PGES was associated with neither periictal HR (mean HR difference between PGES+ and PGES- seizures: -2 beats per minute [bpm], 95\% confidence interval [CI] -10 to +6 bpm) nor HRV change. There was no association between the duration of PGES and periictal HR change. People with PGES were more likely to be asleep before seizure onset (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95\% CI 1.2-18.3) and had a higher age of onset of epilepsy (median age 15 vs. 4 years).

abstract = "PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, duration, risk factors for, and clinical correlates of postictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES), and to further delineate the significance of PGES in the pathogenesis of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the video-EEG studies of 109 consecutive patients with 151 generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) during video-EEG monitoring. We determined the incidence, duration, and clinical correlates of PGES. We also investigated whether factors such as age, sex, seizure type, total seizure duration, and duration of tonic and clonic phases influenced PGES. KEY FINDINGS: PGES was observed in 64 (58.7\%) of 109 patients and in 98 (64.9\%) of 151 GCS. Average duration of PGES was 42.4 $\pm$ 19.1 s. Statistical analysis showed that patients with PGES had no difference in age, gender, total seizure duration, total convulsive duration, clonic phase, seizure type, and seizure termination, as compared to those without PGES. However, tonic phase was significantly prolonged in patients with PGES than in those without PGES (p = 0.00086). A 1 s increase in tonic phase duration was associated with a 0.06 increase in log odds of PGES (odds ratio = 1.1, p = 0.00055). Clinically, 95.3\% patients were unresponsive or immobile during PGES, whereas only 26.7\% patients without PGES were unresponsive or immobile immediately after seizure termination. SIGNIFICANCE: PGES is a common EEG pattern of GCS. Tonic phase of GCS is an independent predictor of PGES, which is well correlated with postictal unresponsiveness or immobile, and may play a significant role in the mechanism of SUDEP.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: Antibodies against neuronal surface proteins are increasingly recognized in autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) disorders in which seizures are the main or an important feature. The disorders include antibody-associated limbic encephalitis and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis; however, seizures of autoimmune etiology may exist beyond the spectrum of these recognized syndromes. Because these seizures are potentially treatable with immune therapy, guidelines are needed to help in their early recognition. METHODS: We describe 13 representative children seen at our tertiary institution over a period of 3.5 years with suspected autoimmune epilepsy. Autoimmune epilepsy was suspected clinically when there was any of the following: (1) recognizable syndromes such as NMDAR encephalitis or limbic encephalitis, (2) evidence of CNS inflammation in cerebrospinal fluid or on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (3) the presence of other autoimmune diseases, or (4) positive response to immunotherapy. We tested these patients for neuronal surface antibodies (voltage gated potassium channel [VGKC]-complex, leucine rich glioma inactivated 1 [LGI1], contactin-associated protein-like 2 [CASPR2], and NMDAR) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. We modified the J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 83, 2012, 638 guidelines that were designed to classify adults with neuronal surface antibody syndromes (NSAS), to be more appropriate for children with suspected autoimmune epilepsy. Using the modified guidelines, the 13 patients were classified into definite, probable, possible, unlikely, or unknown autoimmune epilepsy according to the presence of neuronal surface or GAD antibodies, and the response to immune therapy when given. KEY FINDINGS: Of the 13 patients, 11 were females, and the mean age was 6 years (range 1-13 years). Three patients had classical NMDAR encephalitis, two had VGKC encephalitis, two had limbic encephalitis with negative antibodies, three had epilepsy with other autoimmune diseases (one with high titer GAD antibodies), two had fever-induced refractory epileptic encephalopathy in school-aged children (FIRES), and one epileptic encephalopathy associated with VGKC antibodies. Seven patients of the 13 children with suspected autoimmune epilepsy were positive for neuronal surface antibodies (NMDAR, n = 3; VGKC-complex, n = 3; and GAD, n = 1). Immunotherapy was given to nine cases, and a positive response was more common in patients with positive neuronal surface antibodies (5/5) compared to those with negative antibodies (2/4). Applying the proposed guidelines, the classification of autoimmune epilepsy was definite in five, probable in one, possible in three, unlikely in two, and unknown in two patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Neuronal surface antibodies and GAD antibodies are present in a proportion of children with suspected autoimmune epilepsy and may define a treatable subgroup of childhood epilepsy. The proposed guidelines can be useful in the recognition of children with seizures of autoimmune etiology.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To develop a constitutively active K(+) leak channel using TREK-1 (TWIK-related potassium channel 1; TREK-M) that is resistant to compensatory down-regulation by second messenger cascades, and to validate the ability of TREK-M to silence hyperactive neurons using cultured hippocampal neurons. To test if adenoassociated viral (AAV) delivery of TREK-M could reduce the duration of status epilepticus and reduce neuronal death induced by lithium-pilocarpine administration. METHODS: Molecular cloning techniques were used to engineer novel vectors to deliver TREK-M via plasmids, lentivirus, and AAV using a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-enhanced GABRA4 promoter. Electrophysiology was used to characterize the activity and regulation of TREK-M in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, and the ability to reduce spontaneous activity in cultured hippocampal neurons. Adult male rats were injected bilaterally with self-complementary AAV particles composed of serotype 5 capsid into the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Lithium-pilocarpine was used to induce status epilepticus. Seizures were monitored using continuous video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. Neuronal death was measured using Fluoro-Jade C staining of paraformaldehyde-fixed brain slices. RESULTS: TREK-M inhibited neuronal firing by hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential and decreasing input resistance. AAV delivery of TREK-M decreased the duration of status epilepticus by 50\%. Concomitantly it reduced neuronal death in areas targeted by the AAV injection. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that TREK-M can silence hyperexcitable neurons in the brain of epileptic rats and treat acute seizures. This study paves the way for an alternative gene therapy treatment of status epilepticus, and provides the rationale for studies of AAV-TREK-M's effect on spontaneous seizures in chronic models of temporal lobe epilepsy.",

Children with SMEI have febrile and afebrile seizures (FS and aFS), ataxia, and social and cognitive dysfunctions. SMEI is pharmacologically intractable and can be fatal in 10-20\% of patients. It remains to be elucidated how channelopathies that cause SMEI impact synaptic activities in key neural circuits, and there is an ongoing critical need for alternative methods of controlling seizures in SMEI. Using the SCN1A gene knock-in mouse model of SMEI (mSMEI), we studied hippocampal cell and circuit excitability, particularly during hyperthermia, and tested whether an adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) agonist can reliably control hippocampal circuit hyperexcitability. METHODS: Using a combination of electrophysiology (extracellular and whole-cell voltage clamp) and fast voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI), we quantified synaptic excitation and inhibition, spatiotemporal characteristics of neural circuit activity, and hyperthermia-induced febrile seizure-like events (FSLEs) in juvenile mouse hippocampal slices. We used hyperthermia to elicit FSLEs in hippocampal slices, while making use of adenosine A1R agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) to control abnormally widespread neural activity and FSLEs. RESULTS: We discovered a significant excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance in mSMEI hippocampi, in which inhibition was decreased and excitation increased. This imbalance was associated with an increased spatial extent of evoked neural circuit activation and a lowered FSLE threshold. We found that a low concentration (50 nm) of CPA blocked FSLEs and reduced the spatial extent of abnormal neural activity spread while preserving basal levels of excitatory synaptic transmission. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study reveals significant hippocampal synapse and circuit dysfunctions in mSMEI and demonstrates that the A1R agonist CPA can reliably control hippocampal hyperexcitability and FSLEs in vitro. These findings may warrant further investigations of purinergic agonists as part of the development of new therapeutic approaches for Dravet syndrome.",

However, the sensitivity and clinical utility of diagnostic panels based solely on established cardiac arrhythmia genes in the molecular autopsy of SUDEP is unknown. We applied the established clinical diagnostic panels, followed by sequencing and a high density copy number variant (CNV) detection array of an additional 253 related ion channel subunit genes to analyze the overall genomic variation in a SUDEP of the 3-year-old proband with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI). We uncovered complex combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms and CNVs in genes expressed in both neurocardiac and respiratory control pathways, including SCN1A, KCNA1, RYR3, and HTR2C. Our findings demonstrate the importance of comprehensive high-resolution variant analysis in the assessment of personally relevant SUDEP risk. In this case, the combination of de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CNVs in the SCN1A and KCNA1 genes, respectively, is suspected to be the principal risk factor for both epilepsy and premature death. However, consideration of the overall biologically relevant variant complexity with its extensive functional epistatic interactions reveals potential personal risk more accurately.",

Despite recent advances in the cellular and molecular biology of these conditions, the pathogenetic mechanisms of FCDs remain largely unknown. The purpose if this work is to review the molecular underpinnings of FCDs and to highlight potential therapeutic targets. A systematic review of the literature regarding the histologic, molecular, and electrophysiologic aspects of FCDs was conducted. Disruption of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling comprises a common pathway underlying the structural and electrical disturbances of some FCDs. Other mechanisms such as viral infections, prematurity, head trauma, and brain tumors are also posited. mTOR inhibitors (i.e., rapamycin) have shown positive results on seizure management in animal models and in a small cohort of patients with FCD. Encouraging progress has been achieved on the molecular and electrophysiologic basis of constitutive cells in the dysplastic tissue. Despite the promising results of mTOR inhibitors, large-scale randomized trials are in need to evaluate their efficacy and side effects, along with additional mechanistic studies for the development of novel, molecular-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

author = "Brunklaus, Andreas and Zuberi, Sameer M",
abstract = "Mutations in the gene encoding the $\alpha$1 subunit of the voltage gated sodium channel (SCN1A) are associated with several epilepsy syndromes, ranging from relatively mild phenotypes found in families with genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) to the severe infant-onset epilepsy Dravet syndrome. Evidence has emerged of the consequences of SCN1$\alpha$ dysfunction in different neuronal networks across the brain pointing toward a channelopathy model causing the neurologic features of Dravet syndrome that is beyond purely seizure related damage. A genetic change will present according to its severity, the genetic background of the individual, and environmental factors, and will affect a variety of neuronal networks according to channel distribution. This already-vulnerable system may be susceptible to secondary aggravating events such as status epilepticus. The channelopathy model implies that pharmacologic treatment and the restoration of impaired $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission might not only help prevent seizures but might affect the comorbidities of the syndrome. This critical review explores recent evidence relating to the pathogenicity of SCN1A mutations in Dravet syndrome and the effect these have on the wider disease phenotype and discusses whether knowledge of specific genotypes can influence clinical practice. Genetic technology is currently advancing at unprecedented speed and will increase our knowledge of new genes and interacting genetic networks. Clinicians and geneticists will have to work in close collaboration to guarantee good delivery and counseling of genetic testing results.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Evidence from basic neurophysiology and molecular genetics has implicated persistent sodium current conducted by voltage-gated sodium (NaV ) channels as a contributor to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Many antiepileptic drugs target NaV channels and modulate neuronal excitability, mainly by a use-dependent block of transient sodium current, although suppression of persistent current may also contribute to the efficacy of these drugs. We hypothesized that a drug or compound capable of preferential inhibition of persistent sodium current would have antiepileptic activity. METHODS: We examined the antiepileptic activity of two selective persistent sodium current blockers ranolazine, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for treatment of angina pectoris, and GS967, a novel compound with more potent effects on persistent current, in the epileptic Scn2a(Q54) mouse model. We also examined the effect of GS967 in the maximal electroshock model and evaluated effects of the compound on neuronal excitability, propensity for hilar neuron loss, development of mossy fiber sprouting, and survival of Scn2a(Q54) mice. RESULTS: We found that ranolazine was capable of reducing seizure frequency by approximately 50\% in Scn2a(Q54) mice. The more potent persistent current blocker GS967 reduced seizure frequency by >90\% in Scn2a(Q54) mice and protected against induced seizures in the maximal electroshock model. GS967 greatly attenuated abnormal spontaneous action potential firing in pyramidal neurons acutely isolated from Scn2a(Q54) mice. In addition to seizure suppression in vivo, GS967 treatment greatly improved the survival of Scn2a(Q54) mice, prevented hilar neuron loss, and suppressed the development of hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that the selective persistent sodium current blocker GS967 has potent antiepileptic activity and that this compound could inform development of new agents.",

In this systematic review, we seek to summarize the incidence of SUDEP and its age distribution, as well as the years of potential life lost and cumulative risks of SUDEP for persons with epilepsy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for epidemiologic studies of sudden death in epilepsy and rated their quality of evidence. We pooled data from comparable higher quality population-based studies of SUDEP incidence across all age groups, calculating the overall incidence of SUDEP per 100,000 population, and per 1,000 people with epilepsy. Using standard formulas, we also calculated the years of potential life lost and cumulative risks associated with SUDEP. RESULTS: SUDEP has an estimated overall crude annual incidence rate of 0.81 cases per 100,000 population, or 1.16 cases per 1,000 patients with epilepsy. Comparing years of potential life lost from SUDEP with selected other neurologic diseases, SUDEP ranks second only to stroke. SIGNIFICANCE: Despite limitations to the data on which our analysis is based, we conclude that the public health burden of SUDEP, which has previously been underappreciated, is substantial and deserves much more attention from clinicians, researchers, and the public health community.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Describe the characteristics of persons with epilepsy (PWEs) and caregivers that have or have not heard of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) prior to completing a survey through the Internet or in the clinical setting. METHODS: An online survey for adult PWEs and caregivers was solicited by e-mail and newsletter to Epilepsy Therapy Project members. A similar survey was implemented in a clinic setting of a community hospital. The survey asked about seizure characteristics, epilepsy management, fear of death, and familiarity with the term SUDEP. Respondents that never heard of SUDEP read a definition and responded to questions about their initial reactions. RESULTS: Surveys from 1,392 PWEs and 611 caregivers recruited through an epilepsy Website and a clinic demonstrated that Internet respondents were much more likely to have heard about SUDEP than the clinic population (71.1\% vs. 38.8\%; p < 0.001), and caregivers of PWEs were more likely to have heard about SUDEP than PWEs (76.2\% vs. 65.2\%; p < 0.001). Prior awareness was related to an increased level of education, more severe and longer duration of epilepsy, and having an epileptologist as the primary care provider. Although most PWEs and caregivers reported feelings of fear, anxiety, and sadness after first hearing of SUDEP, they wanted to discuss it with their doctor. Persons with epilepsy, and especially their caregivers, often worry that the PWEs may die of epilepsy or seizures. This worry escalated with knowledge of SUDEP and increased epilepsy severity. Approximately half of PWEs and caregivers believed that knowledge about SUDEP would influence their epilepsy management. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results may help epilepsy care providers determine when to facilitate a discussion about epilepsy-related mortality and SUDEP among patients and caregivers, and to educate those at high risk about the importance of seizure control as well as reduce fears about death in patients with well-controlled and nonconvulsive epilepsies.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR; also known as mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway has been demonstrated in human cortical dysplasia (CD) as well as in animal models of epilepsy. Although inhibition of mTOR signaling early in epileptogenesis suppressed epileptiform activity in the neuron subset-specific Pten knockout (NS-Pten KO) mouse model of CD, the effects of mTOR inhibition after epilepsy is fully established were not previously examined in this model. Here, we investigated whether mTOR inhibition suppresses epileptiform activity and other neuropathological correlates in adult NS-Pten KO mice with severe and well-established epilepsy. METHODS: The progression of epileptiform activity, mTOR pathway dysregulation, and associated neuropathology with age in NS-Pten KO mice were evaluated using video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. A cohort of NS-Pten KO mice was treated with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (10 mg/kg i.p., 5 days/week) starting at postnatal week 9 and video-EEG monitored for epileptiform activity. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the effects of rapamycin on the associated pathology. RESULTS: Epileptiform activity worsened with age in NS-Pten KO mice, with parallel increases in the extent of hippocampal mTOR complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively) dysregulation and progressive astrogliosis and microgliosis. Rapamycin treatment suppressed epileptiform activity, improved baseline EEG activity, and increased survival in severely epileptic NS-Pten KO mice. At the molecular level, rapamycin treatment was associated with a reduction in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling and decreased astrogliosis and microgliosis. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal a wide temporal window for successful therapeutic intervention with rapamycin in the NS-Pten KO mouse model, and they support mTOR inhibition as a candidate therapy for established, late-stage epilepsy associated with CD and genetic dysregulation of the mTOR pathway.",

Herein, we provide a detailed description of the epileptic syndrome in the original family. METHODS: A total of 34 members from a large French-Canadian family were evaluated. Family members with seizures or epilepsy underwent (when possible) clinical, neuropsychological, electrophysiologic, and neuroimaging assessments. RESULTS: Epilepsy was diagnosed in 10 family members (4 deceased, 6 living). In addition to occasional spontaneous complex partial seizures, seven family members clearly had reflex seizures triggered by bathing or showering. Hippocampal atrophy was found in two of five epileptic family members family members who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of three triggered seizures in two affected members showed rhythmic theta activity over temporal head regions. Ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed temporoinsular perfusion changes. Detailed neuropsychological assessments revealed that SYN1 Q555X male mutation carriers showed specific language impairment and mild autistic spectrum disorder. Female carriers also exhibited reading impairments and febrile seizures but no chronic epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: Available evidence suggests that impaired SYN1 function is associated with hyperexcitability of the temporoinsular network and disturbance of high mental functions such as language and social interaction. The presence of reflex bathing seizures, a most peculiar clinical feature, could be helpful in identifying other patients with this syndrome.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Hippocampal sclerosis is a common finding in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies associate the reduction of hippocampal volume with the neuron loss seen on histologic evaluation. Astrogliosis and increased levels of chondroitin sulfate, a major component of brain extracellular matrix, are also seen in hippocampal sclerosis. Our aim was to evaluate the association between hippocampal volume and chondroitin sulfate, as well as neuronal and astroglial populations in the hippocampus of patients with TLE. METHODS: Patients with drug-resistant TLE were subdivided, according to hippocampal volume measured by MRI, into two groups: hippocampal atrophy (HA) or normal volume (NV) cases. Hippocampi from TLE patients and age-matched controls were submitted to immunohistochemistry to evaluate neuronal population, astroglial population, and chondroitin sulfate expression with antibodies against neuron nuclei protein (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and chondroitin sulfate (CS-56) antigens, respectively. RESULTS: Both TLE groups were clinically similar. NV cases had higher hippocampal volume, both ipsilateral and contralateral, when compared to HA. Compared to controls, NV and HA patients had reduced neuron density, and increased GFAP and CS-56 immunopositive area. There was no statistical difference between NV and HA groups in neuron density or immunopositive areas for GFAP and CS-56. Hippocampal volume correlated positively with neuron density in CA1 and prosubiculum, and with immunopositive areas for CS-56 in CA1, and negatively with immunopositive area for GFAP in CA1. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that both neuron density and CS-56 immunopositive area in CA1 were statistically significant predictors of hippocampal volume. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that neuron density and chondroitin sulfate immunopositive area in the CA1 subfield are crucial for the hippocampal volume, and that chondroitin sulfate is important for the maintenance of a normal hippocampal volume in some cases with severe neuron loss.",

METHODS: Patient records from the EMU at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) from 2012 to 2014 were assessed for the presence of multifocal seizures as well the presence of multifocal interictal discharges and multifocal structural imaging abnormalities during the course of the EMU admission. Risk factors for multifocal seizures were assessed using sensitivity and specificity analysis. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the risk of multifocal epilepsy for a given number of consecutive seizures. To overcome the limits of the Kaplan-Meier analysis, a parametric survival function was fit to the EMU subjects with multifocal seizures and this was used to develop a Bayesian model to estimate the risk of multifocal seizures during an EMU admission. RESULTS: Multifocal interictal discharges were a significant predictor of multifocal seizures within an EMU admission with a p < 0.01, albeit with only modest sensitivity 0.74 and specificity 0.69. Multifocal potentially epileptogenic lesions on MRI were not a significant predictor p = 0.44. Kaplan-Meier analysis was limited by wide confidence intervals secondary to significant patient dropout and concern for informative censoring. The Bayesian framework provided estimates for the number of unifocal seizures needed to predict absence of multifocal seizures. To achieve 90\% confidence for the absence of multifocal seizure, three seizures are needed when the pretest probability for multifocal epilepsy is 20\%, seven seizures for a pretest probability of 50\%, and nine seizures for a pretest probability of 80\%.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), pathologic high frequency oscillations (pHFOs, 200-600 Hz) are present in the hippocampus, especially the dentate gyrus (DG). The pHFOs emerge during a latent period prior to the onset of spontaneous generalized seizures. We used a unilateral suprahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA) mouse model of TLE to characterize the properties of hippocampal pHFOs during epileptogenesis. METHODS: In awake head-fixed mice, 4-14 days after KA-induced status epilepticus (SE), we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) with 64-channel silicon probes spanning from CA1 alveus to the DG hilus, or with glass pipettes in the DC mode in the CA1 str radiatum. RESULTS: The pHFOs, are observed simultaneously in the CA1 and the DG, or in the DG alone, as early as 4 days post-SE. The pHFOs ride on top of DC deflections, occur during motionless periods, persist through the onset of TLE, and are generated in bursts. Burst parameters remain remarkably constant during epileptogenesis, with a random number of pHFOs generated per burst. In contrast, pHFO duration and spectral dynamics evolve from short events at 4 days post-SE to prolonged discharges with complex spectral characteristics by 14 days post-SE. Simultaneous dural EEG recordings were exceedingly unreliable for detecting hippocampal pHFOs; therefore, such recordings may deceptively indicate a ``silent'' period even when massive hippocampal activity is present. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that hippocampal pHFOs exhibit a dynamic evolution during the epileptogenic period following SE, consistent with their role in transitioning to the chronic stage of TLE.",

abstract = "The risk of dying suddenly and unexpectedly is increased 24- to 28-fold among young people with epilepsy compared to the general population, but the incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) varies markedly depending on the epilepsy population. This article first reviews risk factors and biomarkers for SUDEP with the overall aim of enabling identification of epilepsy populations with different risk levels as a background for a discussion of possible intervention strategies. The by far most important clinical risk factor is frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), but nocturnal seizures, early age at onset, and long duration of epilepsy have been identified as additional risk factors. Lack of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment or, in the context of clinical trials, adjunctive placebo versus active treatment is associated with increased risks. Despite considerable research, reliable electrophysiologic (electrocardiography [ECG] or electroencephalography [EEG]) biomarkers of SUDEP risk remain to be established. This is an important limitation for prevention strategies and intervention studies. There is a lack of biomarkers for SUDEP, and until validated biomarkers are found, the endpoint of interventions to prevent SUDEP must be SUDEP itself. These interventions, be they pharmacologic, seizure-detection devices, or nocturnal supervision, require large numbers. Possible methods for assessing prevention measures include public health community interventions, self-management, and more traditional (and much more expensive) randomized clinical trials.",

abstract = "The mechanisms of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) have been difficult to define, as most cases occur unwitnessed, and physiologic recordings have been obtained in only a handful of cases. However, recent data obtained from human cases and experimental studies in animal models have brought us closer to identifying potential mechanisms. Theories of SUDEP should be able to explain how a seizure starting in the forebrain can sometimes lead to changes in brainstem cardiorespiratory control mechanisms. Herein we focus on three major themes of work on the causes of SUDEP. First, evidence is reviewed identifying postictal hypoventilation as a major contributor to the cause of death. Second, data are discussed that brainstem serotonin and adenosine pathways may be involved, as well as how they may contribute. Finally, parallels are drawn between SIDS and SUDEP, and we highlight similarities pointing to the possibility of shared pathophysiology involving combined failure of respiratory and cardiovascular control mechanisms. Knowledge about the causes of SUDEP may lead to potential pharmacologic approaches for prevention. We end by describing how translation of this work may result in future applications to clinical care.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Epilepsy Guidelines Task Force, composed of 14 international members, was established in 2011 to identify, using systematic review methodology, international epilepsy clinical care guidelines, assess their quality, and determine gaps in areas of need of development. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature (1985-2014) was performed in six electronic databases (e.g. Medline, Embase) using a broad search strategy without initial limits to language or study design. Six gray literature databases (e.g., American Academy of Neurology [AAN], ILAE) were also searched to minimize publication bias. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts, reviewed full text articles, and performed data abstraction. Descriptive statistics and a meta-analysis were generated. RESULTS: The search identified 10,926 abstracts. Of the 410 articles selected for full text review, 63 met our eligibility criteria for a guideline. Of those included, 54 were in English and 9 were in other languages (French, Spanish, and Italian). Of all guidelines, 29\% did not specify the target age groups, 27\% were focused on adults, 22\% included only children, and 6\% specifically addressed issues related to women with epilepsy. Guidelines included in the review were most often aimed at guiding clinical practice for status epilepticus (n = 7), first seizure (n = 6), drug-resistant epilepsy (n = 5), and febrile seizures (n = 4), among others. Most of the guidelines were therapeutic (n = 35) or diagnostic (n = 16) in nature. The quality of the guidelines using a 1-7 point scale (7 = highest) varied and was moderate overall (mean = 4.99 $\pm$ 1.05 [SD]). SIGNIFICANCE: We identified substantial gaps in topics (e.g., epilepsy in the elderly) and there was considerable heterogeneity in methodologic quality. The findings should offer a valuable resource for health professionals caring for people with epilepsy, since they will help guide the prioritization, development, and dissemination of future epilepsy-related guidelines.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Environmental exposures impart powerful effects on vulnerability to many brain diseases, including epilepsy. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a common form of epilepsy, and it is often accompanied by neuropsychiatric comorbidities. This study tests the hypothesis that environmental enrichment (EE) confers antiepileptogenic, psychoprotective, and neuroprotective effects in the amygdala kindling model of MTLE, and explores potential neurobiologic mechanisms. METHODS: At weaning, male Wistar rats were allocated into either EE (large cages containing running wheels and toys; n = 43) or standard housing (SH; standard laboratory cages; n = 39) conditions. At P56, a bipolar electrode was implanted into the left amygdala, and rats underwent rapid amygdala kindling until experiencing five class V seizures (Racine scale, fully kindled). The elevated plus maze was used to assess anxiety. Postmortem histologic and molecular analyses investigated potential biologic mediators of effects. RESULTS: EE significantly delayed kindling epileptogenesis, with EE rats requiring a significantly greater number of kindling stimulations to reach a fully kindled state compared to SH rats (p < 0.05). EE and kindling both reduced anxiety (p < 0.05). Timm's staining revealed significant reductions in aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in EE rats (p < 0.05), and these effects of EE were accompanied by reduced expression of TrkB and CRH genes. SIGNIFICANCE: We identify beneficial effects of EE on vulnerability to limbic epileptogenesis and anxiety, and identify reduced pathologic neuroplasticity and plasticity-related gene expression as potential underlying mechanisms. Enhanced environmental stimulation represents a potential antiepileptogenic strategy that might also mitigate the common psychiatric comorbidities of MTLE.",

The penetrance in our family was low (three affected out of six mutation carriers), compared to families with either ion channel- or DEPDC5-associated familial nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. The absence of apparent structural brain abnormalities suggests that mutations in NPRL3 are not necessarily associated with focal cortical dysplasia but might be able to cause epilepsy by different, yet unknown pathomechanisms.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To compare heart rate variability (HRV) parameters in newly diagnosed and untreated temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) between the interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal states. METHODS: HRV parameters were extracted from single-lead electrocardiography data collected during video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 14 patients with newly diagnosed TLE in a resting, awake, and supine state. HRV parameters in the time and frequency domains included low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), standard deviation of all consecutive R wave intervals (SDNN), and square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent R wave intervals (RMSSD). Cardiovagal index (CVI), cardiosympathetic index (CSI), and approximate entropy (ApEn) were also studied. RESULTS: Frequency domain analysis showed significantly higher preictal, ictal, and postictal LF/HF ratio compared to the interictal state. Similarly, the LF component increased progressively and was significantly higher during the ictal state compared to interictal and preictal states. RR interval values were lower in the ictal state compared to basal and preictal states and in the postictal state compared to the preictal state. Interictal RMSSD was significantly higher compared to all other states, and ictal SDNN was significantly higher compared to all other states. Ictal CSI was significantly higher compared to preictal and interictal states, whereas preictal CVI was lower than in basal and ictal states. In addition, ictal ApEn was significantly lower than interictal and preictal ApEn. Interictal CVI was lower in left TLE compared to right TLE. In addition, in left TLE, ictal CVI was higher than interictal CVI, whereas in right TLE, CVI was lower in the preictal state compared to all other states. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest an ictal sympathetic overdrive with partial recovery in the postictal state. Higher sympathetic tone and vagal tone imbalance may induce early autonomic dysfunction and increase cardiovascular risk in patients affected by TLE.",

author = "Kuo, Jonathan and Zhao, Wenjie and Li, Chin-Shang and Kennedy, Jeffrey D and Seyal, Masud",
abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiology of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remains undetermined. Seizures are accompanied by respiratory dysfunction (RD). Postictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES) may follow generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Following GTCS patients have impaired arousal and may be motionless. Patients with SUDEP are usually prone. Postictal immobility (PI) may contribute to SUDEP by not permitting repositioning of the head to allow unimpeded ventilation. To determine whether RD and/or ictal characteristics are associated with PI, we analyzed patients with GTCS in the epilepsy monitoring unit. METHOD: We investigated for associations between PI duration and PGES, ictal/postictal oxygen saturation (SpO2 ), end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2 ), seizure localization, duration, and tonic and total convulsive phase duration. We investigated for linkage between PGES and these measures. RESULTS: Seventy patients with 181 GTCS and available SpO2 and/or ETCO2 data were studied. Simple linear regression analysis by seizures showed that PI duration was associated with peak periictal ETCO2 (p = 0.03), duration of oxygen desaturation (p = 0.005) and with SpO2 nadir (p = 0.02). PI duration was not associated with tonic, convulsive phase or total seizure duration. Analysis by patients also showed significant association of PI with RD. Duration of PI was longer following seizures with PGES (p < 0.001). PGES was not associated with the tonic, convulsive phase or total seizure duration. SpO2 nadir was lower in seizures with PGES (p = 0.046), ETCO2 peak change (p = 0.003) was higher, and duration of ETCO2 elevation (p = 0.03) was longer. Multivariable regression analysis showed that PGES and severe RD were associated with PI duration. SIGNIFICANCE: The duration of PI and presence of PGES are associated with periictal RD. The duration of PI is also associated with the presence of PGES. Seizure duration or duration of the convulsive phase is not associated with PI or PGES. Interventions aimed at reversing impaired arousal and PI may reduce SUDEP risk.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Examine therapeutic potential of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NERI) in an animal model of comorbidity between epilepsy, depression-like, and impulsive-like impairments. METHODS: Epilepsy was induced in male Wistar rats by LiCl and pilocarpine. An SSRI fluoxetine (FLX), and an NERI reboxetine (RBX) were administered either alone or as a combination over 1 week. Depressive-like and impulsive-like behaviors were examined using the forced swim test. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry was used to analyze serotonergic transmission in the raphe nucleus (RN)-prefrontal cortex (PFC) pathway, and noradrenergic transmission in locus coeruleus (LC)-PFC, and LC-RN projections. Monoamine levels in PFC were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Functional capacities of 5-HT1A receptors and $\alpha$2A adrenoreceptors in PFC were analyzed by autoradiography. RESULTS: Epileptic rats showed behavioral signs of depression and hyperimpulsivity, suppressed serotonergic and noradrenergic tones, decreased levels of serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine (NE); 5-HT1A receptor and $\alpha$2A adrenoreceptors functions remained intact. FLX failed to improve behavioral deficits, but effectively raised 5-HT level and marginally improved RN-PFC serotonergic transmission. RBX reversed impulsive-like behavior, normalized content of NE and noradrenergic tone in LC-PFC and LC-RN. FLX-RBX combination fully reversed depressive-like behavior, and normalized RN-PFC serotonergic transmission. None of the treatment modified the function of 5-HT and NE receptors. SIGNIFICANCE: Depressive- and impulsive-like behaviors in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy stem respectively from dysfunctions of serotonergic and noradrenergic ascending pathways. At the same time, epilepsy-associated depression is SSRI resistant. The finding that an SSRI-NERI combination exerts antidepressant effect, along with RBX-induced improvement of LC-RN noradrenergic transmission point toward the involvement of LC-RN noradrenergic input in enabling therapeutic potential of FLX. Medications that improve serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission, such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors may be effective in treating epilepsy-associated SSRI-resistant depression, as well as concurrent depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

abstract = "The aim was to systematically review studies that have focused on symptoms of anxiety reported by parents of children (0-18 years) with epilepsy. PubMed was used to identify relevant studies. Selected studies were reviewed with respect to prevalence of above threshold scores and comparisons with controls on standardized measures of anxiety. Studies are also reported with respect to factors associated with parental anxiety, impact on child outcomes, and comparisons with studies that have included equivalent measures of symptoms of depression. Fifteen studies that met inclusion criteria were identified. None of the studies were population based. The percentage of parents scoring above cutoffs on standardized measures of anxiety was 9-58\%. In comparison with parents of healthy controls, parents of children with epilepsy had higher mean scores in two of three studies where this was measured. Possible correlates of parental anxiety in childhood epilepsy that were considered varied widely across studies. Factors such as seizure frequency and use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been associated with parental anxiety in some but not all studies. With respect to child outcome, increased parental anxiety has been associated with lower quality of life and lower scores on adaptive behavior domains. Symptoms of anxiety are common among parents of children with epilepsy. There is a need for more systematic, representative studies to identify the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and track the course of symptoms. Such studies will help to identify more clearly factors associated with parental anxiety and impact of symptoms on child and parent outcomes. Intervention studies are needed to evaluate approaches that target a reduction in symptoms and the potential impact on parental and child functioning. Furthermore, there is a need to evaluate the impact of antiepileptic therapies and interventions that focus on child neurobehavioral comorbidities on parental anxiety.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The discovery of mutations in DEPDC5 in familial focal epilepsies has introduced a novel pathomechanism to a field so far dominated by ion channelopathies. DEPDC5 is part of a complex named GAP activity toward RAGs (GATOR) complex 1 (GATOR1), together with the proteins NPRL2 and NPRL3, and acts to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. GATOR1 is in turn inhibited by the GATOR2 complex. The mTORC1 pathway is a major signaling cascade regulating cell growth, proliferation, and migration. We aimed to study the contribution of GATOR complex genes to the etiology of focal epilepsies and to describe the associated phenotypical spectrum. METHODS: We performed targeted sequencing of the genes encoding the components of the GATOR1 (DEPDC5, NPRL2, and NPRL3) and GATOR2 (MIOS, SEC13, SEH1L, WDR24, and WDR59) complex in 93 European probands with focal epilepsy with or without focal cortical dysplasia. Phospho-S6 immunoreactivity was used as evidence of mTORC1 pathway activation in resected brain tissue of patients carrying pathogenic variants. RESULTS: We identified four pathogenic variants in DEPDC5, two in NPRL2, and one in NPRL3. We showed hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway in brain tissue from patients with NPRL2 and NPRL3 mutations. Collectively, inactivating mutations in GATOR1 complex genes explained 11\% of cases of focal epilepsy, whereas no pathogenic mutations were found in GATOR2 complex genes. GATOR1-related focal epilepsies differ clinically from focal epilepsies due to mutations in ion channel genes by their association with focal cortical dysplasia and seizures emerging from variable foci, and might confer an increased risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). SIGNIFICANCE: GATOR1 complex gene mutations leading to mTORC1 pathway upregulation is an important cause of focal epilepsy with cortical malformations and represents a potential target for novel therapeutic approaches.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenomenology of monitored sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) occurring in the interictal period where death occurs without a seizure preceding it. METHODS: We report a case series of monitored definite and probable SUDEP where no electroclinical evidence of underlying seizures was found preceding death. RESULTS: Three patients (two definite and one probable) had SUDEP. They had a typical high SUDEP risk profile with longstanding intractable epilepsy and frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). All patients had varying patterns of respiratory and bradyarrhythmic cardiac dysfunction with profound electroencephalography (EEG) suppression. In two patients, patterns of cardiorespiratory failure were similar to those seen in some patients in the Mortality in Epilepsy Monitoring Units Study (MORTEMUS). SIGNIFICANCE: SUDEP almost always occur postictally, after GTCS and less commonly after a partial seizure. Monitored SUDEP or near-SUDEP cases without a seizure have not yet been reported in literature. When nonmonitored SUDEP occurs in an ambulatory setting without an overt seizure, the absence of EEG information prevents the exclusion of a subtle seizure. These cases confirm the existence of nonseizure SUDEP; such deaths may not be prevented by seizure detection-based devices. SUDEP risk in patients with epilepsy may constitute a spectrum of susceptibility wherein some are relatively immune, death occurs in others with frequent GTCS with one episode of seizure ultimately proving fatal, while in others still, death may occur even in the absence of a seizure. We emphasize the heterogeneity of SUDEP phenomena.",

author = "Zhang, Honghai and Zhao, Haiting and Yang, Xiaoxuan and Xue, Qingsheng and Cotten, Joseph F and Feng, Hua-Jun",
abstract = "Summary Objective The DBA/1 mouse is a relevant animal model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), as it exhibits seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) evoked by acoustic stimulation, followed by cardiac arrhythmia and death. Defects in serotonergic neurotransmission may contribute to S-IRA. The tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) enzyme converts L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a precursor for central nervous system (CNS) serotonin (5-HT) synthesis; and DBA/1 mice have a polymorphism that decreases TPH2 activity. We, therefore, hypothesized that supplementation with 5-HTP may bypass TPH2 and suppress S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. Methods TPH2 expression was examined by Western blot in the brainstem of DBA/1 and C57BL/6J mice both with and without acoustic stimulation. Changes in breathing and cardiac electrical activity in DBA/1 and C57BL/6J mice that incurred sudden death during generalized seizures evoked by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) were studied by plethysmography and electrocardiography. The effect of 5-HTP administration on seizure-induced mortality evoked by acoustic stimulation or by PTZ was investigated in DBA/1 mice. Results Repetitive acoustic stimulation resulted in reduced TPH2 protein in the brainstem of DBA/1 mice as compared with C57BL/6J mice. S-IRA evoked by acoustic stimulation in DBA/1 mice was significantly reduced by 5-HTP. Following S-IRA, cardiac electrical activity could be detected for minutes before terminal asystole and death in both DBA/1 and C57BL/6J mice after PTZ treatment. The incidence of S-IRA by PTZ administration was greater in DBA/1 than in C57BL/6J mice, and administration of 5-HTP also significantly reduced S-IRA by PTZ in DBA/1 mice. Significance Our data suggest that S-IRA is the primary event leading to death incurred in most DBA/1 and some C57BL/6J mice during PTZ-evoked seizures. Suppression of S-IRA by 5-HTP suggests that 5-HT transmission contributes to the pathophysiology of S-IRA, and that 5-HTP, an over-the-counter supplement available for human consumption, may be clinically useful in preventing SUDEP.",

title = "Seizure-related modulation of systemic arterial blood pressure in focal epilepsy",
author = "Hampel, Kevin G and Jahanbekam, Amirhossein and Elger, Christian E and Surges, Rainer",
abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Cardiorespiratory function alterations are commonly observed with epileptic seizures and may lead to syncope and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although most previous research has focused on controlling heart rate (HR) and respiration, little is known about seizure-related regulation of systemic blood pressure (BP). Herein, we have investigated whether the periictal modulation of systemic BP and HR depends on seizure characteristics. METHODS: Systemic arterial BP, HR, and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2 ) were continuously and noninvasively monitored using the ccNexfin device in those epilepsy patients undergoing video-electroencephalography (EEG) telemetry. Data are given as mean $\pm$ standard deviation (SD). RESULTS: Forty-five seizures in 37 patients were included. In focal seizures (FS, n = 35), the mean arterial BP (MAP) increased by 33 $\pm$ 35\% and the HR by 53 $\pm$ 44\%, whereas the SPO2 remained unaltered. The MAP and HR increases were significantly greater in FS with alterations in consciousness than in those without. For those FS that evolved to bilateral convulsive seizures (BCS, n = 10), all of the ictal recordings were compromised by artifacts. However, 2 min after seizure cessation, the MAP was enhanced by only 16 $\pm$ 14\% and returned to a baseline slightly below preictal levels after 5 min, whereas the HR was increased by 77 $\pm$ 33\% and remained elevated throughout the postictal phase. SIGNIFICANCE: Periictal regulation of systemic BP and HR displays distinct patterns depending on the type of seizure with focal onset. These changes were unrelated to alterations in SPO2 . The potential clinical implications of these findings are discussed in the article.",

author = "Kienzler-Norwood, Friederike and Costard, Lara and Sadangi, Chinmaya and M{\"u}ller, Philipp and Neubert, Valentin and Bauer, Sebastian and Rosenow, Felix and Norwood, Braxton A",
abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Kainic acid (KA) is a potent glutamate analog that is used to induce neurodegeneration and model temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in rodents. KA reliably induces severe, prolonged seizures, that is, convulsive status epilepticus (cSE), which is typically fatal without pharmacologic intervention. Although the use of KA to model human epilepsy has proven unquestionably valuable for >30 years, significant variability and mortality continue to confound results. These issues are probably the consequence of cSE, an all-or-nothing response that is inherently capricious and uncontrollable. The relevance of cSE to the human condition is dubious, however, as most patients with epilepsy never experienced it. We sought to develop a simple, KA-based animal model of TLE that avoids cSE and its confounds. METHODS: Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats received coincident subcutaneous injections of KA (5 mg) and lorazepam (0.25 mg), approximately 15.0 and 0.75 mg/kg, respectively. Continuous video-electroencephalography (EEG) was used to monitor acute seizure activity and detect spontaneous seizures. Immunocytochemistry, Fluoro-Jade B staining, and Timm staining were used to characterize both acute and chronic neuropathology. RESULTS: Acutely, focal hippocampal seizures were induced, which began after about 30 min and were self-terminating after a few hours. Widespread hippocampal neurodegeneration was detected after 4 days. Spontaneous, focal hippocampal seizures began after an average of 12 days in all animals. Classic hippocampal sclerosis and mossy fiber sprouting characterized the long-term neuropathology. Morbidity and mortality rates were both 0\%. SIGNIFICANCE: We show here that the effects of systemic KA can be limited to the hippocampus simply with coadministration of a benzodiazepine at a low dose. This means that lorazepam can block convulsive seizures without truly stopping seizure activity. This novel, cSE-free animal model reliably mimics the defining characteristics of acquired mesial TLE: hippocampal sclerosis and spontaneous hippocampal-onset seizures after a prolonged seizure-free period, without significant morbidity, mortality, or nonresponders.",

Because current knowledge is insufficient to form a scientifically based classification, the 2017 Classification is operational (practical) and based on the 1981 Classification, extended in 2010. Changes include the following: (1) ``partial'' becomes ``focal''; (2) awareness is used as a classifier of focal seizures; (3) the terms dyscognitive, simple partial, complex partial, psychic, and secondarily generalized are eliminated; (4) new focal seizure types include automatisms, behavior arrest, hyperkinetic, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional; (5) atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, and tonic seizures can be of either focal or generalized onset; (6) focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure replaces secondarily generalized seizure; (7) new generalized seizure types are absence with eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic absence, myoclonic-atonic, myoclonic-tonic-clonic; and (8) seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified. The new classification does not represent a fundamental change, but allows greater flexibility and transparency in naming seizure types.",

As a critical tool for the practicing clinician, epilepsy classification must be relevant and dynamic to changes in thinking, yet robust and translatable to all areas of the globe. Its primary purpose is for diagnosis of patients, but it is also critical for epilepsy research, development of antiepileptic therapies, and communication around the world. The new classification originates from a draft document submitted for public comments in 2013, which was revised to incorporate extensive feedback from the international epilepsy community over several rounds of consultation. It presents three levels, starting with seizure type, where it assumes that the patient is having epileptic seizures as defined by the new 2017 ILAE Seizure Classification. After diagnosis of the seizure type, the next step is diagnosis of epilepsy type, including focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, combined generalized, and focal epilepsy, and also an unknown epilepsy group. The third level is that of epilepsy syndrome, where a specific syndromic diagnosis can be made. The new classification incorporates etiology along each stage, emphasizing the need to consider etiology at each step of diagnosis, as it often carries significant treatment implications. Etiology is broken into six subgroups, selected because of their potential therapeutic consequences. New terminology is introduced such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The term benign is replaced by the terms self-limited and pharmacoresponsive, to be used where appropriate. It is hoped that this new framework will assist in improving epilepsy care and research in the 21st century.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The literature is sparse on the complex interrelationships between stressors, depression, anxiety disorders, and epilepsy. We hypothesized that a relationship exists between stress and epilepsy. We evaluated whether markers of stress are associated with seizure recurrence in a low income community-based cohort of adults with single unprovoked seizure or newly diagnosed epilepsy. METHODS: We ascertained adult residents of Northern Manhattan and Harlem, New York City, with a first unprovoked seizure or newly diagnosed epilepsy, between December 2010 and January 2013. At enrollment, we collected information about seizure phenomenology, demographics, clinical information, and measures of stress (environmental stress, stressful life events, facets of allostatic load-i.e., the cumulative effect of adaptation to stress, psychiatric disorders, and low collective efficacy). Collective efficacy assesses neighborhood characteristics and incorporates social cohesion and informal social control. All subjects were followed for 2 years for further seizures. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios of seizure recurrence during the 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 52 subjects (64.2\%) with a single unprovoked seizure and 29 (35.9\%) with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Seizure recurrence was recorded in 38.5\% (N = 20) of subjects with a single unprovoked seizure and in 69\% of those with epilepsy (N = 20) (p = 0.01). In the overall sample, the hazard of seizure recurrence was increased by lifetime generalized anxiety disorder (3.0-fold) and by low collective efficacy (2.7-fold). In a second model, the hazard was increased by lifetime mood disorder (2.1-fold) and low collective efficacy (2.5-fold). SIGNIFICANCE: Markers of stress (i.e., low collective efficacy, lifetime mood disorder, and lifetime generalized anxiety disorder) were associated with an increased risk for seizure recurrence in adults with a single unprovoked seizure or newly diagnosed epilepsy. Stress-reducing interventions, such as mindfulness, may be a useful, safe, and inexpensive adjunctive treatment for epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Currently, approximately 60-70\% of patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remain seizure-free 3 years after surgery. The goal of this work was to develop a presurgical connectivity-based biomarker to identify those patients who will have an unfavorable seizure outcome 1-year postsurgery. METHODS: Resting-state functional and diffusion-weighted 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired from 22 unilateral (15 right, 7 left) patients with TLE and 35 healthy controls. A seizure propagation network was identified including ipsilateral (to seizure focus) and contralateral hippocampus, thalamus, and insula, with bilateral midcingulate and precuneus. Between each pair of regions, functional connectivity based on correlations of low frequency functional MRI signals, and structural connectivity based on streamline density of diffusion MRI data were computed and transformed to metrics related to healthy controls of the same age. RESULTS: A consistent connectivity pattern representing the network expected in patients with seizure-free outcome was identified using eight patients who were seizure-free at 1-year postsurgery. The hypothesis that increased similarity to the model would be associated with better seizure outcome was tested in 14 other patients (Engel class IA, seizure-free: n = 5; Engel class IB-II, favorable: n = 4; Engel class III-IV, unfavorable: n = 5) using two similarity metrics: Pearson correlation and Euclidean distance. The seizure-free connectivity model successfully separated all the patients with unfavorable outcome from the seizure-free and favorable outcome patients (p = 0.0005, two-tailed Fisher's exact test) through the combination of the two similarity metrics with 100\% accuracy. No other clinical and demographic predictors were successful in this regard. SIGNIFICANCE: This work introduces a methodologic framework to assess individual patients, and demonstrates the ability to use network connectivity as a potential clinical tool for epilepsy surgery outcome prediction after more comprehensive validation.",

abstract = "Dravet syndrome, an early onset epileptic encephalopathy, is most often caused by de novo mutation of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN1A. Mouse models with deletion of Scn1a recapitulate Dravet syndrome phenotypes, including spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures, susceptibility to seizures induced by elevated body temperature, and elevated risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Importantly, the epilepsy phenotype of Dravet mouse models is highly strain-dependent, suggesting a strong influence of genetic modifiers. We previously identified Cacna1g, encoding the Cav3.1 subunit of the T-type calcium channel family, as an epilepsy modifier in the Scn2aQ54 transgenic epilepsy mouse model. In this study, we asked whether transgenic alteration of Cacna1g expression modifies severity of the Scn1a+/- Dravet phenotype. Scn1a+/- mice with decreased Cacna1g expression showed partial amelioration of disease phenotypes with improved survival and reduced spontaneous seizure frequency. However, reduced Cacna1g expression did not alter susceptibility to hyperthermia-induced seizures. Transgenic elevation of Cacna1g expression had no effect on the Scn1a+/- epilepsy phenotype. These results provide support for Cacna1g as a genetic modifier in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome and suggest that Cav3.1 may be a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention in patients.",

abstract = "A recent article by Farrell et al. characterizes the phenomenon, mechanisms, and treatment of a local and severe hypoperfusion/hypoxia event that occurs in brain regions following a focal seizure. Given the well-established role of cerebral ischemia/hypoxia in brain damage and behavioral dysfunction in other clinical settings (e.g., stroke, cerebral vasospasm), we put forward a new theory: postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia is responsible for the negative consequences associated with seizures. Fortunately, inhibition of two separate molecular targets, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and l-type calcium channels, can prevent the expression of postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia. These inhibitors are important experimental tools used to separate the seizure from the resulting hypoperfusion/hypoxia and can allow researchers to address the contribution of this phenomenon to negative outcomes associated with seizures. Herein we address the implications of this postictal stroke-like event in acute behavioral dysfunction (e.g., Todd's paresis) and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Moreover, anatomic alterations such as increased blood-brain barrier permeability, glial activation, central inflammation, and neuronal loss could also be a consequence of repeated hypoperfusion/hypoxic events and, in turn, underlie chronic interictal cognitive and behavioral comorbidities (e.g., memory deficits, anxiety, depression, and psychosis) and exacerbate epileptogenesis. Thus these seemingly disparate and clinically important observations may share a common point of origin: postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: New devices are needed for monitoring seizures, especially those associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). They must be unobtrusive and automated, and provide false alarm rates (FARs) bearable in everyday life. This study quantifies the performance of new multimodal wrist-worn convulsive seizure detectors. METHODS: Hand-annotated video-electroencephalographic seizure events were collected from 69 patients at six clinical sites. Three different wristbands were used to record electrodermal activity (EDA) and accelerometer (ACM) signals, obtaining 5,928 h of data, including 55 convulsive epileptic seizures (six focal tonic-clonic seizures and 49 focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures) from 22 patients. Recordings were analyzed offline to train and test two new machine learning classifiers and a published classifier based on EDA and ACM. Moreover, wristband data were analyzed to estimate seizure-motion duration and autonomic responses. RESULTS: The two novel classifiers consistently outperformed the previous detector. The most efficient (Classifier III) yielded sensitivity of 94.55\%, and an FAR of 0.2 events/day. No nocturnal seizures were missed. Most patients had <1 false alarm every 4 days, with an FAR below their seizure frequency. When increasing the sensitivity to 100\% (no missed seizures), the FAR is up to 13 times lower than with the previous detector. Furthermore, all detections occurred before the seizure ended, providing reasonable latency (median = 29.3 s, range = 14.8-151 s). Automatically estimated seizure durations were correlated with true durations, enabling reliable annotations. Finally, EDA measurements confirmed the presence of postictal autonomic dysfunction, exhibiting a significant rise in 73\% of the convulsive seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed multimodal wrist-worn convulsive seizure detectors provide seizure counts that are more accurate than previous automated detectors and typical patient self-reports, while maintaining a tolerable FAR for ambulatory monitoring. Furthermore, the multimodal system provides an objective description of motor behavior and autonomic dysfunction, aimed at enriching seizure characterization, with potential utility for SUDEP warning.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The most common reported seizure-precipitant is stress. We recently showed a biologic basis for stress sensitivity of seizures: cortisol levels in people with stress-sensitive epilepsy correlated with focal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on electroencephalography (EEG). Here we aimed to determine whether the effect of cortisol on the epileptic brain is global or focal, and whether cortisol affects all brains or just those of stress-sensitive people. Because epilepsy is associated with changes in functional brain connectivity, we studied the relationship between cortisol and changes in global and focal (node-centered) functional connectivity measures for individuals with stress-sensitive and non-stress-sensitive epilepsy. METHODS: Seventeen people with epilepsy underwent long-term (>24 h) EEG recording. During the first 5 h after waking, saliva was collected every 15 min for cortisol measurements. Theta-band functional connectivity was assessed for every 15 min of the recording. We calculated the average phase-lag index (PLI) between all channels as a measure of global functional connectivity. We used network Strength, the averaged PLI per channel, as focal functional connectivity measure. We correlated cortisol, global, and focal functional connectivity (Strength) with IED frequency using linear mixed models. Analyses were split for people with and without stress-sensitivity of seizures. RESULTS: Cortisol was negatively correlated with global functional connectivity in people with stress-sensitive seizures (estimate -0.0020; P < .01), whereas not in those without stress-sensitivity (estimate -0.0003; P = .46). This relationship occurred irrespective of the presence of IEDs on a channel (channels without IEDs and stress-sensitivity: estimate -0.0019; P < .01, non-stress-sensitive -0.0003; P = .41). Global and focal functional connectivity were negatively correlated with IED frequency, irrespective of stress sensitivity of seizures or channel type. SIGNIFICANCE: People with stress-sensitive epilepsy have a whole-brain neuronal response to cortisol that is different from that of people with non-stress-sensitive epilepsy. This offers a basis for understanding seizure genesis in stress-sensitive epilepsy, which might require a different treatment approach.",

abstract = "The most common forms of acquired epilepsies arise following acute brain insults such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, or central nervous system infections. Treatment is effective for only 60\%-70\% of patients and remains symptomatic despite decades of effort to develop epilepsy prevention therapies. Recent preclinical efforts are focused on likely primary drivers of epileptogenesis, namely inflammation, neuron loss, plasticity, and circuit reorganization. This review suggests a path to identify neuronal and molecular targets for clinical testing of specific hypotheses about epileptogenesis and its prevention or modification. Acquired human epilepsies with different etiologies share some features with animal models. We identify these commonalities and discuss their relevance to the development of successful epilepsy prevention or disease modification strategies. Risk factors for developing epilepsy that appear common to multiple acute injury etiologies include intracranial bleeding, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, more severe injury, and early seizures within 1 week of injury. In diverse human epilepsies and animal models, seizures appear to propagate within a limbic or thalamocortical/corticocortical network. Common histopathologic features of epilepsy of diverse and mostly focal origin are microglial activation and astrogliosis, heterotopic neurons in the white matter, loss of neurons, and the presence of inflammatory cellular infiltrates. Astrocytes exhibit smaller K+ conductances and lose gap junction coupling in many animal models as well as in sclerotic hippocampi from temporal lobe epilepsy patients. There is increasing evidence that epilepsy can be prevented or aborted in preclinical animal models of acquired epilepsy by interfering with processes that appear common to multiple acute injury etiologies, for example, in post-status epilepticus models of focal epilepsy by transient treatment with a trkB/PLC$\gamma$1 inhibitor, isoflurane, or HMGB1 antibodies and by topical administration of adenosine, in the cortical fluid percussion injury model by focal cooling, and in the albumin posttraumatic epilepsy model by losartan. Preclinical studies further highlight the roles of mTOR1 pathways, JAK-STAT3, IL-1R/TLR4 signaling, and other inflammatory pathways in the genesis or modulation of epilepsy after brain injury. The wealth of commonalities, diversity of molecular targets identified preclinically, and likely multidimensional nature of epileptogenesis argue for a combinatorial strategy in prevention therapy. Going forward, the identification of impending epilepsy biomarkers to allow better patient selection, together with better alignment with multisite preclinical trials in animal models, should guide the clinical testing of new hypotheses for epileptogenesis and its prevention.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Increased breathing rate, apnea, and respiratory failure are associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We recently demonstrated the progressive nature of epilepsy and mortality in Kcna1-/- mice, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy and SUDEP. Here we tested the hypothesis that respiratory dysfunction progresses with age in Kcna1-/- mice, thereby increasing risk of respiratory failure and sudden death (SD). METHODS: Respiratory parameters were determined in conscious mice at baseline and following increasing doses of methacholine (MCh) using noninvasive airway mechanics (NAM) systems. Kcna1+/+ , Kcna1+/- , and Kcna1-/- littermates were assessed during 3 age ranges when up to ~30\%, ~55\%, and ~90\% of Kcna1-/- mice have succumbed to SUDEP: postnatal day (P) 32-36, P40-46, and P48-56, respectively. Saturated arterial O2 (SaO2 ) was determined with pulse oximetry. Lung and brain tissues were isolated and Kcna1 gene and protein expression were evaluated by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot techniques. Airway smooth muscle responsiveness was assessed in isolated trachea exposed to MCh. RESULTS: Kcna1-/- mice experienced an increase in basal respiratory drive, chronic oxygen desaturation, frequent apnea-hypopnea (A-H), an atypical breathing sequence of A-H-tachypnea-A-H, increased tidal volume, and hyperventilation induced by MCh. The MCh-provoked hyperventilation was dramatically attenuated with age. Of interest, only Kcna1-/- mice developed seizures following exposure to MCh. Seizures were provoked by lower concentrations of MCh as Kcna1-/- mice approached SD. MCh-induced seizures experienced by a subset of younger Kcna1-/- mice triggered death. Respiratory parameters of these younger Kcna1-/- mice resembled older near-SD Kcna1-/- mice. Kcna1 gene and protein were not expressed in Kcna1+/+ and Kcna1+/- lungs, and MCh-mediated airway smooth muscle contractions exhibited similar half-maximal effective concentration( EC50 ) in isolated Kcna1+/+ and Kcna1-/- trachea. SIGNIFICANCE: The Kcna1-/- model of SUDEP exhibits progressive respiratory dysfunction, which suggests a potential increased susceptibility for respiratory failure during severe seizures that may result in sudden death.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Antiseizure drugs are the leading therapeutic choice for treatment of epilepsy, but their efficacy is limited by pharmacoresistance and the occurrence of unwanted side effects. Here, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of KCNQ channel activation by retigabine in preventing seizures and neurocardiac dysfunction in 2 potassium channelopathy mouse models of epilepsy with differing severity that have been associated with increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP): the Kcna1-/- model of severe epilepsy and the Kcnq1A340E/A340E model of mild epilepsy. METHODS: A combination of behavioral, seizure threshold, electrophysiologic, and gene expression analyses was used to determine the effects of KCNQ activation in mice. RESULTS: Behaviorally, Kcna1-/- mice exhibited unexpected hyperexcitability instead of the expected sedative-like response. In flurothyl-induced seizure tests, KCNQ activation decreased seizure latency by $\geq$50\% in Kcnq1 strain mice but had no effect in the Kcna1 strain, suggesting the influence of genetic background. However, in simultaneous electroencephalography and electrocardiography recordings, KCNQ activation significantly reduced spontaneous seizure frequency in Kcna1-/- mice by ~60\%. In Kcnq1A340E/A340E mice, KCNQ activation produced adverse cardiac effects including profound bradycardia and abnormal increases in heart rate variability and atrioventricular conduction blocks. Analyses of Kcnq2 and Kcnq3 mRNA levels revealed significantly elevated Kcnq2 expression in Kcna1-/- brains, suggesting that drug target alterations may contribute to the altered drug responses. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that treatment strategies in channelopathy may have unexpected outcomes and that effective rebalancing of channel defects requires improved understanding of channel interactions at the circuit and tissue levels. The efficacy of KCNQ channel activation and manifestation of adverse effects were greatly affected by genetic background, potentially limiting KCNQ modulation as a way to prevent neurocardiac dysfunction in epilepsy and thereby SUDEP risk. Our data also uncover a potential role for KCNQ2-5 channels in autonomic control of chronotropy.",

author = "Tanaka, Hideaki and Khoo, Hui Ming and Dubeau, Fran{\c c}ois and Gotman, Jean",
abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the correlation between scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracerebral EEG (iEEG) seizure-onset patterns in patients with focal lesional epilepsy to determine whether scalp seizure-onset patterns can be specific to intracerebral seizure-onset patterns and to lesion type. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 61 patients with focal epilepsy and a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible lesion, who first underwent extensive scalp recordings and then iEEG studies (stereo-EEG) for presurgical evaluation, and who showed an iEEG seizure onset in the lesional/perilesional area. Five seizure-onset patterns were recognized on scalp EEG, and 7 on iEEG, and in each patient, only the predominant scalp and iEEG seizure-onset patterns were compared. Because scalp and iEEG recordings were acquired at different times, we followed strict criteria based on semiology and topography to match scalp with intracerebral seizures. RESULTS: Seventy-one pairs of seizure-onset patterns matched between scalp and iEEG were identified. Each scalp pattern did not correspond to a single intracerebral pattern, but there were significant associations: (1) paroxysmal fast activity ($\geq$13 Hz) at scalp onset was associated with low-voltage fast activity at iEEG onset (P < .001), with malformations of cortical development (P < .001), and with superficial seizure-onset zone based on iEEG (P < .001); (2) rhythmic slow activity (<13 Hz) at scalp onset was associated with low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spikes at iEEG onset (P = .0014), with medial temporal atrophy/sclerosis (P < .001), and with deep seizure-onset zone (P < .001); and (3) repetitive epileptiform discharge at scalp onset was associated with a burst of high-amplitude polyspikes at iEEG onset (P = .0002). SIGNIFICANCE: Our results disclosed that in focal epilepsy patients with seizures generated in an MRI-visible lesion, some scalp seizure-onset patterns are highly associated with a specific intracerebral pattern, with specific pathologies, and with the depth of seizure-onset zone. These findings allow the interpretation of scalp seizure-onset patterns to be significantly more informative.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Given the significant impact epilepsy can have on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with this condition and their families, there is great clinical interest in evidence-based psychological treatments aimed at enhancing well-being in people with epilepsy (PWE). An evaluation of the current evidence is needed to assess the effects of psychological treatments for PWE on HRQoL outcomes to inform future therapeutic recommendations and research designs. METHODS: The operational definition of psychological treatments included a broad range of interventions that use psychological or behavioral techniques designed to improve HRQoL, psychiatric comorbidities, and seizure frequency and severity for adults and children with epilepsy. A systematic literature search was conducted in line with Cochrane criteria for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating psychological treatments and using HRQoL outcome measures as primary or secondary outcome measures. Standard methodological procedures required by the Cochrane Collaboration were used for data collection and analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-four completed RCTs were included in this review (2439 participants). Based on satisfactory methodological homogeneity, data from 9 studies (468 participants) providing Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31) outcomes were pooled for meta-analyses, showing significant mean changes for QOLIE-31 total score and 6 subscales. The significant mean changes of QOLIE-31 total score (mean improvement of 5.68 points; 95\% confidence interval = 3.11-8.24, P < .0001) and 3 subscales (emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, overall quality of life [QoL]) exceeded the threshold of minimally important change, indicating a clinically meaningful postintervention improvement of QoL. Overall, the meta-analysis quality of evidence was characterized as ``moderate'' due to the risk of bias present in 8 of the 9 included studies (Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Version 5.1.0, 2011, Chapters 8 and 12). A narrative synthesis was conducted for all trials and outcomes that were not entered in the meta-analysis. SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide moderate-quality evidence that psychological treatments for adults with epilepsy may enhance HRQoL in people with epilepsy.",

METHODS: All deaths in patients treated in clinical trials (N = 256) or following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (N = 451) through May 5, 2016, were adjudicated for SUDEP. RESULTS: There were 14 deaths among 707 patients (2208 postimplantation years), including 2 possible, 1 probable, and 4 definite SUDEP events. The rate of probable or definite SUDEP was 2.0/1000 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-5.2) over 2036 patient stimulation years and 2.3/1000 (95\% CI 0.9-5.4) over 2208 patient implant years. Stored electrocorticograms around the time of death were available for 4 patients with probable/definite SUDEP and revealed the following: frequent epileptiform activity ending abruptly (n = 2), no epileptiform activity or seizures (n = 1), and an electrographic and witnessed seizure with cessation of postictal electrocorticography (ECoG) activity associated with apnea and pulselessness (n = 1). SIGNIFICANCE: The SUDEP rate of 2.0/1000 patient stimulation years among patients treated with the RNS System is favorable relative to treatment-resistant epilepsy patients randomized to the placebo arm of add-on drug studies or with seizures after resective surgery.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Limited data are available regarding the evolution over time of the rate of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP) in drug-resistant epilepsy. The objective is to analyze a database of 40 443 patients with epilepsy implanted with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy in the United States (from 1988 to 2012) and assess whether SUDEP rates decrease during the postimplantation follow-up period. METHODS: Patient vital status was ascertained using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Death Index (NDI). An expert panel adjudicated classification of cause of deaths as SUDEP based on NDI data and available narrative descriptions of deaths. We tested the hypothesis that SUDEP rates decrease with time using the Mann-Kendall nonparametric trend test and by comparing SUDEP rates of the first 2 years of follow-up (years 1-2) to longer follow-up (years 3-10). RESULTS: Our cohort included 277 661 person-years of follow-up and 3689 deaths, including 632 SUDEP. Primary analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in age-adjusted SUDEP rate during follow-up (S = -27 P = .008), with rates of 2.47/1000 for years 1-2 and 1.68/1000 for years 3-10 (rate ratio 0.68; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.87; P = .002). Sensitivity analyses confirm these findings. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that SUDEP risk significantly decreases during long-term follow-up of patients with refractory epilepsy receiving VNS Therapy. This finding might reflect several factors, including the natural long-term dynamic of SUDEP rate, attrition, and the impact of VNS Therapy. The role of each of these factors cannot be confirmed due to the limitations of the study.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate periictal central apnea as a seizure semiological feature, its localizing value, and possible relationship with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) pathomechanisms. METHODS: We prospectively studied polygraphic physiological responses, including inductance plethysmography, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2 ), electrocardiography, and video electroencephalography (VEEG) in 473 patients in a multicenter study of SUDEP. Seizures were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 seizure classification based on the most prominent clinical signs during VEEG. The putative epileptogenic zone was defined based on clinical history, seizure semiology, neuroimaging, and EEG. RESULTS: Complete datasets were available in 126 patients in 312 seizures. Ictal central apnea (ICA) occurred exclusively in focal epilepsy (51/109 patients [47\%] and 103/312 seizures [36.5\%]) (P < .001). ICA was the only clinical manifestation in 16/103 (16.5\%) seizures, and preceded EEG seizure onset by 8 $\pm$ 4.9 s, in 56/103 (54.3\%) seizures. ICA $\geq$60 s was associated with severe hypoxemia (SpO2 <75\%). Focal onset impaired awareness (FOIA) motor onset with automatisms and FOA nonmotor onset semiologies were associated with ICA presence (P < .001), ICA duration (P = .002), and moderate/severe hypoxemia (P = .04). Temporal lobe epilepsy was highly associated with ICA in comparison to extratemporal epilepsy (P = .001) and frontal lobe epilepsy (P = .001). Isolated postictal central apnea was not seen; in 3/103 seizures (3\%), ICA persisted into the postictal period. SIGNIFICANCE: ICA is a frequent, self-limiting semiological feature of focal epilepsy, often starting before surface EEG onset, and may be the only clinical manifestation of focal seizures. However, prolonged ICA ($\geq$60 s) is associated with severe hypoxemia and may be a potential SUDEP biomarker. ICA is more frequently seen in temporal than extratemporal seizures, and in typical temporal seizure semiologies. ICA rarely persists after seizure end. ICA agnosia is typical, and thus it may remain unrecognized without polygraphic measurements that include breathing parameters.",

Anatomic findings (eg, tongue/lip bite) are commonly absent and of varying specificity, thereby limiting the evidence to implicate epilepsy as a cause of or contributor to death. Thus it is likely that death certificates significantly underrepresent the true number of deaths in which epilepsy was a factor. To address this, members of the National Association of Medical Examiners, North American SUDEP Registry, Epilepsy Foundation SUDEP Institute, American Epilepsy Society, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention constituted an expert panel to generate evidence-based recommendations for the practice of death investigation and autopsy, toxicological analysis, interpretation of autopsy and toxicology findings, and death certification to improve the precision of death certificate data available for public health surveillance of epilepsy-related deaths. The recommendations provided in this paper are intended to assist medical examiners, coroners, and death investigators when a sudden unexpected death in a person with epilepsy is encountered.",

Autopsy showed a combination of developmental and acquired lesions: (1) bilateral gyral malformations of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and insular cortex; (2) agenesis of the olfactory tracts and bulbs; (3) hippocampal abnormalities: dentate gyrus bilamination and granule cell dispersion; and (4) areas of microscopic bilateral, symmetric white matter spongiosis in the brainstem central tegmental tract, amiculum and hilum of the inferior olive, medial longitudinal fasciculus, paragigantocellularis lateralis, optic nerves and chiasm, and hypothalamus. The white matter spongiosis was identical to the histopathologic lesions (which by EM exhibited intramyelinic edema) that were demonstrated in animal models on vigabatrin therapy, indicating that vigabatrin toxicity is not restricted to animal models.",

METHODS: Prospective case-series based on persons with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code for epilepsy in the Swedish Patient Registry 1998-2005, who were alive on June 30, 2006 (n = 60 952). Linkage to the National Cause-of-Death Registry identified all deaths from July 2006 through December 2011, with epilepsy mentioned on death certificate, together with all deaths during 2008 (n = 3166). Death certificates, medical charts, autopsy, and police reports were reviewed to identify SUDEP cases and related circumstances. Autopsied non-SUDEP deaths (n = 60) from the study population served as a reference. RESULTS: There were 329 SUDEPs (63\% men) of which 167 were definite, 89 probable, and 73 possible. SUDEP cases were younger at death (50.8 years) than non-SUDEP deaths (73.3 years) (P < .001) and more likely to be male (63\% vs 55\%, P = .0079). Most SUDEP cases died at night (58\%), at home (91\%), and 65\% were found dead in bed. When documented, 70\% were found in prone position. In 17\%, death was witnessed and in 88\% of these, a seizure was observed. Of the 329 SUDEP cases, 71\% were living alone and 14\% shared a bedroom.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a tragic and devastating event for which the underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood; this study investigated whether abnormalities in heart rate variability (HRV) are linked to SUDEP in patients with epilepsy due to mutations in sodium channel (SCN) genes. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated HRV in epilepsy patients using electroencephalographic studies to study the potential contribution of autonomic dysregulation to SUDEP risk. We extracted HRV data, in wakefulness and sleep, from 80 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, including 40 patients with mutations in SCN genes and 40 control patients with non-SCN drug-resistant epilepsy. From the SCN group, 10 patients had died of SUDEP. We compared HRV between SUDEP and non-SUDEP groups, specifically studying awake HRV and sleep:awake HRV ratios. RESULTS: The SUDEP patients had the most severe autonomic dysregulation, showing lower awake HRV and either extremely high or extremely low ratios of sleep-to-awake HRV in a subgroup analysis. A secondary analysis comparing the SCN and non-SCN groups indicated that autonomic dysfunction was slightly worse in the SCN epilepsy group. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that autonomic dysfunction is associated with SUDEP risk in patients with epilepsy due to sodium channel mutations. The relationship of HRV to SUDEP merits further study; HRV may eventually have potential as a biomarker of SUDEP risk, which would allow for more informed counseling of patients and families, and also serve as a useful outcome measure for research aimed at developing therapies and interventions to reduce SUDEP risk.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive surgical technique for focal epilepsy. A major appeal of LITT is that it may result in fewer cognitive deficits, especially when targeting dominant hemisphere mesial temporal lobe (MTL) epilepsy. To evaluate this, as well as to determine seizure outcomes following LITT, we evaluated the relationships between ablation volumes and surgical or cognitive outcomes in 43 consecutive patients undergoing LITT for MTL epilepsy. METHODS: All patients underwent unilateral LITT targeting mesial temporal structures. FreeSurfer software was used to derive cortical and subcortical segmentation of the brain (especially subregions of the MTL) using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ablation volumes were outlined using a postablation T1-contrasted MRI. The percentages of the amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex ablated were quantified objectively. The volumetric measures were regressed against changes in neuropsychological performance before and after surgery, RESULTS: A median of 73.7\% of amygdala, 70.9\% of hippocampus, and 28.3\% of entorhinal cortex was ablated. Engel class I surgical outcome was obtained in 79.5\% and 67.4\% of the 43 patients at 6 and 20.3 months of follow-up, respectively. No significant differences in surgical outcomes were found across patient subgroups (hemispheric dominance, hippocampal sclerosis, or need for intracranial evaluation). Furthermore, no significant differences in volumes ablated were found between patients with Engel class IA vs Engel class II-IV outcomes. In patients undergoing LITT in the dominant hemisphere, a decline in verbal and narrative memory, but not in naming function was noted. SIGNIFICANCE: Seizure-free outcomes following LITT may be comparable in carefully selected patients with and without MTS, and these outcomes are comparable with outcomes following microsurgical resection. Failures may result from non-mesial components of the epileptogenic network that are not affected by LITT. Cognitive declines following MTL-LITT are modest, and principally affect memory processes.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Both drowning and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) are diagnoses of exclusion with predominantly nonspecific autopsy findings. We hypothesized that people with epilepsy found dead in water with no clear sign of submersion could be misdiagnosed as SUDEP. METHODS: All reported seizure-related deaths undergoing medicolegal investigation in three medical examiner's offices (New York City, Maryland, San Diego County) over different time periods were reviewed to identify epilepsy-related drownings and SUDEPs. Drowning cases that fulfilled inclusion criteria were divided into two groups according to the circumstances of death: definite drowning and possible drowning. The SUDEP group included two sex- and age ($\pm$2 years)-matched definite SUDEP/definite SUDEP plus cases for each drowning case. RESULTS: Of 1346 deaths reviewed, we identified 36 definite (76.6\%) and 11 possible drowning deaths (23.4\%), most of which occurred in a bathtub (72.3\%). There were drowning-related findings, including fluid within the sphenoid sinuses, foam in the airways, clear fluid in the stomach content, and lung hyperinflation in 58.3\% (21/36) of the definite drowning group, 45.5\% (5/11) of the possible drowning group, and 4.3\% of the SUDEP group (4/92). There was no difference in the presence of pulmonary edema/congestion between the definite drowning group, possible drowning group, and SUDEP group. The definite drowning group had a higher mean combined lung weight than the SUDEP group, but there was no difference in mean lung weights between the possible drowning and SUDEP groups or between the possible drowning and definite drowning groups. SIGNIFICANCE: No distinguishable autopsy finding could be found between SUDEPs and epilepsy-related drownings when there were no drowning-related signs and no clear evidence of submersion. SUDEP could be the cause of death in such possible drowning cases. As most drowning cases occurred in the bathtub, supervision and specific bathing precautions could be effective prevention strategies.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the frequency of probable obstructive sleep apnea (pOSA) in refractory epilepsy monitoring unit inpatients and clinical features associated with pOSA, including risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). METHODS: We prospectively recruited 49 consecutive adult patients admitted to the Mayo Clinic Epilepsy Monitoring Unit with focal, generalized, or unclassified epilepsy syndromes. pOSA was identified using oximetric oxyhemoglobin desaturation index (ODI) and the Sleep Apnea-Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SA-SDQ) and STOP-BAG screening tools. Revised SUDEP Risk Inventory (rSUDEP-7) scores were calculated, and epilepsy patients with and without pOSA were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Correlation and regression analyses were utilized to determine relationships between pOSA and rSUDEP-7 scores. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of patients had pOSA, with a mean ODI of 11.3 $\pm$ 5.1/h (range = 5.1-22.8). Patients with pOSA were older and heavier, and more frequently had a focal epilepsy syndrome and longer epilepsy duration, with higher SA-SDQ and STOP-BAG scores (all P < 0.05). Median rSUDEP-7 score was 3 $\pm$ 1.4 (range = 0-6). Higher rSUDEP-7 scores were positively correlated with higher ODI (P = 0.036). rSUDEP-7 score $\geq$ 5 was associated with pOSA by ODI, SA-SDQ, and STOP-BAG questionnaire criteria (P < 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Our pilot study identified a high frequency of pOSA in refractory epilepsy monitoring patients, finding that pOSA patients were older and heavier, with higher screening symptoms for sleep apnea and more frequent focal seizures with a longer epilepsy duration. We also found a possible association between OSA and SUDEP risk. Identification and treatment of OSA in patients with epilepsy could conceivably provide a novel approach toward preventing the risk of SUDEP. Future studies with polysomnography are needed to confirm predictive features for OSA in epilepsy populations, and to determine whether OSA is associated with SUDEP risk.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a significant public health burden. Epidemiological studies have identified clinical SUDEP risk factors across large populations, but the means to apply this information to individual patients are lacking. The SUDEP-7 Inventory was developed as a marker of clinical SUDEP risk and has been used in studies of potential SUDEP biomarkers. We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from 16 patients dying of SUDEP and 48 matched living epilepsy controls to determine whether individuals succumbing to SUDEP could be distinguished from living epilepsy controls using the revised SUDEP-7 Inventory, the absolute number of clinical risk factors as identified by an International League Against Epilepsy meta-analysis (ILAE score), and physiological characteristics previously associated with SUDEP risk. Mean revised SUDEP-7 Inventory score was 3.3 $\pm$ 2.0 in SUDEP cases and 3.8 $\pm$ 2.3 in controls (P = 0.39). Mean ILAE score was 2.4 $\pm$ 1.1 in SUDEP cases and 2.6 $\pm$ 1.4 in controls (P = 0.62). There were no significant differences in interictal heart rate variability (measured by the root mean square of differences of successive RR intervals), periictal cardiorespiratory dysfunction, and postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression between the groups.

abstract = "Summary Objectives We aimed to describe intracerebral aspects of postictal generalized electroencephalography suppression (PGES) following focal to bilateral tonic?clonic (?secondarily generalized tonic?clonic?) seizures (GTCS) recorded using stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG), and to correlate these with electroclinical features. Methods Three independent observers scored semiologic and SEEG features. Patient and epilepsy characteristics were collected. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were performed. The operational definition of PGES on SEEG used strict criteria (absence of visible signal at 20 ?V/mm amplitude, in all readable channels). Postictal regional suppression (RS) was identified if only a subset of implanted electrodes showed absence of signal. Results We evaluated 100 seizures in 52 patients. Interobserver agreement was good (? 0.72 for clinical features and 0.73 for EEG features). PGES was present in 27 of 100 and RS without PGES present in 42 of 100 seizures. Region of RS included epileptogenic zone in 43 of 51 (86\%). No effect of sampling (multilobar or bilateral exploration) was seen. Oral tonicity (mouth opening and/or tonic vocalization during the tonic phase of GTCS) was associated with the presence of PGES (P = 0.029; negative predictive value [NPV] 0.91). Bilateral upper limb extension during the tonic phase correlated with PGES (P = 0.041; NPV 0.85). Association of both oral tonicity and bilateral upper limb extension had a high NPV of 0.96. Significance SEEG recordings confirm true absence of signal during postictal EEG suppression. PGES is unlikely when both upper limb extension and oral tonicity are absent. We hypothesize that bilateral tonic seizure discharge at bulbar level brainstem regions is associated with the production of oral signs and may relate to mechanisms of PGES.",

Here, we investigated alterations in the probabilistic hippocampal-thalamic pathway (pHTP) underlying sGTCS using diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a cohort of TLE patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). METHODS: We consecutively recruited 51 unilateral TLE-HS patients (26 with and 25 without sGTCS) and 22 healthy controls. Probabilistic tractography was used to track the pHTP. Raw fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of the pHTP were corrected by the FA/MD of the hemispheric white matter on the same side. The volume of the thalamic subregion connected to the hippocampus (TSCH) was investigated. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations of the hippocampus, the TSCH, and the thalamic subregion unconnected to the hippocampus in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were also calculated. RESULTS: After correction, the sGTCS group showed lower FA than the non-sGTCS group (P = 0.03), and lower FA as well as higher MD than controls in the ipsilateral pHTP. The non-sGTCS group only showed higher corrected MD in the ipsilateral pHTP relative to controls. Corrected FA or MD in the contralateral pHTP did not differ among groups. The TSCH was located in the mesial aspect of the thalamus, and it was atrophied in the sGTCS group compared to the non-sGTCS group and controls. The sGTCS group had lower fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the ipsilateral hippocampus and TSCH compared to controls. SIGNIFICANCE: In TLE-HS, sGTCS was associated with impaired integrity of the pHTP as well as structural and functional abnormalities in the medial thalamus. The medial thalamus is important in seizure generalization in mTLE.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The dynamics of the postictal period, which may demonstrate such dramatic clinical phenomena as focal neurological deficits, prolonged coma and immobility, and even sudden death, are poorly understood. We sought to classify and characterize postictal phases of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures based on electroencephalographic (EEG) criteria and associated clinical features. METHODS: We performed a detailed electroclinical evaluation of the postictal period in a series of 31 bilateral tonic-clonic seizures in 16 patients undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluations for focal pharmacoresistant epilepsy with intracranial electrodes and time-locked video. RESULTS: The postictal EEG demonstrated three clearly differentiated phases as follows: attenuation, a burst-attenuation pattern, and a return to continuous background, with abrupt, synchronized transitions between phases. Postictal attenuation was common, occurring in 84\% of seizures in 94\% of patients in this study. There was increased power in gamma frequencies (>25 Hz) during postictal attenuation periods relative to preictal baseline in 88\% of seizures demonstrating the attenuation pattern (n = 25 seizures, P 90\% of channels in 13 seizures (52\%) and <10\% of channels in three seizures (12\%). Postictal immobility was seen in 87\% of seizures, with either a flaccid (58\%) or rigid/dystonic (29\%) appearance. Clinical motor manifestations, including focal dystonic posturing, automatisms, head and eye deviation, and myoclonic jerking, continued or emerged within the first minute following seizure termination in 48\% of seizures, regardless of EEG appearance. SIGNIFICANCE: Intracranial postictal attenuation, which may be diffuse or focal, is so common that it should be regarded as a ubiquitous feature of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, rather than an unusual event. The prominence of high-frequency activity coupled with emerging clinical features, including rigid immobility and semiologies such as automatisms, during the postictal period supports the presence of ongoing seizure-related neuronal activity in unrecorded brain regions.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: No biomarkers reliably predict risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Postictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES) is a possible biomarker for SUDEP risk. However, its utility in predicting SUDEP remains uncertain. We had observed that postictal tonic electromyography (PTEMG) activity follows some generalized convulsive seizures (GCS). PTEMG activity and PGES may have a common pathophysiologic basis. PGES is associated with periictal respiratory distress. There is evidence that tonic EMG occurs with brain hypoxia. Thus PTEMG activity may be related to seizure-associated hypoxemia. Pronounced variation occurs among expert clinicians in identifying PGES, thereby limiting its utility as a biomarker. Characteristics of PTEMG activity and its relationship to preceding GCS have not been explored. We studied PTEMG activity characteristics, its relationship to the preceding seizure and associated respiratory dysfunction. METHODS: We reviewed 145 GCS in 66 patients undergoing video-EEG telemetry (VET). The presence of PTEMG activity was defined when tonic EMG occurred for at least 3 seconds following seizure termination and was identified with filter settings at 5-200 Hz. Duration of PTEMG activity, the seizure, PGES, seizure-associated peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) change, and end-tidal CO2 were analyzed. We compared data from GCS with and without PTEMG activity. RESULTS: Ninety of 145 seizures with GCS had PTEMG activity. The remainder had postictal slowing without PTEMG activity, and cessation of activity was followed by EEG slowing. Duration of the initial PTEMG discharge was 39.1 (mean) $\pm$ (standard deviation) 17.9 seconds. SpO2 nadir was lower (P = 0.005) in seizures with PTEMG activity than in those without (72\% vs 77\%). End-tidal CO2 was higher (P = 0.05) in seizures with PTEMG activity than in those without (63 vs 56 mm Hg). PGES duration was 35.6 $\pm$ 22.2 seconds and associated with duration of PTEMG activity (P < 0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: The novel finding is that PTEMG activity occurs following 62\% of GCS and that seizures with PTEMG activity have greater severity of respiratory dysfunction than seizures without. PTEMG activity is readily discerned by visual analysis of VET at appropriate filter settings and has the potential of being a complementary or surrogate biomarker of PGES for assessing SUDEP risk.",

author = "Kruse, Stephen W and Dayton, Kyle G and Purnell, Benton S and Rosner, Jared I and Buchanan, Gordon F",
abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. Although the mechanisms for SUDEP are incompletely understood, seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) has been strongly and consistently implicated. A body of evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT), a modulator of breathing, plays a critical role in SUDEP. Because the 5-HT and norepinephrine (NE) systems interact in many biologic processes and NE is known to modulate breathing and seizures, we hypothesized that NE may play a role in S-IRA and SUDEP. METHODS: We examined the effects of pharmacologic manipulation of 5-HT and NE on S-IRA and death following maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures in adult wild-type (WT) mice, genetically 5-HT neuron-deficient (Lmx1bf/f/p ) mice, and chemically NE neuron-deficient mice. Mice were treated with pharmacologic agents targeting the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems and subjected to seizure induction via MES while breathing was measured via whole-body plethysmography. RESULTS: S-IRA and death was reduced in WT mice with NE reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), reboxetine and atomoxetine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fluoxetine and citalopram, and the dual 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), duloxetine. S-IRA and death was also reduced in Lmx1bf/f/p mice with reboxetine and fluoxetine. The protective effects of the reuptake inhibitors were prevented by the $\alpha$1 antagonist, prazosin. Citalopram did not reduce S-IRA and death in NE neuron-deficient mice. SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that 5-HT and NE critically interact in the modulation of breathing following a seizure and potentially inform preventive strategies for SUDEP.",

author = "Tupal, Srinivasan and Faingold, Carl L",
abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Prevention of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a critical goal for epilepsy therapy. The DBA/1 mouse model of SUDEP exhibits an elevated susceptibility to seizure-induced death in response to electroconvulsive shock, hyperthermia, convulsant drug, and acoustic stimulation. The serotonin hypothesis of SUDEP is based on findings that treatments which modify serotonergic function significantly alter susceptibility to seizure-induced sudden death in several epilepsy models, including DBA/1 mice. Serotonergic abnormalities have also recently been observed in human SUDEP. Fenfluramine is a drug that enhances serotonin release in the brain. Recent studies have found that the addition of fenfluramine improved seizure control in patients with Dravet syndrome, which has a high incidence of SUDEP. Therefore, we investigated the effects of fenfluramine on seizures and seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) in DBA/1 mice. METHODS: The dose and time course of the effects of fenfluramine (i.p.) on audiogenic seizures (Sz) induced by an electric bell in DBA/1 mice were determined. Videos of Sz-induced behaviors were recorded for analysis. Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was evaluated using the chi-square test. RESULTS: Sixteen hours after administration of 15 mg/kg of fenfluramine, a high incidence of selective block of S-IRA susceptibility (P < 0.001) occurred in DBA/1 mice without blocking any convulsive behavior. Thirty minutes after 20-40 mg/kg of fenfluramine, significant reductions of seizure incidence and severity, as well as S-IRA susceptibility occurred, which were long-lasting ($\geq$48 hours). The median effective dose (ED50 ) of fenfluramine for significantly reducing Sz at 30 minutes was 21 mg/kg. SIGNIFICANCE: This study presents the first evidence for the effectiveness of fenfluramine in reducing seizure incidence, severity, and S-IRA susceptibility in a mammalian SUDEP model. The ability of fenfluramine to block S-IRA selectively suggests the potential usefulness of fenfluramine in prophylaxis of SUDEP. These results further confirm and extend the serotonin hypothesis of SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Severe periictal respiratory depression is thought to be linked to risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) but its determinants are largely unknown. Interindividual differences in the interictal ventilatory response to CO2 (hypercapnic ventilatory response [HCVR] or central respiratory CO2 chemosensitivity) may identify patients who are at increased risk for severe periictal hypoventilation. HCVR has not been studied previously in patients with epilepsy; therefore we evaluated a method to measure it at bedside in an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) and examined its relationship to postictal hypercapnia following generalized convulsive seizures (GCSs). METHODS: Interictal HCVR was measured by a respiratory gas analyzer using a modified rebreathing technique. Minute ventilation (VE ), tidal volume, respiratory rate, end tidal (ET) CO2 and O2 were recorded continuously. Dyspnea during the test was assessed using a validated scale. The HCVR slope ($\Delta$VE /$\Delta$ETCO2 ) for each subject was determined by linear regression. During the video-electroencephalography (EEG) study, subjects underwent continuous respiratory monitoring, including measurement of chest and abdominal movement, oronasal airflow, transcutaneous (tc) CO2 , and capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2 ). RESULTS: Sixty-eight subjects completed HCVR testing in 151 $\pm$ (standard deviation) 58 seconds, without any serious adverse events. HCVR slope ranged from -0.94 to 5.39 (median 1.71) L/min/mm Hg. HCVR slope correlated with the degree of unpleasantness and intensity of dyspnea and was inversely related to baseline ETCO2 . Both the duration and magnitude of postictal tcCO2 rise following GCSs were inversely correlated with HCVR slope. SIGNIFICANCE: Measurement of the HCVR is well tolerated and can be performed rapidly and safely at the bedside in the EMU. A subset of individuals has a very low sensitivity to CO2 , and this group is more likely to have a prolonged increase in postictal CO2 after GCS. Low interictal HCVR may increase the risk of severe respiratory depression and SUDEP after GCS and warrants further study.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of functional MRI (fMRI) to predict postoperative language decline compared to direct cortical stimulation (DCS) in epilepsy surgery patients. METHODS: In this prospective case series, 17 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy had intracranial monitoring and resection from 2012 to 2016 with 1-year follow-up. All patients completed preoperative language fMRI, mapping with DCS of subdural electrodes, pre- and postoperative neuropsychological testing for language function, and resection. Changes in language function before and after surgery were assessed. fMRI activation and DCS electrodes in the resection were evaluated as potential predictors of language decline. RESULTS: Four of 17 patients (12 female; median [range] age, 43 [23-59] years) experienced postoperative language decline 1 year after surgery. Two of 4 patients had overlap of fMRI activation, language-positive electrodes in basal temporal regions (within 1 cm), and resection. Two had overlap between resection volume and fMRI activation, but not DCS. fMRI demonstrated 100\% sensitivity and 46\% specificity for outcome compared to DCS (50\% and 85\%, respectively). When fMRI and DCS language findings were concordant, the combined tests showed 100\% sensitivity and 75\% specificity for language outcome. Seizure-onset age, resection side, type, volume, or 1 year seizure outcome did not predict language decline. SIGNIFICANCE: Language localization overlap of fMRI and direct cortical stimulation in the resection influences postoperative language performance. Our preliminary study suggests that fMRI may be more sensitive and less specific than direct cortical stimulation. Together they may predict outcome better than either test alone.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The processes underlying sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remain elusive, but centrally mediated cardiovascular or respiratory collapse is suspected. Volume changes in brain areas mediating recovery from extreme cardiorespiratory challenges may indicate failure mechanisms and allow prospective identification of SUDEP risk. METHODS: We retrospectively imaged SUDEP cases (n = 25), patients comparable for age, sex, epilepsy syndrome, localization, and disease duration who were high-risk (n = 25) or low-risk (n = 23), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 25) with identical high-resolution T1-weighted scans. Regional gray matter volume, determined by voxel-based morphometry, and segmentation-derived structure sizes were compared across groups, controlling for total intracranial volume, age, and sex. RESULTS: Substantial bilateral gray matter loss appeared in SUDEP cases in the medial and lateral cerebellum. This was less prominent in high-risk subjects and absent in low-risk subjects. The periaqueductal gray, left posterior and medial thalamus, left hippocampus, and bilateral posterior cingulate also showed volume loss in SUDEP. High-risk subjects showed left thalamic volume reductions to a lesser extent. Bilateral amygdala, entorhinal, and parahippocampal volumes increased in SUDEP and high-risk patients, with the subcallosal cortex enlarged in SUDEP only. Disease duration correlated negatively with parahippocampal volume. Volumes of the bilateral anterior insula and midbrain in SUDEP cases were larger the closer to SUDEP from magnetic resonance imaging. SIGNIFICANCE: SUDEP victims show significant tissue loss in areas essential for cardiorespiratory recovery and enhanced volumes in areas that trigger hypotension or impede respiratory patterning. Those changes may shed light on SUDEP pathogenesis and prospectively detect patterns identifying those at risk.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a critical issue in epilepsy, and DBA/1 mice are a useful animal model of this devastating epilepsy sequela. The serotonin hypothesis for SUDEP proposes that modifying serotonergic function significantly alters susceptibility to seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA). Agents that enhance serotonergic function, including a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, selectively prevent S-IRA in DBA/1 mice. This study examined fluoxetine-induced changes in brain activity using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to reveal sites in the DBA/1 mouse brain where fluoxetine acts to prevent S-IRA. METHODS: DBA/1 mice were subjected to audiogenic seizures (Sz) after saline or fluoxetine (45 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) administration. Control DBA/1 mice received fluoxetine or saline, but Sz were not evoked. A previous MEMRI study established the regions of interest (ROIs) for Sz in the DBA/1 mouse brain, and the present study examined MEMRI differences in the ROIs of these mouse groups. RESULTS: The neural activity in several ROIs was significantly increased in fluoxetine-treated DBA/1 mice that exhibited Sz but not S-IRA when compared to the saline-treated mice that exhibited both Sz and respiratory arrest. These structures included the periaqueductal gray (PAG), amygdala, reticular formation (sensorimotor-limbic network), K{\"o}lliker-Fuse nucleus, facial-parafacial group (respiratory network), and pontine raphe. Of these ROIs, only the PAG showed significantly decreased neural activity with saline pretreatment when seizure-induced respiratory arrest occurred as compared to saline treatment without seizure. SIGNIFICANCE: The PAG is known to play an important compensatory role for respiratory distress caused by numerous exigent situations in normal animals. The pattern of fluoxetine-induced activity changes in the present study suggests that PAG may be the most critical target for fluoxetine's action to prevent seizure-induced sudden death. These findings have potential clinical importance, because there is evidence of anomalous serotonergic function and PAG imaging abnormalities in human SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: $\gamma$-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptor subunit gene mutations are significant causes of epilepsy, which are often accompanied by various neuropsychiatric comorbidities, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. It has been suggested that the comorbidities are caused by seizures, as the comorbidities often present in severe epilepsy syndromes. However, findings from both humans and animal models argue against this conclusion. Mutations in the GABAA receptor $\gamma$2 subunit gene GABRG2 have been associated with anxiety alone or with severe epilepsy syndromes and comorbid anxiety, suggesting that a core molecular defect gives rise to the phenotypic spectrum. Here, we determined the pathophysiology of comorbid anxiety in GABRG2 loss-of-function epilepsy syndromes, identified the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) as a primary site for epilepsy comorbid anxiety, and demonstrated a potential rescue of comorbid anxiety via neuromodulation of CeA neurons. METHODS: We used brain slice recordings, subcellular fractionation with Western blot, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and a battery of behavior tests in combination with a chemogenetic approach to characterize anxiety and its underlying mechanisms in a Gabrg2+/Q390X knockin mouse and a Gabrg2+/- knockout mouse, each associated with a different epilepsy syndrome. RESULTS: We found that impaired GABAergic neurotransmission in CeA underlies anxiety in epilepsy, which is due to reduced GABAA receptor subunit expression resulting from the mutations. Impaired GABAA receptor expression reduced GABAergic neurotransmission in CeA, but not in basolateral amygdala. Activation or inactivation of inhibitory neurons using a chemogenetic approach in CeA alone modulated anxietylike behaviors. Similarly, pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling via $\gamma$2 subunit-containing receptors relieved the anxiety. SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these data demonstrate the molecular basis for a comorbidity of epilepsy, anxiety, and suggest that impaired GABAA receptor function in CeA due to a loss-of-function mutation could at least contribute to anxiety. Modulation of CeA neurons could cause or suppress anxiety, suggesting a potential use of CeA neurons as therapeutic targets for treatment of anxiety in addition to traditional pharmacological approaches.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Oroalimentary automatisms (OAAs) are common clinical manifestations of medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Nevertheless, the location of the symptomatogenic zone of OAAs remains unclear. The generation mechanism of OAAs also has not been clarified. We attempt to explain these problems by analyzing interictal [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18 FDG-PET) imaging and ictal stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recordings in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy were analyzed retrospectively. All underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) and were seizure-free. The patients were divided into OAA (+) and OAA (-) groups according to the occurrence of consistent stereotyped OAAs. The interictal PET data were compared with those of 18 healthy controls and were then compared between groups using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Functional connectivity using linear regression analysis was performed between the target brain regions. To clarify the network of OAAs, ictal epileptogenicity index (EI) values, and the nonlinear correlation method h2 were performed with SEEG on patients. RESULTS: Compared to OAAs (-), the rolandic operculum was the only area with significant differences. Hippocampus and rolandic operculum showed significant correlations in the OAA (+) group (y = 0.758x+0.470, R2 = 0.456, P = 0.000). No correlation was found in the OAA (-) group (P = 0.486). The EI values of the OAA (+) group (median 0.20) were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than those of the OAA (-) group (median 0). The h2 in the OAA (+) group (h2 = 0.23 $\pm$ 0.13) showed stronger functional connectivity (t = 6.166, P < 0.0001) than that of the OAA (-) group (h2 = 0.08 $\pm$ 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: The rolandic operculum is most likely to be the symptomatogenic zone of OAAs. In medial temporal lobe epilepsy, unilateral functional connection from the hippocampus to the rolandic operculum during seizure onset is the basis for the generation of OAAs.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in elderly individuals with epilepsy. METHODS: We searched four electronic databases as well as bibliographies and conference abstracts. Published and unpublished, randomized, or quasirandomized trials reporting the use of AEDs in people aged at least 60 years with epilepsy were eligible for inclusion. Two authors independently carried out each stage of the review. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models. RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred seventeen titles and abstracts were reviewed. Eighteen studies evaluating 12 AEDs met all eligibility criteria. Ten studies, comprising 1999 subjects, were suitable for meta-analysis. Among the elderly with epilepsy, lamotrigine (LTG) is better tolerated relative to carbamazepine (pooled weighted risk ratio [RR] of experiencing withdrawal due to adverse events = 1.83, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-2.43). There is a higher probability, although with a 95\% CI of borderline importance, of seizure freedom when comparing levetiracetam to LTG (RR = 0.83, 95\% CI = 0.68-0.97). Single studies provide evidence for the efficacy and/or tolerability of other AEDs in the elderly, including brivaracetam, gabapentin, lacosamide, perampanel, and topiramate. The risk of bias of the included studies was frequently low or unclear, although there was on occasion a high risk of bias (especially with regard to selective reporting). SIGNIFICANCE: There is some evidence for AED use in the elderly with epilepsy. More evidence is required, comparing newer AEDs to prior generations as well as examining the effects of determinants such as frailty, to guide clinicians when treating this rapidly growing patient population.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a less-invasive approach to surgery for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with lower health care costs and costs of lost productivity over time, compared to open surgery. METHODS: We compared direct medical costs and indirect productivity costs associated with treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) in the ROSE (Radiosurgery or Open Surgery for Epilepsy) trial. Health care use was abstracted from hospital bills, the study database, and diaries in which participants recorded health care use and time lost from work while seeking care. Costs of use were calculated using a Medicare costing approach used in a prior study of the costs of ATL. The power of many analyses was limited by the sample size and data skewing. RESULTS: Combined treatment and follow-up costs (in thousands of US dollars) did not differ between SRS (n = 20, mean = $76.6, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 50.7-115.6) and ATL (n = 18, mean = $79.0, 95\% CI = 60.09-103.8). Indirect costs also did not differ. More ATL than SRS participants were free of consciousness-impairing seizures in each year of follow-up (all P < 0.05). Costs declined following ATL (P = 0.005). Costs tended to increase over the first 18 months following SRS (P = 0.17) and declined thereafter (P = 0.06). This mostly reflected hospitalizations for SRS-related adverse events in the second year of follow-up. SIGNIFICANCE: Lower initial costs of SRS for medial temporal lobe epilepsy were largely offset by hospitalization costs related to adverse events later in the course of follow-up. Future studies of less-invasive alternatives to ATL will need to assess adverse events and major costs systematically and prospectively to understand the economic implications of adopting these technologies.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To investigate how prolonged seizure activity affects cardiorespiratory function and activity of pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex, leading to sudden death. METHODS: Urethane-anesthetized female Long-Evans rats were implanted with nasal thermocouple; venous and arterial cannulae; and electrodes for electrocardiography (ECG) and hippocampal, cortical, and brainstem recording. Kainic acid injection into the ventral hippocampus induced status epilepticus. RESULTS: Seizures caused hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea punctuated by recurrent transient apneas. Salivation increased considerably: in 11 of 12 rats, liquid with alkaline pH consistent with saliva was expelled from the mouth. Most transient apneas were obstructive: nasal airflow ceased, while, in 83\%, efforts to breathe persisted as continued rhythmic activity of respiratory pre-B{\"o}tzinger neurons, inspiratory electromyography (EMG), and excursions of the chest wall and abdomen. Blood pressure oscillated in time with respiratory efforts. This pattern also occurred in a minority of cases (16\%) of incomplete apnea, but not in rare cases (1\%) of transient central apneas. During transient obstructive apneas, the frequency of all inspiratory efforts decreased abruptly by ~30\%, suggesting a resetting of the central respiratory rhythm generator. Twenty-two of thirty-one rats died, due either to obstructive apnea (12) or central apnea following progressive slowing of respiration (10). Most rats dying of central apnea had experienced several transient obstructive apneas. Negative DC field potential shifts of the brainstem followed the final breath, consistent with previous reports on spreading depolarization in mouse models. Timing suggests that the DC shift is a consequence rather than cause of respiratory collapse. Cardiac activity continued for tens of seconds. SIGNIFICANCE: Seizure activity in forebrain induces pronounced autonomic activation and disrupts activity in medullary respiratory centers, resulting in death from either obstructive or central apnea. These results directly inform mechanisms of death in status epilepticus, and indirectly provide clues to mechanisms of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).",

Although seizures in mTLE originate focally in the hippocampus or amygdala, mTLE patients demonstrate cognitive deficits that extend beyond temporal lobe function-such as decline in executive function, cognitive processing speed, and attention-as well as diffuse decreases in neocortical metabolism and functional connectivity. Given prior observations that mTLE patients exhibit impairments in vigilance, and that seizures may disrupt the activity and long-range connectivity of subcortical brain structures involved in vigilance regulation, we propose that subcortical activating networks underlying vigilance play a critical role in mediating the widespread neural and cognitive effects of focal mTLE. Here, we review evidence for impaired vigilance in mTLE, examine clinical implications and potential network underpinnings, and suggest neuroimaging strategies for determining the relationship between vigilance, brain connectivity, and neurocognition in patients and healthy controls.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is typically unwitnessed but can be preceded by seizures in the period prior to death. Peri-ictal respiratory dysfunction is a likely mechanism for some SUDEP, and central apnea has been shown following amygdala stimulation. The amygdala is enriched in neuropeptides that modulate neuronal activity and can be transiently depleted following seizures. In a postmortem SUDEP series, we sought to investigate alterations of neuropeptidergic networks in the amygdala, including cases with recent poor seizure control. METHODS: In 15 SUDEP cases, 12 epilepsy controls, and 10 nonepilepsy controls, we quantified the labeling index (LI) for galanin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and somatostatin (SST) in the lateral, basal, and accessory basal nuclei and periamygdala cortex with whole slide scanning image analysis. Within the SUDEP group, seven had recent generalized seizures with recovery 24 hours prior to death (SUDEP-R). RESULTS: Galanin, NPY, and SST LIs were significantly lower in all amygdala regions in SUDEP cases compared to epilepsy controls (P < .05 to P < .0005), and galanin LI was lower in the lateral nucleus compared to nonepilepsy controls (P < .05). There was no difference in the LI in the SUDEP-R group compared to other SUDEP. Higher LI was noted in epilepsy controls than nonepilepsy controls; this was significant for NPY in lateral and basal nuclei (P < .005 and P < .05). SIGNIFICANCE: A reduction in galanin in the lateral nucleus in SUDEP could represent acute depletion, relevant to postictal amygdala dysfunction. In addition, increased amygdala neuropeptides in epilepsy controls support their seizure-induced modulation, which is relatively deficient in SUDEP; this could represent a vulnerability factor for amygdala dysfunction in the postictal period.",

abstract = "The mechanism(s) for sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remain(s) unknown, but seizure spread to brainstem areas serving autonomic and respiratory function is critical. In a rat model, we established a mechanism for SUDEP that involves seizure-induced laryngospasm and obstructive apnea lasting until respiratory arrest. We hypothesized that DBA/2J mice, which display lethal audiogenic seizures, would be protected from death by implanting a tracheal T-tube as a surrogate airway. In a 2 $\times$ 2 design, mice were implanted with either open or closed tracheal T-tubes and treated with either low-dose ketamine/xylazine to moderate thoracic spasm during the tonic seizure phase or no drug. Animals receiving both treatments had the highest survival rate, followed by animals receiving the open tube without ketamine/xylazine. The odds ratio for survival was >20 higher with an open T-tube (odds ratio = 24.14). The impact of open tracheal tubes indicates that the mechanism of death in DBA/2J mice involves seizure-induced upper airway obstruction until respiratory arrest. These results, our rat work, and our demonstration of inspiratory effort-based electromyographic signals and electrocardiographic abnormalities in rats and humans suggest that seizure-induced laryngospasm and obstructive apnea directly link seizure activity to respiratory arrest in these sudden death examples.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Mouse models of sudden unexpected death in epileptic patients (SUDEP) using audiogenic seizures (AGS) are valuable because death can occur following a sound-induced seizure in the absence of any pharmacologic or electric component. However, only a few strains of mice are AGS prone, and the vast majority of studies involve DBA/2 or DBA/1 inbred strains. With the goal of characterizing the variation of AGS susceptibility with age, and of offering a larger panel of mice available for AGS studies, we performed a comparative study of the variability in AGS responses. METHODS: The variation of AGS with age was determined in two classically used inbred strains of mice, DBA/2 and DBA/1, and two additional strains, BALB/c and 129/SvTer. As AGS-stimulated tonic seizures can be lethal or nonlethal, even in the same inbred strain, in a second experiment, we addressed whether there is an innate capacity to reproduce the same response after a tonic AGS, referred to as ``determinism,'' in the DBA/2J, DBA/1J, and 129/SvTer mouse strains. RESULTS: Results show that the 129/SvTer mouse is a more versatile model of SUDEP due to its wider age range of susceptibility compared to the DBA/2J and DBA/1J mouse strains. In addition, we show that determinism is not consistently evident in DBA/2J and 129/SvTer strains after AGS. Hence, one cannot be certain that a lethal AGS will always be lethal in successive testing after resuscitation and vice versa in these two mouse strains. SIGNIFICANCE: These studies highlight the phenotypic variability of AGS in different mouse strains, show the value of an additional mouse strain, 129/SvTer, for studies using AGS, and thus provide valuable information for future studies of AGS and SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Immediately preceding sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), patients experienced a final generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS), rapid ventilation, apnea, bradycardia, terminal apnea, and asystole. Whether a progressive pathophysiology develops and increases risk of SUDEP remains unknown. Here, we determined (a) heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) in low-risk and high-risk knockout (KO) mice; and (b) whether blocking receptors for orexin, a cardiorespiratory neuromodulator, influences cardiorespiratory function mice or longevity in high-risk KO mice. METHODS: Heart rate and SaO2 were determined noninvasively with ECGenie and pulse oximetry. Respiration was determined with noninvasive airway mechanics technology. The role of orexin was determined within subject following acute treatment with a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA, 100 mg/kg). The number of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus was determined with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Intermittent bradycardia was more prevalent in high-risk KO mice, an effect that may be the result of increased parasympathetic drive. High-risk KO mice had more orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Blocking of orexin receptors differentially influenced heart rate in KO, but not wild-type (WT) mice. When DORA administration increased heart rate, it also decreased heart rate variability, breathing frequency, and/or hypopnea-apnea. Blocking orexin receptors prevented the methacholine (MCh)-induced increase in breathing frequency in KO mice and reduced MCh-induced seizures, via a direct or indirect mechanism. DORA improved oxygen saturation in KO mice with intermittent hypoxia. Daily administration of DORA to high-risk KO mice increased longevity. SIGNIFICANCE: High-risk KO mice have a unique cardiorespiratory phenotype that is characterized by progressive changes in five interdependent endpoints. Blocking of orexin receptors attenuates some of these endpoints and increases longevity, supporting the notion that windows of opportunity for intervention exist in this preclinical SUDEP model.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine if closed-loop optogenetic seizure intervention, previously shown to reduce seizure duration in a well-established mouse model chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), also improves the associated comorbidity of impaired spatial memory. METHODS: Mice with chronic, spontaneous seizures in the unilateral intrahippocampal kainic acid model of TLE, expressing channelrhodopsin in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, were implanted with optical fibers and electrodes, and tested for response to closed-loop light intervention of seizures. Animals that responded to closed-loop optogenetic curtailment of seizures were tested in the object location memory test and then given closed-loop optogenetic intervention on all detected seizures for 2 weeks. Following this, they were tested with a second object location memory test, with different objects and contexts than used previously, to assess if seizure suppression can improve deficits in spatial memory. RESULTS: Animals that received closed-loop optogenetic intervention performed significantly better in the second object location memory test compared to the first test. Epileptic controls with no intervention showed stable frequency and duration of seizures, as well as stable spatial memory deficits, for several months after the precipitating insult. SIGNIFICANCE: Many currently available treatments for epilepsy target seizures but not the associated comorbidities, therefore there is a need to investigate new potential therapies that may be able to improve both seizure burden and associated comorbidities of epilepsy. In this study, we showed that optogenetic intervention may be able to both shorten seizure duration and improve cognitive outcomes of spatial memory.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The ``adenosine hypothesis of SUDEP'' (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy) predicts that a seizure-induced adenosine surge combined with impaired metabolic clearance can foster lethal apnea or cardiac arrest. Changes in adenosine receptor density and adenosine kinase (ADK) occur in surgical epilepsy patients. Our aim was to correlate the distribution of ADK and adenosine A2A and A1 receptors (A2A R and A1 R) in surgical tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (TLE/HS) with SUDEP risk factors. METHODS: In 75 cases, patients were stratified into high-risk (n = 16), medium-risk (n = 11) and low-risk (n = 48) categories according to the frequency of generalized seizures before surgery. Using whole-slide scanning Definiens image analysis we quantified the labeling index (LI) for ADK, A2A R, and A1 R in seven regions of interest: temporal cortex, temporal lobe white matter, CA1, CA4, dentate gyrus, subiculum, and amygdala and relative to glial and neuronal densities with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN). RESULTS: A1 R showed predominant neuronal, A2A R astroglial, and ADK nuclear labeling in all regions but with significant variation. Compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk group had significantly lower A2A R LI in the temporal cortex. In HS cases with severe neuronal cell loss and gliosis predominantly in the CA1 and CA4 regions, significantly higher A1 R was present in the amygdala in high-risk than in low-risk cases. There was no significant difference in neuronal loss or gliosis between the risk groups or differences for ADK labeling. SIGNIFICANCE: Reduced cortical A2A R suggests glial dysfunction and impaired adenosine modulation in response to seizures in patients at higher risk for SUDEP. Increased neuronal A1 R in the high-risk group could contribute to periictal amygdala dysfunction in SUDEP.",

abstract = "This study aims at defining objective parameters reflecting the severity of peri-ictal autonomic changes and their relation to post-ictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES), with the view that such changes could be detected by wearable seizure detection systems and prove useful to assess the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). To this purpose, we assessed peri-ictal changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and correlated them with seizure duration, intensity of electromyography-based ictal muscle activity, and presence and duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES). We evaluated 75 motor seizures from 40 patients, including 61 generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and 14 other major motor seizure types. For all major motor seizures, HRV measurements demonstrated a significantly decreased parasympathetic activity and increased sympathetic activity in the post-ictal period. The post-ictal increased sympathetic activity was significantly higher for GTCS as compared with non-GTCS. The degree of peri-ictal decreased parasympathetic activity and increased sympathetic activity was associated with longer PGES (>20 s), longer seizure duration, and greater intensity of ictal muscle activity. Mean post-ictal heart rate (HR) was an independent predictor of PGES duration, seizure duration, and intensity of ictal muscle contraction. Our results indicate that peri-ictal changes in HRV are potential biomarkers of major motor seizure severity.",

abstract = "Besides triggering alarms, wearable seizure detection devices record a variety of biosignals that represent biomarkers of seizure severity. There is a need for automated seizure characterization, to identify high-risk seizures. Wearable devices can automatically identify seizure types with the highest associated morbidity and mortality (generalized tonic-clonic seizures), quantify their duration and frequency, and provide data on postictal position and immobility, autonomic changes derived from electrocardiography/heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, respiration, and oxygen saturation. In this review, we summarize how these biosignals reflect seizure severity, and how they can be monitored in the ambulatory outpatient setting using wearable devices. Multimodal recording of these biosignals will provide valuable information for individual risk assessment, as well as insights into the mechanisms and prevention of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",

author = "Park, Katherine and Kanth, Kiran and Bajwa, Sami and Girgis, Fady and Shahlaie, Kiarash and Seyal, Masud",
abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a frequent cause of death in epilepsy. Respiratory dysfunction is implicated as a critical factor in SUDEP pathophysiology. Human studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the amygdala resulted in apnea, indicating that the amygdala has a role in respiration control. Unilateral amygdala stimulation resulted in immediate onset of respiratory dysfunction occurring only during nose breathing. In small numbers of patients, some but not all spontaneous seizures resulted in apnea occurring shortly after seizure spread to the amygdala. With this study we aimed to determine whether seizure onset or spread to the amygdala was necessary and sufficient to cause apnea. METHODS: We investigated the temporal relationship between apnea/hypopnea (AH) onset and initial seizure involvement within the amygdala in patients with implanted depth electrodes. RESULTS: Data from 17 patients (11 female) with 47 seizures were analyzed. With seven seizures (three patients), AH preceded amygdala seizure involvement by 2 to 55 seconds. There was no AH with four seizures (three patients) that involved the amygdala. With eight seizures (four patients) AH occurred within 2 seconds following amygdala seizure onset. With 28 seizures, AH started >2 seconds after amygdala seizure onset (range 3-158 seconds). Following seizure onset, there was a significant difference between AH onset time and amygdala seizure onset (P < .001). The mean $\pm$ standard deviation (SD) AH onset was 27.8 $\pm$ 41.06 seconds, and the mean time to amygdala involvement was 8.83 $\pm$ 20.19 seconds. SIGNIFICANCE: There is a wide range of AH onset times relative to amygdala seizure involvement. With some seizures, amygdala seizure involvement occurs without AH. With other seizures, AH precedes amygdala seizures, suggesting that, with spontaneous seizures, involvement of the amygdala may not be crucial to induction of AH with all seizures. Other pathophysiology impacting brainstem respiratory networks may be of greater relevance to seizure-triggered apneas.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Movement-based wearable sensors are used for detection of convulsive seizures. The identification of the absence of motion following a seizure, known as post-ictal immobility (PI), may represent a potential additional application of wearables. PI has been associated with potentially life-threatening complications and with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We aimed to assess whether wearable accelerometers (ACCs) could be used as a digital marker of PI. METHOD: Devices with embedded ACCs were worn by patients admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit. Participants presenting with convulsive seizures were included in the study. PI presence and duration were assessed by experts reviewing video recordings. An algorithm for the automatic detection of post-ictal ACC silence and its duration was developed and the linear pairwise relationship between the automatically detected duration of post-ictal ACC silence and the duration of the expert-labeled PI was analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-two convulsive seizures were recorded from 18 study participants. Twenty were followed by PI and two by agitation. The automated estimation of post-ictal ACC silence identified all the 20 expert-labeled PI. The regression showed that the duration of the post-ictal ACC silence was correlated with the duration of PI (Pearson r = .92; P < .001), with the age of study participants (Pearson r = .78; P < .001), and with the duration of post-ictal generalized electroencephalography suppression (PGES; Pearson r = .4; P = .033). SIGNIFICANCE: We highlight a novel application of wearables as a way to record post-ictal manifestations associated with an increased risk of SUDEP. The occurrence of a fatal seizure is unpredictable and the continuous, non-invasive, long-term identification of risk factors associated with each individual seizure may assume a great clinical importance.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Hypoxia, or abnormally low blood-oxygen levels, often accompanies seizures and may elicit brain structural changes in people with epilepsy which contribute to central processes underlying sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The extent to which hypoxia may be related to brain structural alterations in this patient group remains unexplored. METHODS: We analyzed high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine brain morphometric and volumetric alterations in people with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) recorded during long-term video-electroencephalography (VEEG), recruited from two sites (n = 22), together with data from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 43). Subjects were sub-divided into those with mild/moderate (GTCS-hypox-mild/moderate, n = 12) and severe (GTCS-hypox-severe, n = 10) hypoxia, measured by peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) during VEEG. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and regional volumetry were used to assess group comparisons and correlations between brain structural measurements as well as the duration and extent of hypoxia during GTCS. RESULTS: Morphometric and volumetric alterations appeared in association with peri-GTCS hypoxia, including volume loss in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), thalamus, hypothalamus, vermis, cerebellum, parabrachial pons, and medulla. Thalamic and PAG volume was significantly reduced in GTCS patients with severe hypoxia compared with GTCS patients with mild/moderate hypoxia. Brainstem volume loss appeared in both hypoxia groups, although it was more extensive in those with severe hypoxia. Significant negative partial correlations emerged between thalamic and hippocampal volume and extent of hypoxia, whereas vermis and accumbens volumes declined with increasing hypoxia duration. SIGNIFICANCE: Brain structural alterations in patients with GTCS are related to the extent of hypoxia in brain sites that serve vital functions. Although the changes are associative only, they provide evidence of injury to regulatory brain sites related to respiratory manifestations of seizures.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Animal studies remain essential for understanding mechanisms of epilepsy and identifying new therapeutic targets. However, existing animal models of epilepsy do not reflect the high level of genetic diversity found in the human population. The Collaborative Cross (CC) population is a genetically diverse recombinant inbred panel of mice. The CC offers large genotypic and phenotypic diversity, inbred strains with stable genomes that allow for repeated phenotypic measurements, and genomic tools including whole genome sequence to identify candidate genes and candidate variants. METHODS: We evaluated multiple complex epileptic traits in a sampling of 35 CC inbred strains using the flurothyl-induced seizure and kindling paradigm. We created an F2 population of 297 mice with extreme seizure susceptibility and performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to identify genomic regions associated with seizure sensitivity. We used quantitative RNA sequencing from CC hippocampal tissue to identify candidate genes and whole genome sequence to identify genetic variants likely affecting gene expression. RESULTS: We identified new mouse models with extreme seizure susceptibility, seizure propagation, epileptogenesis, and SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy). We performed QTL mapping and identified one known and seven novel loci associated with seizure sensitivity. We combined whole genome sequencing and hippocampal gene expression to pinpoint biologically plausible candidate genes (eg, Gabra2) and variants associated with seizure sensitivity. SIGNIFICANCE: New mouse models of epilepsy are needed to better understand the complex genetic architecture of seizures and to identify therapeutics. We performed a phenotypic screen utilizing a novel genetic reference population of CC mice. The data we provide enable the identification of protective/risk genes and novel molecular mechanisms linked to complex seizure traits that are currently challenging to study and treat.",

abstract = "Although vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common procedure, seizure outcomes are heterogeneous, with few available means to preoperatively identify the ideal surgical candidate. Here, we perform a scoping review of the literature to identify biomarkers of VNS response in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Several databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, BIOSIS Previews, and Web of Science) were searched for all relevant articles that reported at least one biomarker of VNS response following implantation for intractable epilepsy. Patient demographics, seizure data, and details related to biomarkers were abstracted from all studies. From the 288 records screened, 28 articles reporting on 16 putative biomarkers were identified. These were grouped into four categories: network/connectomic-based biomarkers, electrophysiological signatures, structural findings on neuroimaging, and systemic assays. Differences in brain network organization, connectivity, and electrophysiological synchronicity demonstrated the most robust ability to identify VNS responders. Structural findings on neuroimaging yielded inconsistent associations with VNS responsiveness. With regard to systemic biomarkers, heart rate variability was shown to be an independent marker of VNS response, whereas inflammatory markers were not useful. There is an unmet need to preoperatively identify candidates who are likely to benefit from VNS. Several biomarkers demonstrate promise in predicting seizure responsiveness to VNS, particularly measures of brain network connectivity. Further efforts are required to validate existing biomarkers to inform clinical decision-making.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Dravet syndrome (Dravet) is a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy. The disease begins with a febrile stage, characterized by febrile seizures with otherwise normal development. Progression to the worsening stage features recurrent intractable seizures and the presentation of additional nonepileptic comorbidities, including global developmental delay, hyperactivity, and motor deficits. Later in life, at the stabilization stage, seizure burden decreases, whereas Dravet-associated comorbidities persist. To date, it remains debated whether the nonepileptic comorbidities result from severe epilepsy or represent an independent phenotypic feature. METHODS: Dravet mice (DS) faithfully recapitulate many clinical aspects of Dravet. Using wild-type (WT) and DS at different ages, we monitored multiple behavioral features as well as background electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during the different stages of Dravet epilepsy. RESULTS: Behavioral tests of WT and DS demonstrated that some deficits manifest already at the pre-epileptic stage, prior to the onset of convulsive seizures. These include motor impairment and hyperactivity in the open field. Deficits in cognitive functions were detected at the onset of severe spontaneous seizures. Power spectral analysis of background EEG activity, measured through development, showed that DS exhibit normal background oscillations at the pre-epileptic stage, a marked reduction in total power during the onset of severe epilepsy, and a subsequent smaller reduction later in life. Importantly, low EEG power at the stage of severe frequent convulsive seizures correlated with increased risk for premature death. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide a comprehensive developmental trajectory of Dravet epilepsy and Dravet-associated comorbidities in mice, under controlled settings, demonstrating that the convulsive seizures and some nonepileptic comorbidities may be uncoupled. Moreover, we report the existence of an inverse correlation, on average, between the power of background EEG and the severity of epileptic phenotypes, suggesting that such measurements may potentially serve as a biomarker for Dravet severity.",

author = "Shen, Wangzhen and Poliquin, Sarah and Macdonald, Robert L and Dong, Marco and Kang, Jing-Qiong",
abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Neuroinflammation is a major theme in epilepsy, which has been characterized in acquired epilepsy but is poorly understood in genetic epilepsy. $\gamma$-Aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit gene mutations are significant causes of epilepsy, and we have studied the pathophysiology directly resulting from defective receptor channels. Here, we determined the proinflammatory factors in a genetic mouse model, the Gabrg2+/Q390X knockin (KI). We have identified increased cytokines in multiple brain regions of the KI mouse throughout different developmental stages and propose that accumulation of the trafficking-deficient mutant protein may increase neuroinflammation, which would be a novel mechanism for genetic epilepsy. METHODS: We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoprecipitation, nuclei purification, immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy to characterize increased neuroinflammation and its potential causes in a Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mouse and a Gabrg2+/- knockout (KO) mouse, each associated with a different epilepsy syndrome with different severities. RESULTS: We found that proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1-beta (IL-1$\beta$), and IL-6 were increased in the KI mice but not in the KO mice. A major underlying basis for the discrepancy in cytokine expression between the two mouse models is likely chronic mutant protein accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The presence of mutant protein dampened cytokine induction upon further cellular stimulation or external stress such as elevated temperature. Pharmacological induction of ER stress upregulated cytokine expression in the wild-type and KO but not in the KI mice. The increased cytokine expression was independent of seizure occurrence, because it was upregulated in both mice and cultured neurons. SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these data demonstrate a novel pathophysiology for genetic epilepsy, increased neuroinflammation, which is a common mechanism for acquired epilepsy. The findings thus provide the first link of neuroinflammation between genetic epilepsy associated with an ion channel gene mutation and acquired epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have shown promising utility in the spatial localization of the seizure onset zone for patients with focal refractory epilepsy. Comparatively few studies have addressed potential temporal variations in HFOs, or their role in the preictal period. Here, we introduce a novel evaluation of the instantaneous HFO rate through interictal and peri-ictal epochs to assess their usefulness in identifying imminent seizure onset. METHODS: Utilizing an automated HFO detector, we analyzed intracranial electroencephalographic data from 30 patients with refractory epilepsy undergoing long-term presurgical evaluation. We evaluated HFO rates both as a 30-minute average and as a continuous function of time and used nonparametric statistical methods to compare individual and population-level differences in rate during peri-ictal and interictal periods. RESULTS: Mean HFO rate was significantly higher for all epochs in seizure onset zone channels versus other channels. Across the 30 patients of our cohort, we found no statistically significant differences in mean HFO rate during preictal and interictal epochs. For continuous HFO rates in seizure onset zone channels, however, we found significant population-wide increases in preictal trends relative to interictal periods. Using a data-driven analysis, we identified a subset of 11 patients in whom either preictal HFO rates or their continuous trends were significantly increased relative to those of interictal baseline and the rest of the population. SIGNIFICANCE: These results corroborate existing findings that HFO rates within epileptic tissue are higher during interictal periods. We show this finding is also present in preictal, ictal, and postictal data, and identify a novel biomarker of preictal state: an upward trend in HFO rate leading into seizures in some patients. Overall, our findings provide preliminary evidence that HFOs can function as a temporal biomarker of seizure onset.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy, stereotactic-electroencephalography (SEEG) can aid in localizing epileptogenic regions for surgical treatment. SEEG, however, requires long hospitalizations to record seizures, and ictal interpretation can be incomplete or inaccurate. Our recent work showed that non-directed resting-state analyses may identify brain regions as epileptogenic or uninvolved. Our present objective is to map epileptogenic networks in greater detail and more accurately identify seizure-onset regions using directed resting-state SEEG connectivity. METHODS: In 25 patients with focal epilepsy who underwent SEEG, 2 minutes of resting-state, artifact-free, SEEG data were selected and functional connectivity was estimated. Using standard clinical interpretation, brain regions were classified into four categories: ictogenic, early propagation, irritative, or uninvolved. Three non-directed connectivity measures (mutual information [MI] strength, and imaginary coherence between and within regions) and four directed measures (partial directed coherence [PDC] and directed transfer function [DTF], inward and outward strength) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to generate a predictive model of ictogenicity. RESULTS: Ictogenic regions had the highest and uninvolved regions had the lowest MI strength. Although both PDC and DTF inward strengths were highest in ictogenic regions, outward strengths did not differ among categories. A model incorporating directed and nondirected connectivity measures demonstrated an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.88 in predicting ictogenicity of individual regions. The AUC of this model was 0.93 when restricted to patients with favorable postsurgical seizure outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: Directed connectivity measures may help identify epileptogenic networks without requiring ictal recordings. Greater inward but not outward connectivity in ictogenic regions at rest may represent broad inhibitory input to prevent seizure generation.",

In 220 SUDEP cases with post-mortem examination, we recorded the epileptologist adjudications and medical examiner- and coroner- (ME/C) listed causes of death (CODs).

Possible SUDEP cases, an understudied group, were significantly older, and had higher rates of cardiac, drug, or toxicology findings than more certain SUDEP cases. With a potentially contributing or competing COD, ME/Cs favored non-epilepsy-related diagnoses, suggesting a bias toward listing CODs with structural or toxicological findings; SUDEP has no pathognomonic features.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a diagnosis of exclusion; the definition includes individuals with epilepsy who die suddenly without an identifiable toxicological or anatomical cause of death. Limited data suggest underidentification of SUDEP as the cause of death on death certificates. Here, we evaluate the autopsy-reported cause of death in a population-based cohort of SUDEP cases. METHODS: Case summaries of forensic autopsies conducted in Ontario, Canada between January 2014 and June 2016 were retrospectively screened using a language processing script for decedents with a history of epilepsy or seizures. After manual review for potential SUDEP cases, two neurologists independently examined the autopsy reports and classified deaths by Nashef criteria. Demographic characteristics and consideration by the forensic pathologist of the role of epilepsy, seizure, and SUDEP in death were summarized. RESULTS: One hundred and eight Definite, 34 Definite Plus, and 22 Possible SUDEP cases were identified. Seventy-five percent of Definite/Definite Plus SUDEP cases identified by the neurologists were attributed to SUDEP, epilepsy, or seizure disorder in the autopsy report. There was a significant association between the proportion of cases listed in the autopsy report as SUDEP, epilepsy, or seizure disorder and neurologists' SUDEP classification (86\% of Definite, 38\% of Definite Plus, 0\% of Possible). Age was significantly associated with SUDEP classification; Definite cases were younger than Definite Plus, which were younger than Possible SUDEP cases. SIGNIFICANCE: Most SUDEP cases identified by neurologists were classified concordantly by forensic pathologists in Ontario, Canada; however, concordance decreased with increased case complexity. Although the role of epilepsy/seizures was considered in most Definite/Definite Plus cases, this study highlights the need for autopsy report review of potential SUDEP cases in research studies and assessments of the public health burden of SUDEP. The relationship between age and SUDEP classification has important public health implications; SUDEP incidence may be underappreciated in older adults.",

Early diagnosis and initiation of immunotherapy is associated with a favorable outcome in immune-mediated seizures. Patients with refractory focal epilepsy with neuronal antibodies (Abs) tend to have a worse surgical prognosis when compared to other etiologies. METHODS: We studied the prevalence of serum Abs in patients $\geq$18 years of age with DRE of unknown cause before surgery. We proposed and calculated a clinical APES (Antibody Prevalence in Epilepsy before Surgery) score for each subject, which was modified based on Dubey's previously published APE2 score. RESULTS`: A total of 335 patients were screened and 86 subjects were included in final analysis. The mean age at the time of recruitment was 44.84 $\pm$ 14.86 years, with age at seizure onset 30.89 $\pm$ 19.88 years. There were no significant differences among baseline clinical features between retrospective and prospective sub-cohorts. The prevalence of at least one positive Ab was 33.72\%, and central nervous system (CNS)-specific Abs was 8.14\%. APES score $\geq$4 showed slightly better overall prediction (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.84 vs 0.74) and higher sensitivity (100\% vs 71.4\%), with slightly lower but similar specificity (44.3\% vs 49.4\%), when compared to APE2 score $\geq$4. For subjects who had available positron emission tomography (PET) results and all components of APES score (n = 60), the sensitivity of APES score $\geq$4 yielded a similar prediction potential with an AUC of 0.80. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provide persuasive evidence that a subset of patients with focal DRE have potentially immune-mediated causes.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that death with physiological parallels to human cases of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) can be induced in seizing rats by ictal activation of oxygen-conserving reflexes (OCRs). METHODS: Urethane-anesthetized female Long-Evans rats were implanted with electrodes for electrocardiography (ECG), electrocorticography (ECoG), and respiratory thermocouple; venous and arterial cannulas; and a laryngoscope guide and cannula or nasal cannula for activation of the laryngeal chemoreflex (LCR) or mammalian diving reflex (MDR), respectively. Kainic acid injection, either systemic or into the ventral hippocampus, induced prolonged acute seizures. RESULTS: Reflex challenges during seizures caused sudden death in 18 of 20 rats-all MDR rats (10) and all but two LCR rats (8) failed to recover from ictal activation of OCRs and died within minutes of the reflexes. By comparison, 4 of 4 control (ie, nonseizing) rats recovered from 64 induced diving reflexes (16 per rat), and 4 of 4 controls recovered from 64 induced chemoreflexes (16 per rat). Multiple measures were consistent with reports of human SUDEP. Terminal central apnea preceded terminal asystole in all cases. Heart and respiratory rate fluctuations that paralleled those seen in human SUDEP occurred during OCR-induced sudden death, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was predictive of death, showing a 17 or 15 mm Hg drop (MDR and LCR, respectively) in the 20 s window centered on the time of brain death. OCR activation was never fatal in nonseizing rats. SIGNIFICANCE: These results present a method of inducing sudden death in two seizure models that show pathophysiology consistent with that observed in human cases of SUDEP. This proposed mechanism directly informs previous findings by our group and others in the field; provides a repeatable, inducible animal model for the study of sudden death; and offers a potential explanation for observations made in cases of human SUDEP.",

abstract = "Although seizures are common in children, they are often overlooked as a potential cause of death. Febrile and nonfebrile seizures can be fatal in children with or without an epilepsy diagnosis and may go unrecognized by parents or physicians. Sudden unexpected infant deaths, sudden unexplained death in childhood, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy share clinical, neuropathological, and genetic features, including male predominance, unwitnessed deaths, death during sleep, discovery in the prone position, hippocampal abnormalities, and variants in genes regulating cardiac and neuronal excitability. Additionally, epidemiological studies reveal that miscarriages are more common among individuals with a personal or family history of epilepsy, suggesting that some fetal losses may result from epileptic factors. The spectrum of seizure-related deaths in pediatrics is wide and underappreciated; accurately estimating this mortality and understanding its mechanism in children is critical to developing effective education and interventions to prevent these tragedies.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Caffeine is an antagonist of the adenosine pathway, which is involved in regulation of breathing. Extracellular concentrations of adenosine are increased in the immediate aftermath of a seizure. Seizure-related overstimulation of adenosine receptors might promote peri-ictal apnea. However, the relation between caffeine consumption and risk of seizure-related respiratory dysfunction in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy remains unknown. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in patients included in the SAVE study in Lyon's epilepsy monitoring unit at the Adult Epilepsy Department of the Lyon University Hospital between February 2016 and October 2018. The video-electroencephalographic recordings of 156 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy included in the study were reviewed to identify those with $\geq$1 focal seizure (FS), valid pulse oximetry (SpO2 ) measurement, and information about usual coffee consumption. This latter was collected at inclusion using a standardized self-questionnaire and further classified into four groups: none, rare ($\leq$3 cups/week), moderate (4 cups/week to 3 cups/day), and high ($\geq$4 cups/day). Peri-ictal hypoxemia (PIH) was defined as SpO2 < 90\% for at least 5 s occurring during the ictal period, the post-ictal period, or both. RESULTS: Ninety patients fulfilled inclusion criteria, and 323 seizures were analyzed. Both the level of usual coffee consumption (p = .033) and the level of antiepileptic drug withdrawal (p = .004) were independent risk factors for occurrence of PIH. In comparison with FS in patients with no coffee consumption, risk of PIH was four times lower in FS in patients with moderate consumption (odds ratio [OR] = .25, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = .07-.91, p = .036) and six times lower in FS in patients with high coffee consumption (OR = .16, 95\% CI = .04-.66, p = .011). However, when PIH occurred, its duration was longer in patients with moderate or high consumption than in those with no coffee consumption (p = .042). SIGNIFICANCE: Coffee consumption may be a protective factor for seizure-related respiratory dysfunction, with a dose-dependent effect.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Daytime and nighttime patterns affect the dynamic modulation of brain and body functions and influence the autonomic nervous system response to seizures. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate 24-hour patterns of electrodermal activity (EDA) in patients with and without seizures. METHODS: We included pediatric patients with (a) seizures (SZ), including focal impaired awareness seizures (FIAS) or generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), (b) no seizures and normal electroencephalography (NEEG), or (c) no seizures but epileptiform activity in the EEG (EA) during vEEG monitoring. Patients wore a device that continuously recorded EDA and temperature (TEMP). EDA levels, EDA spectral power, and TEMP levels were analyzed. To investigate 24-hour patterns, we performed a nonlinear mixed-effects model analysis. Relative mean pre-ictal (-30 min to seizure onset) and post-ictal (I: 30 min after seizure offset; II: 30 to 60 min after seizure offset) values were compared for SZ subgroups. RESULTS: We included 119 patients (40 SZ, 17 NEEG, 62 EA). EDA level and power group-specific models (SZ, NEEG, EA) (h = 1; P < .01) were superior to the all-patient cohort model. Fifty-nine seizures were analyzed. Pre-ictal EDA values were lower than respective 24-hour modulated SZ group values. Post hoc comparisons following the period-by-seizure type interaction (EDA level: $\chi$ 2 = 18.50; P < .001, and power: $\chi$ 2 = 6.73; P = .035) revealed that EDA levels were higher in the post-ictal period I for FIAS and GTCS and in post-ictal period II for GTCS only compared to the pre-ictal period. SIGNIFICANCE: Continuously monitored EDA shows a pattern of change over 24 hours. Curve amplitudes in patients with recorded seizures were lower as compared to patients who did not exhibit seizures during the recording period. Sympathetic skin responses were greater and more prolonged in GTCS compared to FIAS. EDA recordings from wearable devices offer a noninvasive tool to continuously monitor sympathetic activity with potential applications for seizure detection, prediction, and potentially sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk estimation.",

Postictal phenomena such as postconvulsive immobility (PI), postictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES), arousal deficits, cardiac arrhythmias, central apneas, and obstructive apneas due to laryngospasms have been suggested to contribute to SUDEP. We present, to our knowledge, the first case of a near-SUDEP event in a patient undergoing intracranial, stereotactic EEG (sEEG) monitoring. This case spotlights potential mediators of SUDEP, most notably the striking PGES and postictal apnea. The nature of the sEEG investigation illustrates the extent of cortical and subcortical postictal EEG suppression and showcases a transient return of cerebral activity likely to be missed on scalp-EEG recording. Critically, this case emphasizes the importance of continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring and underscores the importance of postictal arousal as a pathophysiological mechanism in SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) is one of the most common underlying pathologies in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, mechanistic understanding of FCDII fails to keep pace with genetic discoveries, primarily due to the significant challenge in developing a clinically relevant animal model. Conceptually and clinically important questions, such as the unknown latent period of epileptogenesis and the controversial epileptogenic zone, remain unknown in all experimental FCDII animal models, making it even more challenging to investigate the underlying epileptogenic mechanisms. METHODS: In this study, we used continuous video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring to detect the earliest interictal and ictal events in a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-in utero electroporation (IUE) FCDII rat model that shares genetic, pathological, and electroclinical signatures with those observed in humans. We then took advantage of in vivo local field potential (LFP) recordings to localize the epileptogenic zone in these animals. RESULTS: To the best of our knowledge, we showed for the first time that epileptiform discharges emerged during the third postnatal week, and that the first seizure occurred as early as during the fourth postnatal week. We also showed that both interictal and ictal discharges are localized within the dysplastic cortex, concordant with human clinical data. SIGNIFICANCE: Together, our work identified the temporal and spatial frame of epileptogenesis in a highly clinically relevant FCDII animal model, paving the way for mechanistic studies at molecular, cellular, and circuitry levels.",

METHODS: A cohort of 402 adult patients with IGE from the Danish island Funen was matched with 4020 randomly selected geography-, age-, and sex-matched controls via the Danish Civil Registration System. Based on register data, we compared social status measured by cohabitant status, educational attainment, income, affiliation to labor market, and psychiatric comorbidity. RESULTS: As compared to controls, patients with IGE had similar cohabitant status but fewer children (no children: 59.0\% vs 50.9\%), and lower educational level (primary school only: 46.0\% vs 37.3\%), employment rate (outside of workforce: 56.7\% vs 46.5\%), and income (low income: 32.6\% vs 24.9\%) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Having IGE was associated with higher a proportion of psychiatric comorbidity (IGE, 22.6\%; controls, 13.0\%) (P < 0.001). Seizure-free patients did not differ from controls; patients with persistent seizures had lower incomes and employment rates. In the IGE subgroup analyses, JME was associated with worse social status in all parameters studied (eg, 65.9\% of JME patients were outside the workforce vs 44.5\% of matched controls; P < 0.001), whereas no adverse social status was identified in patients with EGTCS and JAE. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with IGE in general and JME in particular have poorer social status and more psychiatric comorbidity than matched population controls without epilepsy. Poor seizure control was associated with social status and may contribute to negative socioeconomic consequences associated with IGE.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Markers of seizure recurrence are needed to personalize antiseizure medication (ASM) therapy. In the clinical practice, EEG features are considered to be related to the risk of seizure recurrence for genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE). However, to our knowledge, there are no studies analyzing systematically specific EEG features as indices of ASM efficacy in GGE. In this study, we aimed at identifying EEG indicators of ASM responsiveness in Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), which, among GGE, is characterized by specific electroclinical features. METHODS: We compared the features of prolonged ambulatory EEG (paEEG, 22 h of recording) of JME patients experiencing seizure recurrence within a year (``cases'') after EEG recording, with those of patients with sustained seizure freedom for at least 1 year after EEG (``controls''). We included only EEG recordings of patients who had maintained the same ASM regimen (dosage and type) throughout the whole time period from the EEG recording up to the outcome events (which was seizure recurrence for the ``cases'', or 1-year seizure freedom for ``controls''). As predictors, we evaluated the total number, frequency, mean and maximum duration of epileptiform discharges (EDs) and spike density (i.e. total EDs duration/artifact-free EEG duration) recorded during the paEEG. The same indexes were assessed also in standard EEG (stEEG), including activation methods. RESULTS: Both the maximum length and the mean duration of EDs recorded during paEEG significantly differed between cases and controls; when combined in a binary logistic regression model, the maximum length of EDs emerged as the only valid predictor. A cut-off of EDs duration of 2.68 seconds discriminated between cases and controls with a 100\% specificity and a 93\% sensitivity. The same indexes collected during stEEG lacked both specificity and sensitivity. SIGNIFICANCE: The occurrence of prolonged EDs in EEG recording might represent an indicator of antiepileptic drug failure in JME patients.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The clinical features of epilepsy determine how it is defined, which in turn guides management. Therefore, consideration of the fundamental clinical entities that comprise an epilepsy is essential in the study of causes, trajectories, and treatment responses. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is used widely in clinical and research genetics for concise communication and modeling of clinical features, allowing extracted data to be harmonized using logical inference. We sought to redesign the HPO seizure subontology to improve its consistency with current epileptological concepts, supporting the use of large clinical data sets in high-throughput clinical and research genomics. METHODS: We created a new HPO seizure subontology based on the 2017 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Operational Classification of Seizure Types, and integrated concepts of status epilepticus, febrile, reflex, and neonatal seizures at different levels of detail. We compared the HPO seizure subontology prior to, and following, our revision, according to the information that could be inferred about the seizures of 791 individuals from three independent cohorts: 2 previously published and 150 newly recruited individuals. Each cohort's data were provided in a different format and harmonized using the two versions of the HPO. RESULTS: The new seizure subontology increased the number of descriptive concepts for seizures 5-fold. The number of seizure descriptors that could be annotated to the cohort increased by 40\% and the total amount of information about individuals' seizures increased by 38\%. The most important qualitative difference was the relationship of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure to generalized-onset and focal-onset seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: We have generated a detailed contemporary conceptual map for harmonization of clinical seizure data, implemented in the official 2020-12-07 HPO release and freely available at hpo.jax.org. This will help to overcome the phenotypic bottleneck in genomics, facilitate reuse of valuable data, and ultimately improve diagnostics and precision treatment of the epilepsies.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a significant cause of mortality in epilepsy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity of the SUDEP-7 inventory and its components as tools for predicting SUDEP risk, and to develop and validate an improved inventory. METHODS: The study included 28 patients who underwent video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring and later died of SUDEP, and 56 age- and sex-matched control patients with epilepsy. The SUDEP-7 score, its individual components, and an alternative inventory were examined as predictors of SUDEP. RESULTS: SUDEP-7 scores were significantly higher among SUDEP patients compared with controls, both at time of admission (p = 0.024) and most recent follow-up (p = 0.016). SUDEP-7 scores declined only among controls, who demonstrated reduced seizure frequency. Seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery was also associated with survival. Several components of the SUDEP-7 inventory were independently associated with higher risk of SUDEP, including more than three generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures (p = 0.002), one or more GTC seizures (p = 0.001), or one or more seizures of any type within the last year (p = 0.013), and intellectual disability (p = 0.031). In stepwise regression models, SUDEP-7 scores did not enhance the prediction of SUDEP over either GTC seizure frequency or seizure frequency alone. A novel SUDEP-3 inventory comprising GTC seizure frequency, seizure frequency, and intellectual disability (p < 0.001) outperformed the SUDEP-7 inventory (p = 0.010) in predicting SUDEP.

Neural mechanisms of semiologic production in epilepsy, especially for complex behaviors, remain poorly known. In a framework of epilepsy as a network rather than as a focal disorder, we can think of semiology as being dynamically produced by a set of interconnected structures, in which specific rhythmic interactions, and not just anatomical localization, are likely to play an important part in clinical expression. This requires a paradigm shift in how we think about seizure organization, including from a presurgical evaluation perspective. Semiology is a key data source, albeit with significant methodological challenges for its use in research, including observer bias and choice of semiologic categories. Better understanding of semiologic categorization and pathophysiological correlates is relevant to seizure classification systems. Advances in knowledge of neural mechanisms as well as anatomic correlates of different semiologic patterns could help improve knowledge of epilepsy networks and potentially contribute to therapeutic innovations.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Central CO2 chemoreception (CCR), a major chemical drive for breathing, can be quantified with a CO2 re-breathing test to measure the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR). An attenuated HCVR correlates with the severity of respiratory dysfunction after generalized convulsive seizures and is a potential biomarker for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may reduce SUDEP risk, but for unclear reasons the risk remains higher during the first 2 years after implantation. The vagus nerve has widespread connections in the brainstem, including key areas related to CCR. Here we examined whether chronic electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve induces changes in CCR. METHODS: We compared the HCVR in epilepsy patients with or without an active VNS in a sex- and age-matched case-control study. Eligible subjects were selected from a cohort of patients who previously underwent HCVR testing. The HCVR slope, change in minute ventilation (VE) with respect to change in end tidal (ET) CO2 (∆ VE/ ∆ ETCO2) during the test was calculated for each subject. Key variables were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out for HCVR slope as dependent variable. RESULTS: A total of 86 subjects were in the study. HCVR slope was significantly lower in the cases compared to the controls. Cases had longer duration of epilepsy and higher number of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) tried during lifetime. Having active VNS and ETCO2 were associated with a low HCVR slope while high BMI was associated with high HCVR slope in both univariate and multivariate analyses. DISCUSSION: We found having an active VNS was associated with relatively attenuated HCVR slope. Although duration of epilepsy and number of AEDs tried during lifetime was significantly different between the groups, they were not predictors of HCVR slope in subsequent analysis. CONCLUSION: Chronic electrical stimulation of VNS nerve by VNS may be associated with an attenuated CCR. A larger prospective study may help to establish the time course of this effect in relation to the time of VNS implantation, whether there is a causal relationship, and determine how it affects SUDEP risk.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The classical description of Dravet syndrome, the prototypic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, is of a normal 6-month-old infant presenting with a prolonged, febrile, hemiclonic seizure and showing developmental slowing after age 1 year. SCN1A pathogenic variants are found in >80\% of patients. Many patients have atypical features resulting in diagnostic delay and inappropriate therapy. We aimed to provide an evidence-based definition of SCN1A-Dravet syndrome in readiness for precision medicine trials. METHODS: Epilepsy patients were recruited to the University of Melbourne Epilepsy Genetics Research Program between 1995 and 2020 by neurologists from around the world. Patients with SCN1A pathogenic variants were reviewed and only those with Dravet syndrome were included. Clinical data, including seizure and developmental course, were analyzed in all patients with SCN1A-Dravet syndrome. RESULTS: Two hundred and five patients were studied at a median age of 8.5 years (range 10 months to 60 years); 25 were deceased. The median seizure-onset age was 5.7 months (range 1.5-20.6 months). Initial seizures were tonic-clonic (52\%) and hemiclonic (35\%), with only 55\% being associated with fever. Only 34\% of patients presented with status epilepticus (seizure lasting $\geq$30 minutes). Median time between first and second seizure was 30 days (range 4 hours to 8 months), and seven patients (5\%) had at least 6 months between initial seizures. Median ages at onset of second and third seizure types were 9.1 months (range 3 months-25.4 years) and 15.5 months (range 4 months-8.2 years), respectively. Developmental slowing occurred prior to 12 months in 27\%. SIGNIFICANCE: An evidence-based definition of SCN1A-Dravet syndrome is essential for early diagnosis. We refine the spectrum of Dravet syndrome, based on patterns of seizure onset, type, and progression. Understanding of the full spectrum of SCN1A-Dravet syndrome presentation is essential for early diagnosis and optimization of treatment, especially as precision medicine trials become available.",

At the end of the experimental procedure, we measured lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase activities in the hippocampus to assess oxidative stress. RESULTS: A. pyrethrum treatment significantly reduced seizure frequency by 51\% and 57\%, duration by 30\% and 33\%, and severity by 31\% and 26\% in isolated handled and unhandled rats, respectively. The beneficial effects on seizures were still present 3 weeks after the end of the treatment. The treatment reduced lipid peroxidation as well as SOD, GPx, and catalase activities. SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that A. pyrethrum has antiseizure and antioxidant properties, even in social isolation conditions.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Persons with epilepsy have an increased mortality including a high risk of sudden unexplained death (SUD), also referred to as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We aimed to evaluate the risk of SUDEP in comparison to other causes of death and the risk of SUD in persons with and without epilepsy. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective population-based cohort study of all Danish citizens with and without epilepsy aged 1-49 years during 2007-2009. All deaths in the population were evaluated, and all cases of SUD identified. Primary causes of death in persons with epilepsy were evaluated independently by three neurologists and one neuropediatrician, using the unified SUDEP criteria. RESULTS: The three most frequent causes of death in persons with epilepsy were cancer (2.38 per 1000 person-years), SUDEP (1.65 per 1000 person-years), and pneumonia (1.09 per 1000 person-years) compared with cancer (.17 per 1000 person-years), accident-related deaths (.14 per 1000 person-years), and cardiovascular disease (.09 per 1000 person-years) in persons without epilepsy. Considering definite, definite plus, and probable cases, the SUDEP incidence was .27 per 1000 person-years (95\% confidence interval [CI] = .11-.64) in children aged 1-17 years and 1.21 per 1000 person-years (95\% CI = .96-1.51) in adults aged 18-49 years. Adjusted for age and sex, persons with epilepsy younger than 50 years had a 10.8-fold (95\% CI = 9.97-11.64, p < .0001) increased all-cause mortality and a 34.4-fold (95\% CI = 23.57-50.28, p < .0001) increased risk of SUD compared with persons without epilepsy. SUDEP accounted for 23.3\% of all SUD. SIGNIFICANCE: This nationwide study of all deaths in persons with epilepsy younger than 50 years found a lower SUDEP risk in children compared with adults, and that epilepsy was a major risk factor for SUD in the background population. This underlines the importance of addressing risk factors for SUDEP to prevent premature death.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the rate of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) among patients presenting to an emergency department with presumed seizures. We also wanted to identify factors that can assist health care professionals in determining whether these events are likely to be epileptic or nonepileptic. METHODS: We performed two retrospective audits on patients who were treated for seizures in the department of emergency medicine at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Exploratory analyses and logistic regressions were conducted to investigate the characteristics of the presentations and the relationships between our variables of interest. RESULTS: In the group of all presentations with presumed seizures over a 3-month period (n = 157), a total of 151 presentations (96.2\%) presentations were given a primary diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Of these 151 presentations, only 84 (55.6\%) presented with epileptic seizures and 40 (26.5\%) actually presented with PNES. In the group of patients who presented with prolonged and/or multiple events (n = 213) over a 1-year period, 196 (92.0\%) were treated as epileptic seizures. Of these 196 presentations, only 85 (43.4\%) presented with epileptic seizures and 97 (49.5\%) actually presented with PNES. Several factors were identified to help risk stratify between epileptic seizures and PNES: Duration of events and of the postictal phase, number of events, presence of a structural brain pathology, mental health history, lactate levels and presence of tongue bite, incontinence, and/or vomiting. SIGNIFICANCE: A large proportion of people who present to emergency departments with events resembling epileptic seizures actually have PNES rather than epilepsy-particularly those patients who present with prolonged and/or multiple events. The rate of misdiagnosis was high. Efforts need to be made to recognize patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures earlier and diagnose them correctly to avoid unnecessary iatrogenic harm and to provide adequate treatment.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Dravet syndrome is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) most often caused by de novo pathogenic variants in SCN1A. Individuals with Dravet syndrome rarely achieve seizure control and have significantly elevated risk for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Heterozygous deletion of Scn1a in mice (Scn1a+/- ) recapitulates several core phenotypes, including temperature-dependent and spontaneous seizures, SUDEP, and behavioral abnormalities. Furthermore, Scn1a+/- mice exhibit a similar clinical response to standard anticonvulsants. Cholesterol 24-hydroxlase (CH24H) is a brain-specific enzyme responsible for cholesterol catabolism. Recent research has indicated the therapeutic potential of CH24H inhibition for diseases associated with neural excitation, including seizures. METHODS: In this study, the novel compound soticlestat, a CH24H inhibitor, was administered to Scn1a+/- mice to investigate its ability to improve Dravet-like phenotypes in this preclinical model. RESULTS: Soticlestat treatment reduced seizure burden, protected against hyperthermia-induced seizures, and completely prevented SUDEP in Scn1a+/- mice. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) analysis confirmed the ability of soticlestat to reduce occurrence of electroclinical seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that soticlestat-mediated inhibition of CH24H provides therapeutic benefit for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in mice and has the potential for treatment of DEEs.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to characterize antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment pathways in Medicare beneficiaries with newly treated epilepsy. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using Medicare claims. Medicare is the United States' federal health insurance program for people aged 65 years and older plus younger people with disabilities or end-stage renal disease. We included beneficiaries with newly treated epilepsy (International Classification of Diseases codes for epilepsy/convulsions 2014-2017, no ASM in the previous 2 years). We displayed the sequence of ASM fills using sunburst plots overall, then stratified by mood disorder, age, and neurologist prescriber. We tabulated drug costs for each pathway. RESULTS: We included 21 458 beneficiaries. Levetiracetam comprised the greatest number of pill days (56\%), followed by gabapentin (11\%) and valproate (8\%). There were 22 288 unique treatment pathways. The most common pathways were levetiracetam monotherapy (43\%), gabapentin monotherapy (10\%), and valproate monotherapy (5\%). Gabapentin was the most common second- and third-line ASM. Whereas only 2\% of pathways involved first-line lacosamide, those pathways accounted for 19\% of cost. Gabapentin and valproate use was increased and levetiracetam use was decreased in beneficiaries with mood disorders compared to beneficiaries without mood disorders. Levetiracetam use was increased and gabapentin, valproate, lamotrigine, and topiramate use was decreased in beneficiaries aged >65 years compared with those aged 65 years or less. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and lacosamide use was increased and gabapentin use was decreased in beneficiaries whose initial prescriber was a neurologist compared to those whose prescriber was not a neurologist. SIGNIFICANCE: Levetiracetam monotherapy was the most common pathway, although substantial heterogeneity existed. Lacosamide accounted for a small percentage of ASMs but a disproportionately large share of cost. Neurologists were more likely to prescribe lamotrigine compared with nonneurologists, and lamotrigine was prescribed far less frequently than may be endorsed by guidelines. Future work may explore patient- and physician-driven factors underlying ASM choices.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Increased understanding of the role of cortical structures in respiratory control may help the understanding of seizure-induced respiratory dysfunction that leads to sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The aim of this study was to characterize respiratory responses to electrical stimulation (ES), including inhibition and enhancement of respiration. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 19 consecutive patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing stereotactic EEG evaluation from June 2015 to June 2018. Inclusion criteria were patients $\geq$18 years and in whom ES was indicated for clinical mapping of ictal onset or eloquent cortex as part of the presurgical evaluation. ES was carried out at 50 Hz, 0.2 ms and 1-10 mA current intensity. Common brain regions sampled across all patients were- amygdala (AMY), hippocampus (HG), anterior cingulate gyrus (CING), orbitofrontal cortex (OrbF), temporal neocortex (TNC), temporal pole (TP) and entorhinal cortex (ERC). 755 stimulations were conducted. Quantitative analysis of breathing signal i.e., changes in breathing rate (BR), depth (TV), and minute ventilation (MV) was carried out during ES using the BreathMetrics breathing waveform analysis toolbox. Electrocardiogram, arterial oxygen saturation, end-tidal and transcutaneous carbon dioxide, nasal airflow, and abdominal and thoracic plethysmography were continuously monitored during stimulations. RESULTS: Electrical stimulation of TP and CING (at lower current strengths <3mA) increased TV and MV. At 7-10mA, CING decreased TV and MV. On the other hand, decreased TV and MV occurred with stimulation of mesial temporal structures such as AMY and HG. Breathing changes were dependent on stimulation intensity. Lateral temporal, entorhinal, and orbitofrontal cortices did not affect breathing either way. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that breathing responses other than apnea can be induced by ES. Identification of two regions, the temporal pole and anterior cingulate gyrus, for enhancement of breathing may be important in paving the way to future development of strategies for prevention of SUDEP.",

abstract = "Many brain insults and injuries are 'epileptogenic': they increase the risk of developing epilepsy. It is desirable to identify treatments that are 'antiepileptogenic': treatments that prevent the development of epilepsy, if administered after the occurrence of an epileptogenic insult. Current antiepileptic drugs are not antiepileptogenic, but evidence of antiepileptogenic efficacy is accumulating for a growing number of other compounds. From amongst these candidate compounds, statins are deserving of particular attention because statins are reported to be antiepileptogenic in more published studies and in a wider range of brain insults than any other individual or class of compounds. While many studies report the antiepileptogenic effect of statins, it is unclear how many studies provide evidence that statins exhibit the following two essential features of a clinically-viable antiepileptogenic drug: the drug must exert an antiepileptogenic effect even if it is initiated after the epileptogenic brain insult has already occurred, and the antiepileptogenic effect must endure even after the drug has been discontinued. In the current work, we interrogate published preclinical and clinical studies, to determine if statins fulfil these essential requirements. There are eight different statins in clinical use. To enable the clinical use of one of these statins for antiepileptogenesis, its antiepileptogenic effect will have to be established through future time- and resource-intensive clinical trials. Therefore, it is desirable to review published literature in order to determine which of the statins emerges as the most promising candidate for antiepileptogenic therapy. Hence, in the current work, we also collate and analyse published data-clinical and pre-clinical, direct and indirect-that helps answer the question: Which statin is the most promising candidate to take forward into an antiepileptogenesis clinical trial?",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To characterize spending for persons classified with seizure or epilepsy and determine if spending has increased over time. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we pooled data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) household component files for 2010 to 2018. We matched cases to controls on age and sex of a population-based sample of MEPS respondents (community-dwelling persons of all ages) with records associated with a medical event (e.g., outpatient visit; hospital inpatient) for seizure, epilepsy, or both. Outcomes were weighted to be representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized population. We estimated the treated prevalence of epilepsy and seizure, healthcare spending overall and by site of care, and trends in spending growth. RESULTS: We identified 1,078 epilepsy cases, and 2,344 seizure cases. Treated prevalence was 0.38\% (95\% CI =0.34-0.41) for epilepsy, 0.76\% (95\% CI=0.71-0.81) for seizure, and 1.14\% (95\% CI: 1.08-1.20) for epilepsy or seizure. The difference in annual spending for cases compared to controls was $4,580 (95\% CI: $3,362-$5,798) for epilepsy, $7,935 (95\% CI: $6,237-$9,634) for seizure, and $6,853 (95\% CI: $5,623-$8,084) for epilepsy or seizure, translating into aggregate costs of $5.4 billion, $19.0 billion, and $24.5 billion. From 2010 to 2018, the annual growth rate in total spending incurred for seizures and/or epilepsies was 7.6\% compared to 3.6\% among controls. SIGNIFICANCE: U.S. economic burden of seizures and/or epilepsies is substantial and warrants interventions focused on their unique and overlapping causes.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic studies have investigated whether social deprivation is associated with a higher incidence of epilepsy and results are conflicting, especially in children. The mechanisms underlying a potential association are unclear. This study examines whether there is an association between social deprivation and the incidence of first seizures (unprovoked and provoked) and new diagnosis of epilepsy by comparing incidence across an area-level measure of deprivation in a population-based cohort. METHODS: Multiple methods of case identification followed by individual case validation and classification were carried out in a defined geographical area (population 542,868) to identify all incident cases of first provoked and first unprovoked seizures and new diagnosis of epilepsy presenting during the calendar year 2017. An area-level relative deprivation index, based on ten indicators from census data, was assigned to each patient according to registered address and categorised into quintiles from most to least deprived. RESULTS: The annual incidence of first unprovoked seizures (n=372), first provoked seizures (n=189) and new diagnosis of epilepsy (n=336) was highest in the most deprived areas compared to the least deprived areas (incidence ratios of 1·79 (95\%CI 1·26, 2·52), 1·55 (95\%CI 1·04, 2·32) and 1·83 (95\%CI 1·28, 2·62), respectively). This finding was evident in both adults and children and in those with structural and unknown aetiologies of epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: The incidence of first seizures and new diagnosis of epilepsy is associated with more social deprivation. The reason for this higher incidence is likely multifactorial.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Existing data suggest that outcome of epilepsy presenting in the first few years of life carries a worse prognosis than later onset. However, studies are few and methods differ making interpretations of data uncertain. This study analyses outcome at age 7 and potential prognostic factors in a well characterized population-based cohort with epilepsy onset during the first 2 years of life. METHODS: An incidence cohort of 116 prospectively identified cases of epilepsy with seizure onset before age 2 years was described in a previous publication. Cases were originally retrieved from the Stockholm Incidence Registry of Epilepsy (SIRE), that registered all cases with a first unprovoked epileptic seizure from September 1, 2001 in Northern Stockholm. Data on treatment and outcome at age 7 years were collected from electronic medical records and through interviews with parents. Outcome and potential prognostic factors were analyzed with descriptive statistics and multivariable log binomial regression analysis. RESULTS: Eleven children (9.5\%) died before age 7. Polytherapy was common. Epilepsy surgery was performed in two children. At age 7 years 61/116 (53\%) children had been seizure free for the last 2 years or longer. Intellectual disability was diagnosed in 57/116 (49\%) children, autism spectrum disorder in 13 (11\%) and 38 (33\%) children had cerebral palsy. West syndrome had a similar seizure remission rate but a worse cognitive outcome. There was no difference in outcome between first and second year onset. Six predictors, including etiology, remained associated to two or more outcome variables after regression analysis. SIGNIFICANCE: About half of children with infantile-onset epilepsy will become seizure free and half of them will have intellectual disability. Etiology was confirmed as a major independent predictor of outcome. Our study contributes to a more firm knowledge-base when counselling parents of infants diagnosed with epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Dysfunctional connectivity and pre-existing structural abnormalities of central autonomic network regions (CAN) have been shown on MRI in sudden and unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and may be mechanistically relevant. In a previous post-mortem study we reported increased microglia in CAN regions, including the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in SUDEP. In this current study we investigated mTOR pathway activation and neuronal c-Fos activation in CAN regions in SUDEP compared to control groups. METHODS: In a series of 59 post-mortem cases (SUDEP (n=26), epilepsy controls (EPC) (n=14) and non-epilepsy controls (NEC) (n=19)) we quantified pS6-240/4, pS6-235/6 (markers of mTOR activation) and c-Fos neuronal densities and labelling index in the STG, anterior cingulate, insula, fronto-basal and pulvinar regions using immunohistochemistry with whole-slide automated image analysis. RESULTS: Significantly more pS6 positive neurones were present in the STG in cases with a history of recent seizures prior to death and also in SUDEP compared to other cause of death groups. No differences were noted for c-Fos neuronal labelling in any region between cause of death groups. Cortical neuronal hypertrophy in the STG was observed in some SUDEP cases and associated with pS6-240/4 expression. pS6-235/6 highlighted neuronal intranuclear inclusions, mainly in SUDEP cases and in the STG region. SIGNIFICANCE: Neuronal labelling for pS6 in the STG correlated with both seizure activity in the period prior to death and SUDEP. Further investigations are required to explore the significance of this region in terms of autonomic network dysfunction that may increase vulnerability for SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and depression are common comorbid disorders whose underlying shared neural network has yet to be determined. While animal studies demonstrate a role for the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST) in both seizures and depression, and humans clinical studies demonstrate a therapeutic effect of stimulating this region on treatment-resistant depression, the role for the dBNST in depressed and non-depressed TLE patients is still unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this structure is morphologically abnormal in these epilepsy patients, with an increased abnormality in TLE patients with comorbid depression. METHODS: In this case-controlled study, three Tesla structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from TLE patients with no depression (TLEonly), with depression (TLEdep) and healthy comparison subjects (HC). TLE subjects were recruited from the Yale University Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, diagnosed with the International League Against Epilepsy 2014 Diagnostic Guidelines, and confirmed by video electroencephalography. Diagnosis of major depressive disorder was confirmed by a trained neuropsychologist through a Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview based on the DSM-IV. The dBNST was delineated manually by reliable raters using Bioimage Suite software. RESULTS: The number of patients and subjects included 35 TLEonly patients, 20 TLEdep patients, and 102 HC subjects. Both TLEonly and TLEdep patients had higher dBNST volumes compared to HC subjects, unilaterally in the left hemisphere in the TLEonly patients (p=0.003), and bilaterally in the TLEdep patients (p<0·0001). Furthermore, the TLEdep patients had a higher dBNST volume than the TLEonly patients in the right hemisphere (p=0.02). SIGNIFICANCE: Here we demonstrate an abnormality of the dBNST in TLE patients, both without depression (left enlargement) and with depression (bilateral enlargement). Our results demonstrate this region to underlie both temporal lobe epilepsy with and without depression, implicating it as a target to treat the comorbidity between these two disorders.",

We correlated PGES duration to our previous RNAseq dataset for serotonin receptor expression and signaling pathways, as well as weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify correlated gene clusters. Results In hippocampus, 5HT2A protein by western blot positively correlated with PGES duration (p=0.0024, R2=0.52) but 5HT1A did not (p=0.87, R2=0.0020). In temporal cortex, 5HT1A and 5HT2A had lower expression and did not correlate with PGES duration. Histologically, PGES duration did not correlate with 5HT1A or 5HT2A expression in hippocampal CA4, dentate gyrus, or temporal cortex. RNAseq identified two serotonin receptors with expression that correlated to PGES duration in an exploratory analysis: HTR3B negatively correlated (p=0.043, R2=0.26) and HTR4 positively correlated (p=0.049, R2=0.25). WGCNA identified 4 modules correlated to PGES duration, including positive correlation to synaptic transcripts (p=0.040, corr.=0.52), particularly potassium channels (KCNA4, KCNC4, KCNH1, KCNIP4, KCNJ3, KCNJ6, KCNK1). No modules were associated with serotonin receptor signaling. Significance Higher hippocampal 5HT2A receptor protein and potassium channel transcripts may reflect underlying mechanisms contributing to or resulting from prolonged PGES. Future studies with larger cohorts should assess functional analyses and additional brain regions to elucidate mechanisms underlying PGES and SUDEP risk.",

abstract = "Individuals use the observation of a conspecific to learn new behaviors and skills in many species. Whether observational learning is affected in epilepsy is not known. Using the pilocarpine rat model of epilepsy, we assessed learning by observation in a spatial task. The task involves a naive animal observing a demonstrator animal seeking a reward at a specific spatial location. After five observational sessions, the observer is allowed to explore the rewarded space and look for the reward. Although control observer rats succeed in finding the reward when allowed to explore the rewarded space, epileptic animals fail. However, epileptic animals are able to successfully learn the location of the reward through their own experience after several trial sessions. Thus, epileptic animals show a clear deficit in learning by observation. This result may be clinically relevant, in particular in children who strongly rely on observational learning.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Postictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES) is a surrogate marker of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). It is still unclear which ictal phenomena lead to prolonged PGES and increased risk of SUDEP. Semiology features of generalized convulsive seizure (GCS type 1) have been reported as a predictor of prolonged PGES. Progressive slowing of clonic phase (PSCP) has been observed in GCSs, with gradually increasing inhibitory periods interrupting the tonic contractions. We hypothesized that PSCP is associated with prolonged PGES. METHODS: We analyzed 90 bilateral convulsive seizures in 50 consecutive patients (21 female; age: 11-62 years, median: 31 years) recruited to video-EEG monitoring. Five raters, blinded to all other data, independently assessed the presence of PSCP. PGES and seizure semiology were evaluated independently. We determined inter-rater agreement (IRA) for the presence of PSCP, and we evaluated its association, as well as that of other ictal features, with the occurrence of PGES, prolonged PGES ($\geq$20 s) and very prolonged PGES ($\geq$50 s) using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We found substantial IRA for the presence of PSCP (percent agreement: 80\%; beyond-chance agreement coefficient: .655). PSCP was an independent predictor of the occurrence of PGES and prolonged PGES (p < .001). All seizures with very prolonged PGES had PSCP. GCS type 1 was an independent predictor of occurrence of PGES (p = .02) and prolonged PGES (p = .03) but not of very prolonged PGES. Only half of the seizures with very prolonged PGES were GCS type 1. SIGNIFICANCE: PSCP predicts prolonged PGES, emphasizing the importance of gradually increasing inhibitory phenomena at the end of the seizures. Our findings shed more light on the ictal phenomena leading to increased risk of SUDEP. These phenomena may provide basis for algorithms implemented into wearable devices for identifying GCS with increased risk of SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Despite increased awareness of the serious epilepsy complication sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), a substantial population of people with epilepsy (PWE) remain poorly informed. Physicians indicate concern that SUDEP information may adversely affect patients' health and quality of life. We examined SUDEP awareness and the immediate and long-term effects of providing SUDEP information to PWE. METHODS: Baseline knowledge and behaviors among PWE and behavioral adjustments following the provision of SUDEP information were evaluated in a prospective, multicenter survey using the following validated scales: Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) for depression symptoms, the EuroQoL (EQ-5D) for health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a visual analog scale (VAS) for overall health, the revised Epilepsy Stigma Scale (rESS) for perceived stigma, and the Seizure Worry Scale for seizure-related worries. The prospective study collected data through semi-quantitative interviews before (baseline), immediately after (post), and 3 months after (3-month) the provision of SUDEP information. RESULTS: In total, 236 participants (mean age: 39.3 years, range: 18-77 years, 51.7\% women) were enrolled, and 205 (86.9\%) completed long-term, 3-month follow-up. One patient died from SUDEP before follow-up. No worsening symptoms from baseline to 3-month were observed on any scale. At baseline, 27.5\% of participants were aware of SUDEP. More than 85\% of participants were satisfied with receiving SUDEP information. Three-quarters of participants were not concerned by the information, and more than 80\% of participants recommended the provision of SUDEP information to all PWE. Although most patients reported no behavioral adjustments, 24.8\% reported strong behavioral adjustments at 3-month. SIGNIFICANCE: The provision of SUDEP information has no adverse effects on overall health, HRQoL, depressive symptoms, stigma, or seizure worry among PWE, who appreciate receiving information. SUDEP information provision might improve compliance among PWE and reduce but not eliminate the increased mortality risk.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The aim is to report the performance of an electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure-detector algorithm on data obtained with a wearable device (WD) in patients with focal refractory epilepsy and their experience. METHODS: Patients used a WD, the Sensor Dot (SD), to measure two channels of EEG using dry electrode patches during presurgical evaluation and at home for up to 8 months. An automated seizure detection algorithm flagged EEG regions with possible seizures, which we reviewed to evaluate the algorithm's diagnostic yield. In addition, we collected data on usability, side effects, and patient satisfaction with an electronic seizure diary application (Helpilepsy). RESULTS: Sixteen inpatients used the SD for up to 5 days and had 21 seizures. Sixteen outpatients used the device for up to 8 months and reported 101 focal impaired awareness seizures during the periods selected for analysis. Focal seizure detection sensitivity based on behind-the-ear EEG was 52\% in inpatients and 23\% in outpatients. False detections/h, positive predictive value (PPV), and F1 scores were 7.13\%, .11\%, and .002\% for inpatients and 7.77\%, .04\%, and .001\% for outpatients. Artifacts and low signal quality contributed to poor performance metrics. The seizure detector identified 19 nonreported seizures during sleep, when the signal quality was better. Regarding patients' experience, the likelihood of using the device at 6 months was 62\%, and side effects were the main reason for dropping out. Finally, daily and monthly questionnaire completion rates were 33\% and 65\%, respectively. SIGNIFICANCE: Focal seizure detection sensitivity based on behind-the-ear EEG was 52\% in inpatients and 23\% in outpatients, with high false alarm rates and low PPV and F1 scores. This unobtrusive wearable seizure detection device was well received but had side effects. The current workflow and low performance limit its implementation in clinical practice.

author = "Faingold, Carl L and Feng, Hua-Jun",
abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major cause of death in people with epilepsy (PWE). Postictal apnea leading to cardiac arrest is the most common sequence of terminal events in witnessed cases of SUDEP, and post-convulsive central apnea has been proposed as a potential biomarker of SUDEP susceptibility. Research in SUDEP animal models has led to the serotonin and adenosine hypotheses of SUDEP. These neurotransmitters influence respiration, seizures, and lethality in animal models of SUDEP, and are implicated in human SUDEP cases. Adenosine released during seizures is proposed to be an important seizure termination mechanism. However, adenosine also depresses respiration, and this effect is mediated, in part, by inhibition of neuronal activity in subcortical structures that modulate respiration, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Drugs that enhance the action of adenosine increase postictal death in SUDEP models. Serotonin is also released during seizures, but enhances respiration in response to elevated carbon dioxide level that often occur postictally. This effect of serotonin can potentially compensate, in part, for the adenosine-mediated respiratory depression, acting to facilitate autoresuscitation and other restorative respiratory response mechanisms. A number of drugs that enhance the action of serotonin prevent postictal death in several SUDEP models and reduce postictal respiratory depression in PWE. This effect of serotonergic drugs may be mediated, in part, by actions on brainstem sites that modulate respiration, including the PAG. Enhanced activity in the PAG increases respiration in response to hypoxia and other exigent conditions and can be activated by electrical stimulation. Thus, we propose the unifying hypothesis that seizure-induced adenosine release leads to respiratory depression. This can be reversed by serotonergic action on autoresuscitation and other restorative respiratory responses acting, in part, via the PAG. Therefore, we hypothesize that serotonergic or direct activation of this brainstem site may be a useful approach for SUDEP prevention.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related death in children and adults living with epilepsy. Several recent clinical practice guidelines have recommended that all individuals living with epilepsy and their caregivers be informed about SUDEP as a part of routine epilepsy counseling. Furthermore, several studies over the last two decades have explored the state of SUDEP counseling. Patients with epilepsy and their families want to be informed about the risk of SUDEP at or near the time of diagnosis, and preferably in person. Despite guideline recommendations, many pediatric and adult neurologists do not routinely inform individuals with epilepsy and their families about SUDEP. Some neurologists discuss SUDEP with only a subset of patients with epilepsy, such as those with risk factors like frequent generalized or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, noncompliance, or medically refractory epilepsy. Proponents of routine SUDEP counseling argue that patients with epilepsy and their families have a ``right to know'' and that counseling may positively impact epilepsy self-management (i.e., behavioral modification and risk reduction). Some neurologists still believe that SUDEP counseling may cause unnecessary stress and anxiety for patients and their families (although this is erroneous) and that they also have a ``right not to know.'' This narrative review explores the current gaps in SUDEP counseling, patients' and caregivers' perspectives of SUDEP counseling, and SUDEP prevention.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify corticothalamic areas and electrical stimulation paradigms that optimally enhance breathing. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with medically intractable epilepsy were prospectively recruited in an epilepsy monitoring unit while undergoing stereoelectroencephalographic evaluation. Direct electrical stimulation in cortical and thalamic regions was carried out using low (<1 Hz) and high ($\geq$10 Hz) frequencies, and low (<5 mA) and high ($\geq$5 mA) current intensities, with pulse width of .1 ms. Electrocardiography, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2 ), oronasal airflow, and abdominal and thoracic plethysmography were monitored continuously during stimulations. Airflow signal was used to estimate breathing rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation (MV) changes during stimulation, compared to baseline. RESULTS: Electrical stimulation increased MV in the amygdala, anterior cingulate, anterior insula, temporal pole, and thalamus, with an average increase in MV of 20.8\% $\pm$ 28.9\% (range = 0.2\%-165.6\%) in 19 patients. MV changes were associated with SpO2 and ETCO2 changes (p < .001). Effects on respiration were parameter and site dependent. Within amygdala, low-frequency stimulation of the medial region produced 78.49\% greater MV change (p < .001) compared to high-frequency stimulation. Longer stimulation produced greater MV changes (an increase of 4.47\% in MV for every additional 10 s, p = .04). SIGNIFICANCE: Stimulation of amygdala, anterior cingulate gyrus, anterior insula, temporal pole, and thalamus, using certain stimulation paradigms, enhances respiration. Among tested paradigms, low-frequency, low-intensity, long-duration stimulation of the medial amygdala is the most effective breathing enhancement stimulation strategy. Such approaches may pave the way for the future development of neuromodulatory techniques that aid rescue from seizure-related apnea, potentially as a targeted sudden unexpected death in epilepsy prevention method.",

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed deaths among all adults with uncontrolled focal (focal to bilateral tonic-clonic [FBTC], focal impaired awareness, focal aware) or primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures who received $\geq$1 dose of adjunctive cenobamate in completed and ongoing phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. In patients with focal seizures from completed studies, median baseline seizure frequencies ranged from 2.8 to 11 seizures per 28 days and median epilepsy duration ranged from 20 to 24 years. Total person-years included all days a patient received cenobamate during completed studies or up to June 1, 2022 for ongoing studies. All deaths were evaluated by two epileptologists. All-cause mortality and SUDEP rates were expressed per 1000 person-years. RESULTS: A total of 2132 patients (n=2018 focal epilepsy; n=114 idiopathic generalized epilepsy) were exposed to cenobamate for 5693 person-years. Approximately 60\% of patients with focal seizures and all patients in the PGTC study had tonic-clonic seizures. A total of 23 deaths occurred (all in patients with focal epilepsy), for an all-cause mortality rate of 4.0 per 1000 person-years.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The decision to initiate treatment in patients with a first unprovoked seizure remains controversial. Studies have reported a recurrence rate ranging from 21-50\%, but most have included patients with different etiologies, EEG findings, and seizure types. This study aimed to determine the risk of recurrence in patients with a first unprovoked generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure with evidence of generalized spike-wave discharges (GSWD) on EEG and compare the efficacy of antiseizure medications (ASM) in preventing recurrence. METHODS: This prospective study included consecutive patients who presented with a single GTC seizure, evidence of GSWD on EEG, and a follow-up period of at least one year. All patients underwent extensive evaluation, including a 3-hour sleep-deprived video-EEG recording and an epilepsy protocol brain MRI. Treatment with ASM was recommended for all patients. The decision regarding the specific ASM to be used was left to the treating physician's discretion. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients with a median age of 19 years were included. A total of 41 patients agreed to be started on an ASM while 16 declined. Seizure recurred in 6/41 (14.6\%) patients in the treated group compared to 11/16 (68.8\%) in the untreated group (P = 0.00006). Valproate was significantly more efficacious than levetiracetam or lamotrigine (P = 0.04). Of the 15 patients who discontinued ASM treatment after remaining seizure free for an average of 30 months, 6 (40\%) experienced a seizure recurrence. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with a first unprovoked GTC seizure and evidence of GSWD on EEG have a high risk of recurrence if left untreated. Valproate is the most efficacious ASD for preventing recurrence in this population. A sizeable proportion of patients can be successfully tapered off medication after a period of seizure freedom. This study provides valuable information for guiding treatment decisions in this patient population.",

This study aimed to assess the relationships between premonitory symptoms, perceived seizure risk, and future and recent self-reported and EEG-confirmed seizures in ambulatory patients with epilepsy in their natural home environments. METHODS: Long-term e-surveys were collected from patients with and without concurrent EEG recordings. Information obtained from the e-surveys included medication adherence, sleep quality, mood, stress, perceived seizure risk and seizure occurrences preceding the survey. EEG seizures were identified. Univariate and multivariate generalized linear mixed-effect regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the assessment of the relationships. Results were compared with the seizure forecasting classifiers and device forecasting literature using a mathematical formula converting OR to equivalent area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects returned 10,269 e-survey entries, with four subjects acquiring concurrent EEG recordings. Univariate analysis revealed that increased stress (OR = 2.01, 95\% CI = [1.12, 3.61], AUC = 0.61, p = 0.02) was associated with increased relative odds of future self-reported seizures. Multivariate analysis showed that previous self-reported seizures (5.37, [3.53, 8.16], 0.76, < 0.001) were most strongly associated with future self-reported seizures and high perceived seizure risk (3.34, [1.87, 5.95], 0.69, < 0.001) remained significant when prior self-reported seizures were added to the model. No correlation with medical adherence was found. No significant association was found between e-survey responses and subsequent EEG seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that patients may tend to self-forecast seizures that occur in sequential groupings and that low mood and increased stress may be the result of previous seizures rather than independent premonitory symptoms. Patients in the small cohort with concurrent EEG showed no ability to self-predict EEG seizures. The conversion from OR to AUC values facilitates direct comparison of performance between survey and device studies involving survey premonition and forecasting.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Severe respiratory dysfunction induced by generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) is now thought to be a common mechanism for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). In a mouse model of seizure-induced death, increased interictal respiratory variability was reported in mice that later die of respiratory arrest after GCS. We studied respiratory variability in epilepsy patients as a predictive tool for severity of postictal hypoxemia, a potential biomarker for SUDEP risk. We then explored the relationship between respiratory variability and central CO2 drive, measured by the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR). METHODS: We reviewed clinical, video-EEG and respiratory (belts, airflow, pulse oximeter, and HCVR) data of epilepsy patients. Mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of inter-breath-interval (IBI) were calculated. Primary outcomes were: a) nadir of capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and, b) duration of oxygen desaturation. Poincar{\'e} plots of IBI were created. Covariates were evaluated in univariate models, then based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) multivariate regression models were created. RESULTS: Of 66 GCS recorded in 131 subjects 30 had interpretable respiratory data. In the multivariate model with the lowest AIC value, duration of epilepsy was a significant predictor of duration of oxygen desaturation. Duration of tonic phase and CV of IBI during the 3rd minute postictal correlated with SpO2 nadir while CV of IBI during NREM sleep had a negative correlation. Poincar{\'e} plots showed that long-term variability was significantly greater in subjects with > 200 seconds of postictal oxygen desaturation after GCS compared to those with < 200 seconds desaturation. Finally, HCVR slope showed a negative correlation with measures of respiratory variability. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that interictal respiratory variability predicts severity of postictal oxygen desaturation, suggesting its utility as a potential biomarker. They also suggest that interictal respiratory control may be abnormal in some patients with epilepsy.",

Methods We randomly selected 200 patients from the Calgary Comprehensive Epilepsy Program registry and linked their registry-based clinical data to their first-available clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. We excluded patients with a clinical or Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E)-based diagnosis of major depression at baseline. The NDDI-E was used to detect incident depression over a median of 2.4?years follow-up (IQR 1.5-3.3?years). A ReliefF algorithm was applied to clinical as well as quantitative EEG and MRI parameters for feature selection. Six ML algorithms were trained and tested using stratified three-fold cross-validation. Multiple metrics were used to assess model performances. Results Of 200 patients, 150 had EEG and MRI data of sufficient quality for ML, of which 59 were excluded due to prevalent depression. Therefore, 91 patients (41 women) were included with a median age of 29 (IQR 22-44) years. A total of 42 features were selected by ReliefF, none of which were quantitative MRI or EEG variables.

Median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and normalized Matthews correlation coefficient were 0.70 (IQR 0.64-0.78) and 0.57 (IQR 0.50-0.65), respectively. Significance Multimodal machine learning using baseline features can predict incident depression in this population. Our pilot models demonstrated high accuracy for depression prediction. However, overall performance and calibration can be improved. This model has promise for identifying those at risk for incident depression during follow-up, though efforts to refine it in larger populations along with external validation are required.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting approximately 1\% of the population. Mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for several monogenic epilepsy syndromes. More than 800 mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN1A have been reported in patients with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus and Dravet syndrome. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A result in Dravet syndrome, a severe infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by intractable seizures, developmental delays and increased mortality. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variable expressivity among individuals with the same mutation, suggesting that genetic modifiers may influence clinical severity. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a(+/-) ) model a number of Dravet syndrome features, including spontaneous seizures and premature lethality. Phenotype severity in Scn1a(+/-) mice is strongly dependent on strain background. On the 129S6/SvEvTac strain Scn1a(+/-) mice exhibit no overt phenotype, whereas on the (C57BL/6J $\times$ 129S6/SvEvTac)F1 strain Scn1a(+/-) mice exhibit spontaneous seizures and early lethality. To systematically identify loci that influence premature lethality in Scn1a(+/-) mice, we performed genome scans on reciprocal backcrosses. Quantitative trait locus mapping revealed modifier loci on mouse chromosomes 5, 7, 8 and 11. RNA-seq analysis of strain-dependent gene expression, regulation and coding sequence variation provided a list of potential functional candidate genes at each locus. Identification of modifier genes that influence survival in Scn1a(+/-) mice will improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of Dravet syndrome and may suggest novel therapeutic strategies for improved treatment of human patients.",

Eight strains had reproducible, frequent SWDs, including five strains (C57BLKS/J, CBA/J, DBA/1J, NOR/LtJ, SM/J) previously undiagnosed for this distinctive phenotype. Eighteen other strains exhibited no such activity. Spike-wave discharges usually occurred while the subject was motionless, and in a significant number of annotated instances coincided with an arrest of the subject's relatively unrestrained locomotor activity, which resumed immediately after the discharge ended. In all five new strains, SWDs were suppressed by ethosuximide administration. From the genealogy of inbred strains, we suggest that two ancestors, A and DBA, transmitted genotypes required for SWD in all positive strains. Together these strains with SWDs provide new opportunities to understand the genetic core susceptibility of this distinctive electroencephalographic activity and to explore its relationship to absence epilepsy, a human disorder for which few genes are known.",

abstract = "Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene SCN1A are responsible for a number of epilepsy disorders, including genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and Dravet syndrome (DS). In addition, dysfunction in SCN1A is increasingly being linked to neuropsychiatric abnormalities, social deficits, and cognitive disabilities. We have previously reported that mice heterozygous for the SCN1A R1648H mutation identified in a GEFS+ family have infrequent spontaneous seizures, increased susceptibility to chemically- and hyperthermia-induced generalized seizures, and sleep abnormalities. In the present study, we characterized the behavior of heterozygous mice expressing the SCN1A R1648H mutation (Scn1a(RH/+) ) and the effect of stress on spontaneous and induced seizures. We also examined the effect of the R1648H mutation on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response. We confirmed our previous finding that Scn1a(RH/+) mutants are hyperactive, and also identified deficits in social behavior, spatial memory, cued fear conditioning, prepulse inhibition (PPI), and risk assessment. Furthermore, while exposure to a stressor did increase seizure susceptibility, the effect seen in the Scn1a(RH/+) mutants was similar to that seen in wildtype (WT) littermates. In addition, Scn1a dysfunction does not appear to alter HPA axis function in adult animals. Our results suggest that the behavioral abnormalities associated with Scn1a dysfunction encompass a wider range of phenotypes than previously reported and factors such as stress exposure may alter disease severity in patients with SCN1A mutations.",

author = "Venit, Elizabeth L and Shepard, Blythe D and Seyfried, Thomas N",
abstract = "PURPOSE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a significant health problem for some with epilepsy, but no preventive therapy has been developed for high-risk patients. Sudden death in mice, after sound-induced (audiogenic) seizures, can model the seizure-associated respiratory arrest that contributes to SUDEP in some humans and may be useful for evaluating potential SUDEP therapies. This study evaluated the effects of oxygenation on sudden fatal audiogenic seizures (AGSs) in three mouse strains, DBA/2J (D2), B6SAS, and primed C57BL/6J (B6) that differ in genetic background and seizure etiology (idiopathic or acquired). METHODS: The incidence of fatal AGSs was measured in (a) a normal air environment; (b), an oxygen-rich environment; (c) a normal air environment 24 h after a nonfatal AGS; (d) an oxygen-rich environment 24 h after a nonfatal AGS; and (e) a normal air environment 60 s after exposure to an oxygen-rich environment. RESULTS: Sudden, fatal AGS occurred in 100\%, 100\%, and 58\% of the D2, B6SAS, and primed-B6 mice, respectively, in the air environment. Oxygenation completely prevented fatal AGSs in each strain, but had no effect on seizure incidence or severity. Furthermore, the protective effect of oxygenation against fatal seizures occurred only when the mice were in an oxygen-rich environment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that oxygenation prevents sudden death in seizure-prone mice and suggest that oxygenation may protect some seizure-prone humans at risk for SUDEP.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To determine the independent effects of depression and anxiety on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in epilepsy as well as the relative explanatory power of psychiatric comorbidity compared with demographic and clinical epilepsy variables (e.g., seizure frequency, severity, and chronicity). METHODS: Subjects (n = 87) with temporal lobe epilepsy completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, HRQOL, and seizure severity. Information was derived regarding subjects' seizure frequency, duration, and treatment. HRQOL status (QOLIE-89) was examined in relation to self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression, clinical seizure features, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Depression and anxiety were independently associated with reduced HRQOL. Psychiatric comorbidity explained more variance in HRQOL than did combined groups of clinical seizure or demographic variables. Although weaker in explanatory power than psychiatric comorbidity, several epilepsy factors were nonetheless significantly related to HRQOL, including seizure frequency, severity, and chronicity. CONCLUSIONS: Interictal anxiety and depression exert independent adverse effects on HRQOL. In addition, frequent, severe, and chronic seizures reduce HRQOL, but appear less powerful predictors of HRQOL than interictal psychiatric symptoms. Recognition and treatment of comorbid depression and anxiety is an important consideration in improving quality of life in epilepsy.",

author = "Herman, James P and Cullinan, William E and Watson, Stanley J",
abstract = "Abstract The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) occupies a central position in pathways regulating hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) stress regulation. The potential role of the BNST in tonic neural control of HPA function was assessed by examining effects of selective BNST lesions on expression of ACTH secretagogues in HPA-integrative neurons of the medial parvocellular paraventricular nucleus. Anterior BNST lesions (ABN) involved major portions of the anteromedial, anterolateral, ventromedial, ventrolateral, dorsolateral and juxtacapsular subnuclei. These lesions resulted in significant (30\%) decreases in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA expression across the rostrocaudal extent of the medial parvocellular PVN, with no accompanying changes in basal arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNA levels. Posterior BNST (PBN) lesions involved large but subtotal damage to the posterior intermediate, posterior medial, posterior lateral and preoptic subnuclei; these lesions resulted in small but significant changes in CRH mRNA and slight increases in number of AVP mRNA-producing parvocellular neurons. PBN effects on CRH mRNA expression were most pronounced at the caudal extent of the medial parvocellular zone, suggesting a topographic input from the posterior BNST to the PVN that is only partially compromised by PBN lesions. Analysis of individual cases revealed a correlation between damage of the anterolateral BNST and decreased CRH mRNA levels, and damage of the posterior intermediate and/or posterior medial BNST and increased CRH mRNA levels. The results suggest differential BNST input into HPA regulation, perhaps reflecting the diversity of limbic input into the BNST region.",

title = "Role of the central nucleus of the amygdala in the control of blood pressure: descending pathways to medullary cardiovascular nuclei",
author = "Saha, S",
abstract = "1. One of the key areas that links psychologically induced stress with the blood pressure-regulatory system is the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). This is an integratory forebrain nucleus that receives input from higher centres in the forebrain and has extensive connections with the hypothalamus and the medulla oblongata, areas involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular reflexes. 2. Based on studies using electrical or chemical stimulation or electrolytic lesions of the CeA, it has become clear that the CeA plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure in response to stressful or fearful stimuli. 3. Two important medullary areas known to receive projections from the CeA are the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The NTS is the site of the first synapse for afferent fibres originating from baroreceptors, chemoreceptors and the heart, whereas the RVLM contains neurons that maintain resting blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity via projections to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral cell column of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. 4. Electron microscopic studies using combined anterograde tracing and pre- and post-embedding immunogold labelling have shown that the pathways originating from the CeA to the NTS are inhibitory and may use GABA as a neurotransmitter. The results of these studies suggest that blood pressure changes produced by activation of the CeA may be mediated by attenuation of baroreceptor reflexes through a GABAergic mechanism at the level of the NTS. 5. Neuronal tract tracing combined with neurofunctional studies using the Fos protein as a marker of activated neurons indicate that the CeA projects directly to baroreceptive neurons in the NTS and RVLM that are activated by changes in blood pressure. 6. In conclusion, studies that have examined the efferent pathways of the CeA suggest that CeA neurons with projections to medullary baroreceptive neurons may play a vital role in the reflex changes in sympathetic nerve activity that are involved in blood pressure regulation in response to stress or anxiety.",

Intrinsically burst firing subicular neurons are involved in the generation and spread of epileptic activity. We measured whole-cell sodium currents in pyramidal neurons isolated from the subiculum resected in drug-resistant epileptic patients and in rats. In half of the cells from both patients and rats, the sodium current inactivated within 500 ms at -30 mV. Others displayed a tetrodotoxin-sensitive slowly or non-inactivating sodium current of up to 53\% of the total sodium current amplitude. Compared with the transient sodium current in the same cells, this persistent sodium current activated with normal kinetics but its voltage-dependent activation occurred 7 mV more hyperpolarized. Depolarizing voltage steps that lasted 10 s completely inactivated the persistent sodium current. Its voltage dependence did not differ from that of the transient sodium current but its slope was less steep. The voltage dependence and kinetics of the persistent sodium current in cells from patients were not different from that in subicular cells from rats. The current density and the relative amplitude contribution were 3-4 times greater in neurons from drug-resistant epilepsy patients. The abundant presence of persistent sodium current in half of the subicular neurons could lead to a larger number of neurons with intrinsic burst firing. The extraordinarily large amplitude of the persistent sodium current in this subset of subicular neurons might explain why these patients are susceptible to seizures and hard to treat pharmacologically.",

To determine whether newborn and/or mature dentate granule neurons have altered neurotransmitter receptor expression after SE, we dissected individual immature, PSA-NCAM-expressing, or mature, NeuN-expressing, dentate granule neurons 2 weeks after lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE in postnatal day 20 rats. Amplified single-cell RNA was used to probe reverse Northern blots containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate neurotransmitter receptor subunits. Two weeks after lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE there were increases in AMPA GluR2 and kainate KA2 subunit mRNA and decreases in AMPA GluR3 and kainate GluR6 receptor subunit mRNA levels in mature dentate granule neurons. In contrast, only the kainate GluR6 subunit expression was reduced in immature dentate granule neurons after SE. Alterations in transcription of excitatory amino acid receptor subunits after SE occur primarily in the mature population of dentate granule neurons. Our findings suggest that neurotransmitter receptor gene expression is altered differently in immature and mature dentate granule neurons following SE, and may result in differential contributions of these two groups of dentate granule neurons to the subsequent development of epilepsy.",

author = "Dutschmann, Mathias and Herbert, Horst",
abstract = "Lesion or pharmacological manipulation of the dorsolateral pons can transform the breathing pattern to apneusis (pathological prolonged inspiration). Apneusis reflects a disturbed inspiratory off-switch mechanism (IOS) leading to a delayed phase transition from inspiration to expiration. Under intact conditions the IOS is irreversibly mediated via activation of postinspiratory (PI) neurons within the respiratory network. In parallel, populations of laryngeal premotoneurons manifest the IOS by a brief glottal constriction during the PI phase. We investigated effects of pontine excitation (glutamate injection) or temporary lesion after injection of a GABA-receptor agonist (isoguvacine) on the strength of PI-pool activity determined from respiratory motor outputs or kinesiological measurements of laryngeal resistance in a perfused brainstem preparation. Glutamate microinjections into distinct parts of the pontine K{\"o}lliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) evoked a tonic excitation of PI-motor activity or sustained laryngeal constriction accompanied by prolongation of the expiratory phase. Subsequent isoguvacine microinjections at the same loci abolished PI-motor or laryngeal constrictor activity, triggered apneusis and established a variable and decreased breathing frequency. In summary, we revealed that excitation or inhibition of defined areas within the KF activated and blocked PI activity and, consequently, IOS. Therefore, we conclude, first, that descending KF inputs are essential to gate PI activity required for a proper pattern formation and phase control within the respiratory network, at least during absence of pulmonary stretch receptor activity and, secondly, that the KF contains large numbers of laryngeal PI premotor neurons that might have a key role in the regulation of upper airway resistance during reflex control and vocalization.",

In the present study we have evaluated the electrophysiological alterations in the ventral commissural hippocampal system that originates in the pyramidal CA3 cells and connects to the contralateral CA3 pyramidal cells. The recordings were performed in epileptic rats 24 h after an early behavioural spontaneous seizure between 5 and 21 days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Epileptic animals presented a marked increase in neuronal excitability after contralateral CA3 stimulation, characterized by a shift to the left in the input-output curve and the clear appearance of a population spike. Input-output curves showed that maximum population excitatory postsynaptic potential (pEPSP) amplitude was decreased by 30\%, which could be related to cell death in these regions. Using paired-pulse protocols to evaluate a fast form of synaptic plasticity (i.e. paired-pulse facilitation) we observed that, despite the similar pEPSP amplitude between control and experimental groups, only epileptic animals showed strong paired-pulse population spike facilitation up to 500 ms interstimulus intervals. Despite increased excitability and pyramidal cell death, epileptic animals presented a more robust potentiation after high-frequency stimulation than controls, a protocol used to evaluate a slow form of synaptic plasticity (i.e. long-term potentiation). The increased excitability in CA3 pyramidal neurons enhanced the probability of burst activity in these neurons; this could lead to greater CA1 synchronization. The present results might have relevance for the understanding of epileptogenesis and of learning and memory deficits seen in temporal lobe epilepsy.",

However, the role of increased neurogenesis in these areas in seizure generation (ictogenesis) and epileptogenesis remains elusive. It is of utmost importance to explore how the cells that are born in response to epileptic seizures are functionally integrated into the existing neuronal networks, and how this integration would contribute to the excitability of this network. This will determine whether increased neurogenesis is beneficial or counteractive to ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. Some of the crucial factors affecting the functional integration of newborn cells seem to be excessive neuronal activity and/or inflammatory microenvironment, both associated with acute, as well as chronic, epileptic conditions. This review will focus on aspects of the functional integration of newborn cells in animal models of epilepsy with various degrees of seizure severity and associated microenvironmental alterations in the brain tissue.",

abstract = "In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that serotonergic neurotransmission modulates a wide variety of experimentally induced seizures. Generally, agents that elevate extracellular serotonin (5-HT) levels, such as 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin reuptake blockers, inhibit both focal and generalized seizures, although exceptions have been described, too. Conversely, depletion of brain 5-HT lowers the threshold to audiogenically, chemically and electrically evoked convulsions. Furthermore, it has been shown that several anti-epileptic drugs increase endogenous extracellular 5-HT concentration. 5-HT receptors are expressed in almost all networks involved in epilepsies. Currently, the role of at least 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2C), 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(7) receptor subtypes in epileptogenesis and/or propagation has been described. Mutant mice lacking 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(2C) receptors show increased seizure activity and/or lower threshold. In general, hyperpolarization of glutamatergic neurons by 5-HT(1A) receptors and depolarization of GABAergic neurons by 5-HT(2C) receptors as well as antagonists of 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(7) receptors decrease the excitability in most, but not all, networks involved in epilepsies. Imaging data and analysis of resected tissue of epileptic patients, and studies in animal models all provide evidence that endogenous 5-HT, the activity of its receptors, and pharmaceuticals with serotonin agonist and/or antagonist properties play a significant role in the pathogenesis of epilepsies.",

abstract = "The association of temporal lobe epilepsy with depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders has been known since the early beginnings of neurology and psychiatry. However, only recently have in vivo and ex vivo techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in combination with refined animal models and behavioral tests made it possible to identify an emerging pattern of common pathophysiological mechanisms. We now have growing evidence that in both disorders altered interaction of serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons with glutamatergic systems is associated with abnormal neuronal circuits and hyperexcitability. Neuronal hyperexcitability can possibly evoke seizure activity as well as disturbed emotions. Moreover, decreased synaptic levels of neurotransmitters and high glucocorticoid levels influence intracellular signaling pathways such as cAMP, causing disturbances of brain-derived and other neurotrophic factors. These may be associated with hippocampal atrophy seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging and memory impairment as well as altered fear processing and transient hypertrophy of the amygdala. Positron Emission Tomography studies additionally suggest hypometabolism of glucose in temporal and frontal lobes. Last, but not least, in temporal lobe epilepsy and depression astrocytes play a role that reaches far beyond their involvement in hippocampal sclerosis and ultimately, therapeutic regulation of glial-neuronal interactions may be a target for future research. All these mechanisms are strongly intertwined and probably bidirectional such that the structural and functional alterations from one disease increase the risk for developing the other.

abstract = "To define further the electroclinical manifestations of frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), we studied 150 seizures manifested by 24 patients; 18 patients had subdural electrode arrays (SEA). The findings in these patients clearly overlapped presumably reflecting the interconnections between functionally related frontal zones; yet the manner in which the symptoms clustered and the sequence in which they occurred generally indicated the anatomic site of the epileptogenic zone. We divided the patients into three major groups: (a) those with supplementary motor seizures, (b) those with focal motor seizures, and (c) those with complex partial seizures (CPS, psychomotor seizures). Supplementary motor seizures began with tonic posturing of the extremities. Focal motor seizures generally began with conscious contralateral version or unilateral clonic focal motor activity; tonic posturing was noted only late in the seizure. CPS (psychomotor) began with unresponsiveness at onset, followed by staring or unconscious contraversion. We compared frontal lobe seizures with temporal lobe seizures reported previously; oral-alimentary automatisms, repetitive hand movements, or looking around, were more common in temporal lobe seizures, whereas tonic posturing and bicycling movements were more common in frontal lobe psychomotor seizures.",

METHODS: Twenty-six children with intractable partial and generalized epilepsy exercised during video-telemetry recording, aiming at exhaustion after approximately 10 min. RESULTS: During the exercise, epileptiform discharges decreased in 20 of 26 children (17 children had at least 25\% reduction) and showed a rebound increase after the exercise (17 of 26 children) compared to baseline conditions. This exercise-induced reduction in epileptiform discharges reached statistical significance only in the 16 patients with localization-related epilepsy. Five patients showed an atypical EEG response to exercise with either unchanged or increased epileptiform activity while exercising. As compared to the other patients, these 5 children had experienced frequent clinical seizures during or immediately after exercise in their leisure time. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of the tested children, epileptiform EEG discharges decreased during exercise. ``Exercise-EEG'' may be a helpful diagnostic tool to identify patients who are disposed to have exercise-induced seizures.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: The occurrence of hypoxemia in adults with partial seizures has not been systematically explored. Our aim was to study in detail the temporal dynamics of this specific type of ictal-associated hypoxemia. METHODS: During long-term video/EEG monitoring (LTM), patients underwent monitoring of oxygen saturation using a digital Spo2 (pulse oximeter) transducer. Six patients (nine seizures) were identified with oxygen desaturations after the onset of partial seizure activity. RESULTS: Complex partial seizures originated from both left and right temporal lobes. Mean seizure duration (+/-SD) was 73 +/- 18 s. Mean Spo2 desaturation duration was 76 +/- 19 s. The onset of oxygen desaturation followed seizure onset with a mean delay of 43 +/- 16 s. Mean (+/-SD) Spo2 nadir was 83 +/- 5\% (range, 77-91\%), occurring an average of 35 +/- 12 s after the onset of the desaturation. One seizure was associated with prolonged and recurrent Spo2 desaturations. CONCLUSIONS: Partial seizures may be associated with prominent oxygen desaturations. The comparable duration of each seizure and its subsequent desaturation suggests a close mechanistic (possibly causal) relation. Spo2 monitoring provides an added means for seizure detection that may increase LTM yield. These observations also raise the possibility that ictal ventilatory dysfunction could play a role in certain cases of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy in adults with partial seizures.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: Hilar mossy cells represent an important excitatory subpopulation of the hippocampal formation. Several studies have identified this cell type as particularly vulnerable to seizure activity in rat models of limbic epilepsy. Here we have subjected hilar mossy cell loss in the hippocampus of patients with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to a systematic morphological and immunohistochemical analysis. METHODS: Hippocampal specimens from 30 TLE patients were included; 21 patients presented with segmental neuronal cell loss [Ammon's horns clerosis (AHS)] and 8 with focal lesions (tumors, scars, malformations) not involving the hippocampus proper. In one additional TLE patient, no histopathological alteration could be observed. Surgical specimens from tumor patients without epilepsy (n = 2) and nonepileptic autopsy brains (n = 8) were used as controls. Hilar mossy cells in the human hippocampus were visualized using a novel polycloncal antiserum directed against the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR7b or by intracellular Lucifer Yellow injection, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and three-dimensional morphological reconstruction. RESULTS: Compared with controls, a significant loss of mGluR7 immunoreactive mossy cells was observed in patients with AHS (p < 0.05). In contrast, TLE patients with focal lesions but structurally intact hippocampus demonstrated only a discrete, nonsignificant reduction of this neuronal subpopulation. This observation was confirmed by analysis of 62 randomly injected hilar neurons from AHS patients, in which we were unable to detect neurons with a morphology like that of hilar mossy cells. CONCLUSION: Our present data indicate significant hilar mossy cell loss in TLE patients with AHS. In contrast, hilar mossy cells appear to be less vulnerable in patients with lesion-associated TLE. Although the significance of mGluR7 immunoreactivity in mossy cells remains to be studied, loss of this cell population is compatible with alterations in hippocampal networks and regional hyperexcitability as pathogenic mechanism of AHS and TLE.",

However, in the past decade, there has been increasing recognition of families with dominantly inherited partial epilepsies. Better definition of the phenotypes allows identification of distinct syndromes. The main familial focal epilepsies are autosomal-dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), familial mesial TLE (FMTLE), familial lateral TLE (FLTLE), and familial partial epilepsy with variable foci (FPEVF). The only genes identified so far are those for ADNFLE and FLTLE. In these disorders, functional studies are the next step and could provide advances leading to clarification of the pathophysiology as well as to new therapeutic strategies. At present, we can provide genetic counseling and a more accurate prognosis for most of the familial focal epilepsies. Greater awareness of the genetic basis in this group of disorders by the treating physicians is essential for identification of new families. This will allow further linkage studies, candidate gene screening, and identification of new genes, which will hopefully result in genetically based prevention and treatment.",

abstract = "Summary: Central nervous system synapses have an intrinsic plastic capacity to adapt to new conditions with rapid changes in their structure. Such activity-dependent refinement occurs during development and learning, and shares features with diseases such as epilepsy. Quantitative ultrastructural studies based on serial sectioning and reconstructions have shown various structural changes associated with synaptic strength involving both dendritic spines and postsynaptic densities (PSDs) during long-term potentiation (LTP). In this review, we focus on experimental studies that have analyzed at the ultrastructural level the consequences of LTP in rodents, and plastic changes in the hippocampus of experimental models of epilepsy and human tissue obtained during surgeries for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Modifications in spine morphology, increases in the proportion of synapses with perforated PSDs, and formation of multiple spine boutons arising from the same dendrite are the possible sequence of events that accompany hippocampal LTP. Structural remodeling of mossy fiber synapses and formation of aberrant synaptic contacts in the dentate gyrus are common features in experimental models of epilepsy and in human TLE. Combined electrophysiological and ultrastructural studies in kindled rats and chronic epileptic animals have indicated the occurrence of seizure- and neuron loss-induced changes in the hippocampal network. In these experiments, the synaptic contacts on granule cells are similar to those described for LTP. Such changes could be associated with enhancement of synaptic efficiency and may be important in epileptogenesis.",

We determined alterations of synaptic and intrinsic properties of subicular pyramidal cells that accompany spontaneous rhythmic activity in human sclerotic and nonsclerotic epileptic tissue. RESULTS: We found that in sclerotic, but also in nonsclerotic hippocampal tissue, the subiculum showed cellular and synaptic changes that were associated with spontaneous rhythmic activity correlated to the occurrence and frequency of interictal discharges recorded in the electroencephalograms of the corresponding patients. CONCLUSIONS: Even though Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS) in resected hippocampi from patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy has important prognostic implications for freedom from seizures postoperatively, we report here that both synaptic and intrinsic alterations enhance seizure susceptibility of the subiculum also in the absence of classical AHS.",

author = "Tupal, Srinivasan and Faingold, Carl L",
abstract = "PURPOSE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a serious concern for epilepsy patients. DBA/2 mice are proposed as a SUDEP model, because these mice exhibit respiratory arrest (RA) after audiogenic seizures (AGSs), and RA is also implicated in human SUDEP. Respiratory mechanisms are modulated, in part, by serotonin. Therefore we evaluated the effects of serotoninergic agents on RA incidence in DBA/2 mice. METHODS: DBA/2 mice (75\%) exhibited AGS and RA, and approximately 99\% of animals could be resuscitated. The mice exhibiting RA were given a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, 24 h after the initial AGS, and RA susceptibility was evaluated 30 min later. Ten percent of DBA/2 mice exhibited tonic hindlimb extension (TE) without RA, and a serotonin antagonist (cyproheptadine) was administered to these mice. RESULTS: Fluoxetine (15-25 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the incidence of RA in DBA/2 mice after AGSs, and this effect was reversible by 72 h. Only the 25-mg/kg dose reduced AGS severity. In mice exhibiting TE without RA, the incidence of RA was significantly increased 30 min after cyproheptadine (1-2 mg/kg i.p.). Most of these mice exhibited AGSs without RA again by 72 h. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that fluoxetine reduced RA in DBA/2 mice at doses that did not reduce seizure severity. Because DBA/2 mice are a proposed model for human SUDEP, these data support evaluation of fluoxetine for SUDEP prevention in the patient population most susceptible to SUDEP. The data raise concern about the use of serotonin antagonists in this patient population.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: We performed this study to determine whether significant head trauma in human adults can result in hippocampal cell loss, particularly in hilar (polymorph) and CA3 neurons, similar to that observed in animal models of traumatic brain injury. We examined the incidence of hippocampal pathology and its relation to temporal neocortical pathology, neuronal reorganization, and other variables. METHODS: Twenty-one of 200 sequential temporal lobectomies had only trauma as a risk factor for epilepsy. Tissue specimens from temporal neocortex and hippocampus were stained with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E). Eleven hippocampal specimens had additional analysis of neuronal distributions by using cresyl violet and immunolabeling of a neuron-specific nuclear protein. RESULTS: The median age at onset of trauma was 19 years, the median time between trauma and onset of seizures was 2 years, and the median epilepsy duration was 16 years. The length of the latent period was inversely related to the age at the time of trauma (r=0.75; Spearman). The neocortex showed gliosis in all specimens, with hemosiderosis (n=8) or heterotopias (n=6) in some, a distribution differing from chance (p=0.02; Fisher). Hippocampal neuronal loss was found in 94\% of specimens, and all of these had cell loss in the polymorph (hilar) region of the dentate gyrus. Hilar cell loss ranged from mild, when cell loss was confined to the hilus, to severe, when cell loss extended into CA3 and CA1. Some degree of mossy fiber sprouting was found in the dentate gyrus of all 10 specimens in which it was evaluated. Granule cell dispersion (n=4) was seen only in specimens with moderate to severe neuronal loss. CONCLUSIONS: Neocortical pathology was universally present after trauma. Neuronal loss in the hilar region was the most consistent finding in the hippocampal formation, similar to that found in the fluid-percussion model of traumatic head injury. These findings support the idea that head trauma can induce hippocampal epilepsy in humans in the absence of other known risk factors.",

It remains a mainstay of epilepsy related research, but the question remains how the results from kindling experiments further our understanding of the underlying neurobiology of human epilepsy. In this article we compare the basic features of kindling and human epilepsy, especially human limbic or temporal lobe epilepsy. In this review we focus on a limited number of topics that may show areas in which kindling has been often cited as a tool for better understanding of human epilepsy. These areas include the underlying circuits, the importance of seizure spontaneity, the associated neuropathology, the contribution of genetics, seizure susceptibility, and the underlying pathophysiology of epilepsy. In the course of this article we will show that there are many features that kindling can teach us by direct comparison or implication about human temporal epilepsy. We will also see that not all findings associated with kindling may be applicable to the human condition. Ultimately we wish to encourage critical thinking about kindling and the similarities that it shares and does not share with the human epilepsy so the results from studies using this model are applied rationally to further our insights the mechanisms of human epilepsy.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To examine postictal breathing pattern in generalized convulsive nonepileptic seizures (GCNES) and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and evaluate this feature as a discriminating sign. METHODS: We reviewed the postictal breathing pattern seizures in 23 generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 15 consecutive patients with epilepsy and 24 convulsive nonepileptic seizures in 16 consecutive patients with pure psychogenic seizures. We also analyzed 21 frontal lobe hypermotor seizures (FLHS) in 9 patients with frontal lobe epilepsy. RESULTS: The breathing after GTCS was deep with prolonged inspiratory and expiratory phases, regular, and loud (except for two short seizures). The breathing after GCNES was characterized by increased respiratory rate or hyperpnea with short inspiratory and expiratory phases, as can be noted after exercise. The breathing was often irregular, with brief pauses. The altered breathing lasted longer after GTCS. The two groups differed significantly in loudness of postictal respiration, postictal snoring (only with GTCS), respiratory rate (faster for the GCNES group), and duration of altered breathing (longer after GTCS) (p < 0.00001 for all features). FLHS shared postictal breathing features of GCNES, but had other distinguishing features. CONCLUSIONS: The postictal breathing pattern can help differentiate generalized tonic-clonic seizures from nonepileptic psychogenic seizures with generalized motor activity and may be helpful to the practitioner obtaining a seizure history in the clinic setting or witnessing a seizure.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To determine whether hippocampal sclerosis might form an anatomical substrate for pathological high-frequency oscillations in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). METHODS: Intracerebral wide bandwidth electroencephalogram was recorded in patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures. A computer-automated program detected interictal normal ripples (80-150 Hz) and pathologic fast ripples (FR, 151-500 Hz) from microelectrodes within hippocampus, entorhinal, and subicular cortices. Hippocampal MRI volumetric analysis and cell density measurements were correlated with rates of FR and ripple discharge. RESULTS: In all 13 patients, higher rates of FR (p = 0.03) and ratios of FR to ripple discharges (p = 0.02) were observed in sites ipsilateral to seizure onset compared with rates within contralateral non-ictal sites. Higher ratios of FR to ripple discharge were associated with smaller ipsilateral hippocampal volumes (p = 0.02) and lower fascia dentata (FD; p = 0.02) and Ammon's horn (p = 0.0005) neuron densities. While reduced FD and Ammon's horn neuron densities correlated with higher ratios of discharges, stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that decreased neuron densities within CA1 and prosubiculum regions most strongly predicted ratios of FR to ripples (r(2)= 0.78, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In surgical patients with TLE, higher ratios of FR to ripple discharges are associated with histopathologic changes found in hippocampal sclerosis. These findings support the hypothesis that pathological alterations linked with hippocampal cell loss and synaptic reorganization promote FR and reduce ripple generation.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: Optical recording of intrinsic signals provides the highest combined spatial and temporal resolution with broad spatial sampling for measuring cerebral blood volume (CBV) and hemoglobin oxygenation in cerebral cortex. Few opportunities arise to apply this laboratory method to record spontaneous seizures in unanesthetized human brain during neurosurgery. We report such a rare opportunity in a man with recurrent focal epilepsy arising from a cavernous malformation. METHODS: We recorded intrinsic optical signals (IOS) from human cortex intraoperatively during spontaneous seizures arising from brain surrounding a small cavernous malformation in an awake patient using only local anesthesia with simultaneous electrocorticography. The IOS was recorded at two wavelengths, one an isosbestic point for hemoglobin to measure CBV (570 nm) and the other at a wavelength more sensitive to deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hbr) (610 nm). A modified Beer-Lambert calculation was used on two separate but similar seizures to approximate changes in Hbr, CBV as well as oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO(2)). RESULTS: Electrographically recorded seizures (n = 3) elicited a focal increase in both Hbr and CBV that lasted for the duration of the seizure, indicating that perfusion was inadequate to meet metabolic demand. Remarkably, these hemodynamic changes preceded the onset of the seizures by approximately 20 s and occurred focally over the known location of the lesion and the seizure onsets. DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that the hemoglobin becomes deoxygenated in spite of large increase in CBV during spontaneous human focal seizures and that optically recorded hemodynamic events can be used both to predict and localize human focal epilepsy. Such data may someday be useful to assist in the presurgical evaluation of patients considered for epilepsy surgery and to predict the timing and location of seizure onsets.",

abstract = "Purpose: Early life stress has enduring behavioral and neuroendocrine effects, particularly in hippocampus and amygdala. This may be relevant to mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) that arises from these structures. In rats, we tested the hypothesis that early postnatal stress, in the form of maternal separation (MS), creates vulnerability to limbic epileptogenesis in adult life. Methods: On postnatal days 2--14, we exposed male and female nonepileptic rats to either MS for 180 min/day, or early handling (EH) and brief separation (15 min/day). At 7 weeks of age, rats of both genders exposed to MS displayed significantly increased anxiety, as evidenced by reduced time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze compared with EH rats. For epileptogenesis experiments, separate cohorts of rats, similarly exposed to either early life MS or EH, were implanted with bipolar electrodes into the left amygdala and one week later rapid electrical kindling performed until fully kindled (five Class V seizures, Racine scale). Results: In females, fewer stimulations were required following MS than EH to reach the fully kindled state (39.6 $\pm$ 6.4 vs. 67.1 $\pm$ 9.4; p < 0.0001); no differences were observed in males (MS: 49.1 $\pm$ 5.1; EH: 53.7 $\pm$ 6.6 stimulations). Discussion: We conclude that, while postnatal MS stress increases anxiety in both genders, this early life stressor results in persisting vulnerability to limbic epileptogenesis only in females. This has implications for human MTLE and its psychiatric comorbidities, suggesting a common causation model and the involvement of gender-specific factors such as sex hormones.",

Qualitative and quantitative analysis of peri, post and interictal diffusion images can aid the localization of seizure foci. Diffusion tensor tractography is an extension of diffusion-based imaging, and can provide additional information about white matter pathways. Both techniques are able to increase understanding of the effects of epilepsy on the structural organization of the brain, and can be used to optimize presurgical planning of patients with epilepsy. This review focuses on the basis, applications, limitations, and future directions of diffusion imaging in epilepsy. Literature search strategy: We searched Pubmed using the terms ``diffusion MRI or diffusion tensor MRI or tractography and epilepsy.''",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical and hippocampal histological features of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) in both familial (FMTLE) and sporadic (SMTLE) forms. METHODS: Patients with FMTLE (n = 20) and SMTLE (n = 39) who underwent surgical treatment for refractory seizures were studied at the University of S{\~a}o Paulo School of Medicine at Ribeir{\~a}o Preto. FMTLE was defined when at least two individuals in a family had clinical diagnosis of MTLE. Hippocampi from all patients were processed for Nissl/HE and Timm's stainings. Both groups were compared for clinical variables, hippocampal cell densities, and intensity of supragranular mossy fiber staining. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between FMTLE and SMTLE groups in the following: age at the surgery, age of first usual epileptic seizure, history of initial precipitating injury (IPI), age of IPI, latent period, ictal and interictal video-EEG patterns, presence of hippocampal atrophy and signal changes at MRI, and postoperative outcome. In addition, no differences were found in cell densities in hippocampal cornu ammonis subfields (CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4), fascia dentata, polymorphic region, subiculum, prosubiculum, and presubiculum. However, patients with SMTLE had greater intensity of mossy fiber Timm's staining in the fascia dentata-inner molecular layer (p< 0.05). DISCUSSION: Patients with intractable FMTLE present a clinical profile and most histological findings comparable to patients with SMTLE. Interestingly, mossy fiber sprouting was less pronounced in patients with FMTLE, suggesting that, when compared to SMTLE, patients with FMTLE respond differently to plastic changes plausibly induced by cell loss, neuronal deafferentation, or epileptic seizures.",

abstract = "Purpose: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) known as ripples (80--250 Hz) and fast ripples (250--500 Hz) can be recorded from macroelectrodes inserted in patients with intractable focal epilepsy. They are most likely linked to epileptogenesis and have been found in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) of human ictal and interictal recordings. HFOs occur frequently at the time of interictal spikes, but were also found independently. This study analyses the relationship between spikes and HFOs and the occurrence of HFOs in nonspiking channels. Methods: Intracerebral EEGs of 10 patients with intractable focal epilepsy were studied using macroelectrodes. Rates of HFOs within and outside spikes, the overlap between events, event durations, and the percentage of spikes carrying HFOs were calculated and compared according to anatomical localization, spiking activity, and relationship to the SOZ. Results: HFOs were found in all patients, significantly more within mesial temporal lobe structures than in neocortex. HFOs could be seen in spiking as well as nonspiking channels in all structures. Rates and durations of HFOs were significantly higher in the SOZ than outside. It was possible to establish a rate of HFOs to identify the SOZ with better sensitivity and specificity than with the rate of spikes. Discussion: HFOs occurred to a large extent independently of spikes. They are most frequent in mesial temporal structures. They are prominent in the SOZ and provide additional information on epileptogenicity independently of spikes. It was possible to identify the SOZ with a high specificity by looking at only 10 min of HFO activity.",

This cross-sectional study examined behavioral/emotional, cognitive, and linguistic comorbidities as well as their correlates in children with CAE. METHODS: Sixty-nine CAE children aged 9.6 (SD = 2.49) years and 103 age- and gender-matched normal children had semistructured psychiatric interviews, as well as cognitive and linguistic testing. Parents provided demographic, seizure-related, and behavioral information on their children through a semi-structured psychiatric interview and the child behavior checklist (CBCL). RESULTS: Compared to the normal group, 25\% of the CAE children had subtle cognitive deficits, 43\% linguistic difficulties, 61\% a psychiatric diagnosis, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders, and 30\% clinically relevant CBCL broad band scores. The most frequent CBCL narrow band factor scores in the clinical/borderline range were attention and somatic complaints, followed by social and thought problems. Duration of illness, seizure frequency, and antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment were related to the severity of the cognitive, linguistic, and psychiatric comorbidities. Only 23\% of the CAE subjects had intervention for these problems. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of impaired behavior, emotions, cognition, and language and low intervention rate should alert clinicians to the need for early identification and treatment of children with CAE, particularly those with longer duration of illness, uncontrolled seizures, and AED treatment.",

title = "Stress, the hippocampus, and epilepsy",
author = "Jo{\"e}ls, Marian",
abstract = "Stress is among the most frequently self-reported precipitants of seizures in patients with epilepsy. This review considers how important stress mediators like corticotropin-releasing hormone, corticosteroids, and neurosteroids could contribute to this phenomenon. Cellular effects of stress mediators in the rodent hippocampus are highlighted. Overall, corticosterone---with other stress hormones---rapidly enhances CA1/CA3 hippocampal activity shortly after stress. At the same time, corticosterone starts gene-mediated events, which enhance calcium influx several hours later. This later effect serves to normalize activity but also imposes a risk for neuronal injury if and when neurons are concurrently strongly depolarized, for example, during epileptic activity. In the dentate gyrus, stress-induced elevations in corticosteroid level are less effective in changing membrane properties such as calcium influx; here, enhanced inhibitory tone mediated through neurosteroid effects on $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors might dominate. Under conditions of repetitive stress (e.g., caused from experiencing repetitive and unpredictable seizures) and/or early life stress, hormonal influences on the inhibitory tone, however, are diminished; instead, enhanced calcium influx and increased excitation become more important. In agreement, perinatal stress and elevated steroid levels accelerate epileptogenesis and lower seizure threshold in various animal models for epilepsy. It will be interesting to examine how curtailing the effects of stress in adults, for example, by brief treatment with antiglucocorticoids, may be beneficial to the treatment of epilepsy.",

author = "Sloviter, Robert S",
abstract = "Prolonged chemoconvulsant-induced status epilepticus in rats has long been promoted as an animal model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, under the assumption that these animals involve: (1) pathology similar to that of the human neurologic condition; (2) a seizure-free, ``preepileptic'' latent period of several weeks duration after injury, during which a secondary epileptogenic process gradually develops; and (3) a chronic epileptic state in which the hippocampus, in general, and the dentate gyrus, in particular, becomes a source of the spontaneous behavioral seizures that define these animals as ``epileptic.'' Retrospective analysis suggests that all of these assumptions are in doubt. Neuropathologic studies have shown that prolonged status epilepticus causes greater extrahippocampal than hippocampal damage, and does not produce classic hippocampal sclerosis. In vivo electrophysiologic studies suggest that the hippocampus of these animals may not be ``epileptic.'' Most importantly, studies using continuous video monitoring to detect spontaneous behavioral seizures indicate that these rats become epileptic soon after insult, before any delayed secondary processes have time to develop. High mortality, significant variability, and the lack of an extended ``therapeutic window'' after brain injury suggest the need to develop animal models that more closely resemble the human neurologic condition.",

Studies of VNS in children report mainly seizure frequency reduction as a measure of efficacy and clinical details are often scanty. We report our experience with VNS in children with refractory epilepsy and emphasize the positive effects of VNS in terms of seizure severity. METHODS: We reviewed 26 consecutive children who had VNS with a minimum follow-up period of 18 months. We examined their clinical characteristics, seizure types, seizure frequency, epilepsy syndrome diagnosis, and response to VNS in terms of seizure frequency and seizure severity. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of patients responded to VNS with >or=50\% seizure frequency reduction. Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and tonic seizures had a higher responder rate; 78\% (seven of nine patients) (p < 0.01). Status epilepticus (SE) episodes were reduced or ceased in the four patients with recurrent SE. Seizure severity, duration, and recovery time decreased in all responders. Increased alertness was reported in all responders and three nonresponders. CONCLUSION: Decreased seizure severity, recovery time, abolition of daytime drop attacks, and reduced hospitalization due to SE improved patients' lives over and above the benefit from seizure frequency reduction.",

author = "M{\"o}ddel, Gabriel and Lineweaver, Tara and Schuele, Stephan U and Reinholz, Julia and Loddenkemper, Tobias",
abstract = "PURPOSE: To investigate whether atypical language dominance in epilepsy patients is related to localization and type of lesions. METHODS: Four hundred and forty-five epilepsy patients received bilateral Wada testing. Language was classified as left (L), right (R), bilateral-dependent (BD, speech arrest after left and right injections), or bilateral-independent (BI, no speech arrest after either injection). Groups were compared regarding handedness and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions. Lesions were classified as ``early'' (congenital), ``late'' neocortical (acquired after birth), and hippocampal sclerosis (HS). RESULTS: Of all patients, 78\% were L, 6\% R, 7\% BD, and 9\% BI. Right-handers with left lesions did not differ from those without lesions. Left-handers with normal MRI did not differ from right-handers. Left-handers with early left lesions were most likely R (46\%). Left-handers with late neocortical left lesions were most likely BD (37\%); those with left HS were most likely BD (33\%) or L (33\%). In both latter groups, R language was rare (13\% and 11\%, respectively). DISCUSSION: The data support the notion that R dominance may indicate development of functional language areas in the right hemisphere following an early insult. BD language may signal defective maintenance of right hemispheric language caused by a late left hemispheric insult at a time when left dominance has already started to develop. In contrast, BI language may represent a variant with functional language representation in both hemispheres.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: Respiratory mechanisms are implicated in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We previously demonstrated a high incidence of ictal hypoxemia in temporal lobe seizures. We now report on the temporal relationship between ictal apnea and seizure onset and spread in patients undergoing video-EEG (electroencephalography) telemetry (VET) with intracranial electrodes. METHODS: Ten patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing VET were studied. Data from synchronously recorded digital pulse oximetry (SaO(2)), end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), nasal airflow, abdominal excursions, and electrocardiography were obtained. RESULTS: Sixty-one seizures were captured. SaO(2) in the ictal/postictal period was available for 52 seizures, apnea onset times for 27 seizures, and ETCO(2) for 16 seizures. Apneas occurred only when seizures spread to the contralateral temporal lobe. The mean delay to apnea onset was significantly shorter after contralateral seizure spread (2.87 s) than after seizure onset (58.4 s); p < 0.001. The mean SaO(2) nadir with partial seizures or partial seizures prior to secondary generalization was 89.4 +/- 8.6\% (91.5, 69-100). Following generalized convulsions the mean oxygen saturation nadir was 75.8 +/- 10.6\% (78.5, 58-90). ETCO(2) elevations occurred with each ictal desaturation below 85\%. CONCLUSIONS: There is a close temporal relationship between spread of seizures to the contralateral hemisphere and the onset of seizure-associated apnea. Apnea onsets are more tightly linked to time of contralateral spread than to time of seizure onset. Patients with TLE in whom there is evidence of contralateral seizure spread may be at higher risk for ictal-related respiratory dysfunction than those in whom seizures remain unilateral.",

Two postulated causes for SUDEP, cardiac and respiratory depression, can both be explained by overstimulation of adenosine receptors. We hypothesized that SUDEP is a consequence of a surge in adenosine as a result of prolonged seizures combined with deficient adenosine clearance; consequently, blockade of adenosine receptors should prevent SUDEP. Here we induced impaired adenosine clearance in adult mice by pharmacologic inhibition of the adenosine-removing enzymes, adenosine kinase and deaminase. Combination of impaired adenosine clearance with kainic acid-induced seizures triggered sudden death in all animals. Most importantly, the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine, when given after seizure onset, increased survival from 23.75 +/- 1.35 min to 54.86 +/- 6.59 min (p < 0.01). Our data indicate that SUDEP is due to overactivation of adenosine receptors and that caffeine treatment after seizure onset might be beneficial.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To determine if a small ultraviolet emitting diode (UV LED) could release sufficient gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from a caged precursor to suppress paroxysmal activity in rat brain slices. METHODS: Electrophysiologic recordings were obtained from rat brain slices bathed with caged GABA: 4-[[(2H-benzopyran-2-one-7-amino-4-methoxy)carbonyl]amino]butanoic acid (BC204), at concentrations between 3 and 30 microm. Seizure-like activity was induced by perfusing slices with extracellular medium lacking magnesium and containing 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 100 microm). A small, high-power UV LED was used to uncage BC204 and determine whether an increase in ambient GABA could alter normal or paroxysmal activity in the slice. RESULTS: UV LED illumination, in the absence of BC204, had no effect on CA1 population spikes or seizure-like activity. The light did induce a small temperature elevation (<0.15 degrees C) over the current intensities and exposure durations used in these experiments. In the presence of BC204, UV light decreased the CA1 population spike and seizure-like activity. The BC204 effect can be best accounted for by release of GABA: The reduction of population spikes and seizure-like activity was blocked by the GABA antagonist picrotoxin, and BC204 illumination produced a membrane polarization that reversed at the expected potential for GABA(A) receptors. DISCUSSION: These experiments establish that illumination of a low concentration of caged GABA with a tiny UV LED can release sufficient GABA to attenuate seizure-like activity in brain slices. Because our seizure model is very severe, it is probable that this technique would have a robust effect in human focal epilepsy.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the preemptive effect of NTS electrical stimulation on daily amygdaloid kindling (AK) in freely moving cats. METHODS: Seven adult male cats were used. Bipolar electrodes were stereotaxically implanted into both amygdalae, lateral geniculate bodies, hippocampi, and prefrontal cortices. In addition, a bipolar stainless steel electrode was implanted in the left NTS. Cats were recorded under the following experimental conditions: The NTS was stimulated for 6 days before the initiation of AK (1 min on/5 min off, 1 h total). AK was performed by stimulating the amygdala every 24 h (1 s, 60 Hz, 1 ms) until behavioral stage VI was reached. RESULTS: The number of stimulations to reach stage VI in control animals was 23.4 +/- 3.7, in lateral tegmental field (LTF) animals was 17.0 +/- 2.1 days. Animals subjected to preemptive NTS stimulation showed a significant increase (53.8 +/- 5.9). In addition, behavioral development was retarded, with an increase in the number of stimulations required to reach stage III. In this group, overall kindling development was delayed, and amygdaloid afterdischarge duration did not show a progressive increase as was observed in the control group. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that preemptive NTS electrical stimulation interferes with epileptogenesis. This anticonvulsive effect could be related to the activation of certain structures that inhibit seizure development. Therefore, results suggest that NTS mediates the anticonvulsive effect of vagus nerve stimulation.",

author = "Seyal, Masud and Bateman, Lisa M and Albertson, Timothy E and Lin, Tzu-Chun and Li, Chin-Shang",
abstract = "PURPOSE: The rate of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) approaches 9 per 1,000 patient-years in patients with refractory epilepsy. Respiratory causes are implicated in SUDEP. We reported that ictal hypoxemia occurs in one-third of seizures in localization-related epilepsy. We now report on respiratory changes in the ictal/postictal period including changes in end-tidal CO₂ (ETCO₂) that correlate directly with alveolar CO(2) , allowing a precise evaluation of seizure-related respiratory disturbances. METHODS: One hundred eighty-seven seizures were recorded in 33 patients with localization-related epilepsy, with or without secondarily generalized convulsions, undergoing video-electroencephalography (EEG) telemetry with recording of respiratory data. RESULTS: The ictal/postictal ETCO₂ increase from baseline was 14 $\pm$ 11 mm Hg (11, -1 to 50) [mean $\pm$ standard deviation (SD) (median, range)]. ETCO₂ peak was at or above 50 mm Hg with 35 of 94 seizures, 60 mm Hg with 15, and 70 mm Hg with five seizures. Eleven of the 33 patients had seizures with ETCO₂ elevation above 50 mm Hg. The duration of ictal/postictal ETCO(2) increase above baseline was 424 $\pm$ 807 s (154, 4 to 6225). The duration of ictal apnea was 49 $\pm$ 46 s (31, 6-222); most ictal apneic events were central. Oxygen desaturation to 60\% or less occurred with 10 seizures, including five that did not progress to generalized convulsions. Respiratory rate and amplitude increased postictally. The peak ictal ETCO₂ change and duration of change were not associated with apnea duration or seizure duration. Peak ETCO₂ change was significantly associated with contralateral seizure spread. CONCLUSIONS: Severe and prolonged increases in ETCO₂ occur with seizures. Postictally, respiratory effort is not impaired. Ictally triggered ventilation-perfusion inequality from pulmonary shunting or transient neurogenic pulmonary edema may account for these findings.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: We report a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of bilateral stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus for localization-related epilepsy. METHODS: Participants were adults with medically refractory partial seizures, including secondarily generalized seizures. Half received stimulation and half no stimulation during a 3-month blinded phase; then all received unblinded stimulation. RESULTS: One hundred ten participants were randomized. Baseline monthly median seizure frequency was 19.5. In the last month of the blinded phase the stimulated group had a 29\% greater reduction in seizures compared with the control group, as estimated by a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model (p = 0.002). Unadjusted median declines at the end of the blinded phase were 14.5\% in the control group and 40.4\% in the stimulated group. Complex partial and ``most severe'' seizures were significantly reduced by stimulation. By 2 years, there was a 56\% median percent reduction in seizure frequency; 54\% of patients had a seizure reduction of at least 50\%, and 14 patients were seizure-free for at least 6 months. Five deaths occurred and none were from implantation or stimulation. No participant had symptomatic hemorrhage or brain infection. Two participants had acute, transient stimulation-associated seizures. Cognition and mood showed no group differences, but participants in the stimulated group were more likely to report depression or memory problems as adverse events. DISCUSSION: Bilateral stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus reduces seizures. Benefit persisted for 2 years of study. Complication rates were modest. Deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamus is useful for some people with medically refractory partial and secondarily generalized seizures.",

To address this question we determined the susceptibility of mice with either a general or forebrain-restricted deletion of HCN1 to limbic seizure induction by amygdala kindling or pilocarpine administration. Loss of HCN1 expression in both mouse lines is associated with higher seizure severity and higher seizure-related mortality, independent of the seizure-induction method used. Therefore, down-regulation of HCN1 associated with human epilepsy and rodent models may be a contributing factor in seizure behavior.",

However, causes and mechanisms of depression in TLE remain poorly understood, and effective therapies are lacking. We examined whether a commonly used model of TLE in rats could be used as a model of comorbidity between epilepsy and depression suitable for both mechanistic studies and for the development of mechanism-based antidepressant therapies. We established that animals that had been subjected to lithium chloride and pilocarpine status epilepticus (SE) and developed spontaneous recurrent seizures, exhibited a set of impairments congruent with a depressive state: behavioral equivalents of anhedonia and despair, dysregulation of the hypothalamus--pituitary--adrenal (HPA) axis, and compromised raphe-hippocampal serotonergic transmission. Pharmacologic studies have suggested that depressive impairments following SE develop as a result of enhanced interleukin-1$\beta$ signaling in the hippocampus, which leads to depression via inducing perturbations in the HPA axis and subsequent deficit in the raphe-hippocampal serotonergic transmission.",

Both in sclerotic human hippocampi and in the chronic phase of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in mice with sclerosis, CB1-receptor--positive interneuron somata were preserved both in the dentate gyrus and in the CA1 area, and the density of CB1-immunostained fibers increased considerably in the dentate molecular layer. This suggests that, although CB1 receptors are known to be reduced in density on glutamatergic axons, the CB1-receptor--expressing GABAergic axons sprout, or there is an increase of CB1-receptor levels on these fibers. The changes of CB1 immunostaining in association with the GABAergic inhibitory system appear to correlate with the severity of pyramidal cell loss in the CA1 subfield. These results confirm the involvement of the endocannabinoid system associated with GABAergic transmission in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), as well as in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model in mice. Pharmacotherapy aimed at the modulation of endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling should take into account the opposite change in CB1-receptor expression observed on glutamatergic versus GABAergic axon terminals.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To investigate brain electrical activity in Q54 mice that display spontaneous seizures because of a gain-of-function mutation of the Scn2a sodium channel gene, and to evaluate the efficacy of low frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) for seizure frequency reduction. METHODS: Electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and hippocampal deep electrodes were implanted into Q54 mice expressing an epileptic phenotype (n = 6). Chronic six channel recordings (wideband, 0.1-300 Hz) were stored 24 h a day for more than 12 days. Low frequency stimulation (LFS) (3 Hz, square wave, biphasic, 100 $\mu$s, 400 $\mu$A) was applied to the ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) in alternating 5 min cycles (on or off) 24 h a day for a period of 4 days. RESULTS: LFS (3 Hz) resulted in a significant reduction in seizure frequency and duration (21\% and 35\%, p < 0.05), when applied to the VHC of epileptic Q54 mice (n = 6). Seizure frequency was not directly affected by stimulation state (``on'' vs. ``off''). CONCLUSION: LFS applied at a frequency of 3 Hz significantly reduced seizure frequency and duration in the Q54 model. Furthermore, the reduction of seizure frequency and duration by LFS was not immediate but had a delayed and lasting effect, supporting complex, indirect mechanisms of action.",

The mechanisms responsible for these associations are unclear. Herein we discuss the possibility that underlying pathology in the serotonin (5-HT) system of patients with epilepsy lowers the threshold for seizures, while also increasing the risk of depression and sudden death. We propose that postictal dysfunction of 5-HT neurons causes depression of breathing and arousal in some epilepsy patients, and this can lead to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We further draw parallels between SUDEP and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which may share pathophysiologic mechanisms, and which have both been linked to defects in the 5-HT system.",

Clinical manifestations at the onset, at the steady state, and during the course of the disease are analyzed in detail for the typical Dravet syndrome, and the differential diagnosis is discussed. Onset in the first year of life by febrile or afebrile clonic and tonic-clonic, generalized, and unilateral seizures, often prolonged, in an apparently normal infant is the first symptom, suggesting the diagnosis. Later on, multiple seizure types, mainly myoclonic, atypical absences, and focal seizures appear, as well as a slowing of developmental and cognitive skills, and the appearance of behavioral disorders. Mutation screening for the SCN1A gene confirms the diagnosis in 70-80\% of patients. All seizure types are pharmacoresistent, but a trend toward less severe epilepsy and cognitive impairment is usually observed after the age of 5 years.",

abstract = "Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in patients with Dravet syndrome and SCN1A mutations have shown abnormal findings in a small minority of patients. The origin of the structural abnormalities--such focal brain atrophy, cortical dysplasia, and hippocampal sclerosis--observed in some children remains unclear. There seems to be no correlation between the presence of MRI abnormalities and duration of epilepsy, age at seizure onset, or the frequency of episodes of status epilepticus having occurred early in life. Recent descriptions of Rasmussen syndrome and of the hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia syndrome in isolated patients with SCN1A mutations are of uncertain meaning but might indicate that co-occurring immunomediated or seizure-induced structural changes can, in turn, become a substrate for the severe epileptic encephalopathy. The few available neuropathologic studies of Dravet syndrome have provided inconsistent findings, including evidence of subtle brain malformation. However, the underlying dysfunction of the SCN1A gene might confer to the brain a unique profile of vulnerability whose consequences are not easily disclosed by neuropathology and require specific experimental settings to be fully appreciated. There would seem to be value in studies in animal models of these aspects, as well as prospective studies in humans, with a particular view to establishing if earlier diagnosis and efforts at seizure control may influence the development of any clinical, imaging, or pathologic deterioration.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: The objective of this systematic review was to identify: (1) prevalence and severity of psychiatric conditions before and after resective epilepsy surgery, (2) incidence of postsurgical psychiatric conditions, and (3) predictors of psychiatric status after surgery. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane database as part of a larger project on the development of an appropriateness and necessity rating tool to identify patients of all ages with potentially resectable focal epilepsy. The search yielded 5,061 articles related to epilepsy surgery and of the 763 articles meeting the inclusion criteria and reviewed in full text, 68 reported psychiatric outcomes. Thirteen articles met the final eligibility criteria. KEY FINDINGS: The studies demonstrated either improvements in psychiatric outcome postsurgery or no changes in psychiatric outcome. Only one study demonstrated deterioration in psychiatric status after surgery, with higher anxiety in the context of continued seizures post-surgery. One study reported a significantly increased rate of psychosis after surgery. The two main predictors of psychiatric outcome were seizure freedom and presurgical psychiatric history. De novo psychiatric conditions occurred postsurgery at a rate of 1.1-18.2\%, with milder psychiatric issues (e.g., adjustment disorder) being more common than more severe psychiatric issues (e.g., psychosis). SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, studies demonstrated either improvement in psychiatric outcomes postsurgery or no change. However, there is a need for more prospective, well-controlled studies to better delineate the prevalence and severity of psychiatric conditions occurring in the context of epilepsy surgery, and to identify specific predictors of psychiatric outcomes after epilepsy surgery.",

abstract = "Purpose: Hippocampal mossy cells receive dense innervation from dentate granule cells and, in turn, mossy cells innervate both granule cells and interneurons. Mossy cell loss is thought to trigger granule cell mossy fiber sprouting, which may affect granule cell excitability. The aim of this study was to quantify mossy cell loss in two animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy, and determine whether there exists a relationship between mossy cell loss, mossy fiber sprouting, and granule cell dispersion. Methods: Representative hippocampal sections from p35 knockout mice and mice with unilateral intrahippocampal kainate injection were immunolabeled for GluR2/3, two subunits of the amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor and calretinin to identify mossy cells. Mossy fibers were immunostained against synaptoporin. Key Findings: p35 Knockout mice showed no hilar cell death, but moderate mossy fiber sprouting and granule cell dispersion. In the kainate-injected hippocampus, there was an 80\% and 85\% reduction of GluR2/3- and GluR2/3/calretinin-positive hilar neurons, respectively, and dense mossy fiber sprouting and significant granule cell dispersion. In the contralateral hippocampus there was a 52\% loss of GluR2/3-, but only a 20\% loss of GluR2/3-calretinin-immunoreactive presumptive mossy cells, and granule cell dispersion; no mossy fiber sprouting was observed. Significance: These results indicate a probable lack of causality between mossy cell death and mossy fiber sprouting.",

In these mice, called Q54, spontaneous recurrent limbic motor seizures began at around 2 months of age and were accompanied by hippocampal sclerosis. We tested whether an enriched sensorimotor experience from birth (environmental enrichment) is effective in counteracting development of hyperexcitability and histopathologic changes in Q54 mice. We found that enriched Q54 animals displayed a dampened frequency of epileptic discharges and reduced hippocampal damage.

METHODS: NS-Pten knockouts were treated with a single course of rapamycin during postnatal weeks 4 and 5, or intermittently over a period of 5 months. Epileptiform activity was monitored using video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, and mossy fiber sprouting was evaluated using Timm staining. Survival and body weight were assessed in parallel. KEY FINDINGS: NS-Pten knockouts treated with a single course of rapamycin had recurrence of epilepsy 4-7 weeks after treatment ended. In contrast, epileptiform activity remained suppressed, and survival increased if knockout mice received additional rapamycin during weeks 10-11 and 16-17. Aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, present by 4 weeks of age and progressing in parallel with epileptiform activity, was also blocked by rapamycin. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that a single course of rapamycin treatment suppresses epileptiform activity and mossy fiber sprouting for several weeks before epilepsy recurs. However, additional intermittent treatments with rapamycin prevented this recurrence and enhanced survival without compromising growth. Therefore, these studies add to the growing body of evidence implicating an important role for mTORC1 signaling in epilepsy.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: Most people with epilepsy who die suddenly and whose death is attributed to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) are found in or by the bed for unknown reasons. We assessed whether those with sleep-related SUDEP were more likely to have nocturnal seizures, and whether seizure patterns (diurnal vs. nocturnal) differed from people dying suddenly and living controls with epilepsy. METHODS: Seizure patterns in a cohort of 154 people with epilepsy who died suddenly and after autopsy conformed to the definition of SUDEP and 616 controls living with epilepsy were classified as having ``exclusively diurnal'' or ``nocturnal seizures.'' Comparisons were made between the groups. SUDEP was classified as sleep-related or non-sleep-related based on eyewitness accounts and the circumstances surrounding death. KEY FINDINGS: SUDEP was primarily a sleep-related (58\%) and unwitnessed (86\%) event. If sleep-related, SUDEP was more likely to be unwitnessed [odds ratio (OR) 4.4, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-12]. Those with sleep-related SUDEP were more likely to have a history of nocturnal seizures than those who had non-sleep-related SUDEP (OR 3.6, 95\% CI 1.4-9.4). Those who died were more likely to have a history of nocturnal seizures than living controls (OR 3.9, 95\% CI 2.5-6.0). After correction for previously established SUDEP risk factors (Langan et al., 2005), the presence of nocturnal seizures remained significant (OR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.3-5.0). SIGNIFICANCE: Nocturnal seizures seem to be an independent risk factor for SUDEP. These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures, which may include night supervision.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: The relationship of postictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES) with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is controversial. It has been suggested that PGES is associated with respiratory inhibition leading to SUDEP, but the relationship between PGES and respiratory depression is unknown. Respiratory rate and amplitude of airflow increase following seizures but there is persistent hypercapnia and hypoxemia. To determine whether seizures with PGES result in respiratory dysfunction, we analyzed respiratory parameters recorded during video-EEG telemetry in patients with localization-related epilepsy. METHODS: Secondarily generalized convulsive seizures (GC) with PGES on scalp EEG or bilateral postictal attenuation (BA) on intracranial recordings were compared to GC without PGES/BA. Oxygen desaturation nadir and duration, end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2) ), apnea duration, and duration of the seizure and of the convulsive component were compared in GC with or without PGES/BA. KEY FINDINGS: There was no significant difference between GC with (n = 30) or without PGES/BA (n = 72) for total seizure duration or duration of the convulsion. GC with PGES/BA had a mean oxygen desaturation nadir of 68.8 $\pm$ 11.8\% (71.5, 43-88) (mean $\pm$ standard deviation [median, range]) that was lower (p = 0.002) than seizures without PGES/BA (76.31 $\pm$ 10.17\% [79, 42-93]). The duration of desaturation was significantly longer and peak ETCO(2) higher in GC with PGES/BA. There was no difference in apnea duration. Apnea did not start during PGES/BA and did not typically extend into the postictal period in GC with or without PGES/BA. SIGNIFICANCE: PGES is not associated with postictal central apnea but is more likely related to the severity of seizure-associated intrinsic pulmonary dysfunction.",

Mossy cells are the least well-characterized excitatory neurons in the hippocampus. Their somatic and dendritic morphology has been described qualitatively but not quantitatively. In the present study rat mossy cells were labeled intracellularly with biocytin in vivo. Somatic and dendritic structure was reconstructed three-dimensionally. For comparison, granule cells, CA3 pyramidal cells, and CA1 pyramidal cells were labeled and analyzed using the same approach. Among the four types of hippocampal neurons, granule cells had the smallest somata, fewest primary dendrites and dendritic branches, and shortest total dendritic length. CA1 pyramidal cells had the most dendritic branches and longest total dendritic length. Mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells both had large somata and similar total dendritic lengths. However, mossy cell dendrites branched less than CA3 pyramidal cells, especially close to the soma. These findings suggest that mossy cells have dendritic features that are not identical to any other type of hippocampal neuron. Therefore, electrotonic properties that depend on soma-dendritic structure are likely to be distinct in mossy cells compared to other neurons.",

author = "Scharfman, Helen E and Pierce, Joseph P",
abstract = "The dentate gyrus is one of two main areas of the mammalian brain where neurons are born throughout adulthood, a phenomenon called postnatal neurogenesis. Most of the neurons that are generated are granule cells (GCs), the major principal cell type in the dentate gyrus. Some adult-born granule cells develop in ectopic locations, such as the dentate hilus. The generation of hilar ectopic granule cells (HEGCs) is greatly increased in several animal models of epilepsy and has also been demonstrated in surgical specimens from patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Herein we review the results of our quantitative neuroanatomic analysis of HEGCs that were filled with Neurobiotin following electrophysiologic characterization in hippocampal slices. The data suggest that two types of HEGCs exist, based on a proximal or distal location of the cell body relative to the granule cell layer, and based on the location of most of the dendrites, in the molecular layer or hilus. Three-dimensional reconstruction revealed that the dendrites of distal HEGCs can extend along the transverse and longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Analysis of axons demonstrated that HEGCs have projections that contribute to the normal mossy fiber innervation of CA3 as well as the abnormal sprouted fibers in the inner molecular layer of epileptic rodents (mossy fiber sprouting). These data support the idea that HEGCs could function as a ``hub'' cell in the dentate gyrus and play a critical role in network excitability.",

abstract = "Summary Purpose:? Despite the development of new antiepileptic drugs, Dravet syndrome frequently remains therapy resistant and is a catastrophic epilepsy syndrome. Fenfluramine is an amphetamine-like drug that has been used in the past as a part of antiobesity treatments. Because of the possible cardiac adverse effects (valve thickening, pulmonary hypertension) associated with use of fenfluramine, it was withdrawn from the market in 2001. In Belgium, a Royal Decree permitted examination of the potential anticonvulsive effects of fenfluramine in a clinical trial consisting of a small group of patients diagnosed with Dravet syndrome. Methods:? Herein, we report 12 patients, 7 female and 5 male, with a genetically proven (11 of 12) diagnosis of Dravet syndrome who received fenfluramine as add-on therapy. Key Findings:? Their ages at their last evaluation ranged from 3?35?years. The mean dosage of fenfluramine was 0.34 (0.12?0.90)?mg/kg/day. Exposure duration to fenfluramine ranged from 1?19?years. Seven of the patients who were still receiving the fenfluramine treatment at the time of the last visit had been seizure-free for at least 1?year. In total, patients had been seizure-free for a mean of 6 (1?19)?years. In seven patients, the fenfluramine treatment was interrupted once during the follow-up; seizures reappeared in three of the seizure-free patients. Subsequent reintroduction of fenfluramine controlled the seizures in these three patients again. Only two patients exhibited a mild thickening of one or two cardiac valves without clinical significance. Significance:? Compared with a recent long-term follow-up series in which a maximum of 16\% of patients with Dravet syndrome were seizure-free, our result of 70\% of patients with Dravet syndrome remaining seizure-free is noteworthy. Given the limitations of this observational study, a larger prospective study should be undertaken to confirm these promising results.",

author = "Seyal, Masud and Bateman, Lisa M and Li, Chin-Shang",
abstract = "PURPOSE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality. Seizure-related respiratory dysfunction (RD), the duration of postictal generalized electroencephalography (EEG) suppression (PGES), and duration of postictal immobility (PI) may be important in the pathophysiology of SUDEP. Periictal interventions may reduce the risk of SUDEP. METHODS: We assessed the impact of periictal nursing interventions on RD, PGES, and PI duration in patients with localization-related epilepsy and secondarily generalized convulsions (GCs) recorded during video-EEG telemetry in the epilepsy monitoring unit. Video-EEG data were retrospectively reviewed. Interventions including administration of supplemental oxygen, oropharyngeal suction, and patient repositioning were evaluated. Interventions were performed based on nursing clinical judgment at the bedside and were not randomized. The two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare GCs with and those without intervention. Robust simple linear regression was used to assess the association between timing of intervention and duration of hypoxemia (SaO(2) 2 s occurred following 31 GCs in 16 patients. There were 21 GCs with no intervention (NOINT) and 84 GC with interventions (INT). In the INT group, the duration of hypoxemia was shorter (p = 0.0014) when intervention occurred before hypoxemia onset (mean duration 53.1 s) than when intervention was delayed (mean duration 132.42 s). Linear regression indicated that in GCs with nursing interventions, earlier intervention was associated with shorter duration of hypoxemia (p < 0.0001) and shorter duration of PGES (p = 0.0012). Seizure duration (p < 0.0001) and convulsion duration (p = 0.0457) were shorter with earlier intervention. PI duration was longer for GCs with PGES than GCs without PGES (p < 0.0001). The mean delay to first active nonrespiratory movement following GCs with PGES was 251.96 s and for GC without PGES was 66.06 s. The duration of PI was positively associated with lower SaO(2) nadir (p = 0.003) and longer duration of oxygen desaturation (p = 0.0026). There was no association between PI duration and seizure duration (p = 0.773), between PI duration and PGES duration (p = 0.758), or between PI duration and the timing of first intervention relative to seizure onset (p = 0.823). PGES did not occur in the NOINT group. The mean duration of desaturation was longer (110.9 vs. 49.9 s) (p < 0.0001), mean SaO(2) nadir was lower (72.8\% vs. 79.7\%) (p = 0.0086), and mean end-tidal CO(2) was higher (58.6 vs. 50.3 mmHg) (p = 0.0359) in the INT group compared with the NOINT group. The duration of the seizure or of the convulsive component was not significantly different between the INT and NOINT groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Early periictal nursing intervention was associated with reduced duration of RD and reduced duration of PGES. These findings suggest the possibility that such interventions may be effective in reducing the risk of SUDEP in the outpatient setting. Validation of these preliminary data with a prospective study is needed before definitive conclusions can be reached regarding the efficacy of periictal interventions in reducing the risk of SUDEP.",

I(NaP) is activated in the subthreshold voltage range and is capable of amplifying a neuron's response to synaptic input and enhancing its repetitive firing capability. A burgeoning literature is documenting mutations in sodium channels that underlie human disease, including epilepsy.

Most of this research has utilized experimental models in which intense electrical activity in adult animals, primarily involving status epilepticus, causes variable neuronal death in the hippocampus and other temporal lobe structures. Neuronal death, including principal cells and specific interneurons, likely has several roles in epileptogenesis after brain injury. Both reduction of GABA-mediated inhibition from selective interneuron loss and the progressive formation of new recurrent excitatory circuits after death of principal neurons enhance excitability and promote seizures during the development of epilepsy. These epileptogenic circuits hypothetically continue to undergo secondary epileptogenesis, which involves further modifications that contribute to a progressive, albeit variable, increase in the frequency and severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures.",

Mood disorders are the most common culprit (24-74\%), particularly depression (30\%), followed by anxiety disorders (10-25\%), psychoses (2-7\%) and personality disorders (1-2\%).

Genetic analysis revealed 6 (13\%) non-synonymous (amino acid changing) variants in KCNH2 (n = 2) and SCN5A (n = 4), all previously reported in LQTS patients. Specifically, KCNH2 Arg176Trp and SCN5A Pro1090Leu were identified once in SUDEP cases and absent in control alleles. Both DNA variants have been previously identified in the pathogenesis of LQTS.

Among ionotropic glutamate receptors, kainate receptors (KARs) have been least explored and their relevance to pathophysiology is relatively obscure. This is in part due to the relatively low abundance of KARs, the regulatory function in network activity they play, the lack of specific agonists and antagonists for this receptor subtype, as well as to the absence of striking phenotypes in mice deficient in KAR subunits. Nonetheless, it is now well established that KARs are located presynaptically whereby they regulate glutamate and GABA release, and thus, excitability and participate in short-term plasticity. In turn, KARs are also located postsynaptically and their activation contributes to synaptic integration. The development of specific novel ligands is helping to further investigate the contribution of KARs to health and disease. In this review, I summarize current knowledge about KAR physiology and pharmacology, and discuss their involvement in cell death and disease. In addition, I recapitulate the available data about the use of KAR antagonists and receptor subunit deficient mice in experimental paradigms of brain diseases, as well as the main findings about KAR roles in human CNS disorders. In sum, subunit specific antagonists have therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases as well as in epilepsy and pain.

To directly address this question, we injected a ``floxed'' anterograde tracer (rAAV5/EF1a-DIO-mCherry) into the BNSTov of CRFp3.0Cre(GFP) transgenic mice, which express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the CRF promoter. Serial sections were then analyzed for the presence of double-labeled fibers in potential projection sites. To determine whether CRF neurons in the rat BNSTov send comparable projections, we infused rat BNSTov with an AAV in which the human synapsin promoter drives enhanced GFP expression. We then used CRF immunoreactivity to examine double-labeled fluorescent fibers and axon terminals in projection sites from brain sections of the AAV-infused rats. We have observed several terminal fields in the mouse and rat brain with double-labeled fibers in the Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRD), the Paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and to a lesser extent in the Ventral tegmental area. We found double-labeled terminal boutons in the nucleus accumbens shell, prelimbic cortex, and posterior basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. The most intense double-labeling was found in midbrain, including substantia nigra pars compacta, red nucleus, periaqueductal gray, pontine nuclei, as well as DRD. The results of our study indicate that CRF neurons are the output neurons of the BNSTov and they send projections to the centers of neuroendocrine and autonomic regulation, but also regions modulating reward and motivation, vigilance, motor function, as well as affective behavior.

abstract = "The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behaviour and communication, but the sources of AVP release relevant for behaviour have not been precisely determined. Ablations of the sexually dimorphic AVP cells within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), which are more numerous in males, affect social behaviour differently in males and females. However, it is unknown whether these behavioural effects are caused by a reduction of AVP or of other factors associated with these cells. To test the role of AVP specifically, we used an shRNA viral construct to knock down AVP gene expression within the BNST of wild-type male and female mice, using scrambled sequence virus as a control, and evaluated subsequent changes in social behaviours (social investigation, ultrasonic vocalization (USV), scent marking, copulation, and aggression), or anxiety-like behaviours (elevated plus maze). We observed that, in males, knockdown of AVP expression in the BNST strongly reduced investigation of novel males, aggressive signalling towards other males (tail rattling, USV), and copulatory behaviour, but did not alter attack initiation, other measures of social communication, or anxiety-like behaviours. In females, however, BNST AVP knockdown did not alter any of these behaviours. These results point to differential involvement of AVP derived from the BNST in social behaviour.",

The 2013 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification segregates HS into typical (type 1) and atypical (type 2 and 3) groups, based on the histological patterns of subfield neuronal loss and gliosis. In addition, granule cell reorganization and alterations of interneuronal populations, neuropeptide fibre networks and mossy fibre sprouting are distinctive features of HS associated with epilepsies; they can be useful diagnostic aids to discriminate from other causes of HS, as well as highlighting potential mechanisms of hippocampal epileptogenesis. The cause of HS remains elusive and may be multifactorial; the contribution of febrile seizures, genetic susceptibility, inflammatory and neurodevelopmental factors are discussed. Post-mortem based research in HS, as an addition to studies on surgical samples, has the added advantage of enabling the study of the wider network changes associated with HS, the long-term effects of epilepsy on the pathology and associated comorbidities. It is likely that HS is heterogeneous in aspects of its cause, epileptogenetic mechanisms, network alterations and response to medical and surgical treatments. Future neuropathological studies will contribute to better recognition and understanding of these clinical and patho-aetiological subtypes of HS.",

abstract = "AIMS: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is one of the leading causes of death in people with epilepsy. For classification of definite SUDEP, a post mortem (PM), including anatomical and toxicological examination, is mandatory to exclude other causes of death. We audited PM practice as well as the value of brain examination in SUDEP. METHODS: We reviewed 145 PM reports in SUDEP cases from four UK neuropathology centres. Data were extracted for clinical epilepsy details, circumstances of death and neuropathological findings. RESULTS: Macroscopic brain abnormalities were identified in 52\% of cases. Mild brain swelling was present in 28\%, and microscopic pathologies relevant to cause or effect of seizures were seen in 89\%. Examination based on whole fixed brains (76.6\% of all PMs), and systematic regional sampling was associated with higher detection rates of underlying pathology (P < 0.01). Information was more frequently recorded regarding circumstances of death and body position/location than clinical epilepsy history and investigations. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the contribution of examination of the whole fixed brain in SUDEP, with high rates of detection of relevant pathology. Availability of full clinical epilepsy-related information at the time of PM could potentially further improve detection through targeted tissue sampling. Apart from confirmation of SUDEP, complete neuropathological examination contributes to evaluation of risk factors as well as helping to direct future research into underlying causes.",

abstract = "In many patients who suffer from epilepsies, recurrent epileptic seizures do not start at birth but develop later in life. This holds particularly true for epilepsies with a focal seizure origin including focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). TLE most frequently has its seizure onset in the hippocampal formation. Hippocampal biopsies of pharmacoresistant TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for seizure control most frequently reveal the damage pattern of hippocampal sclerosis, i.e. segmental neuronal cell loss and concomitant astrogliosis. Many TLE patients report on transient brain insults early in life, which is followed by a 'latency' period lacking seizure activity of months or even years before chronic recurrent seizures start. The plethora of structural and cellular mechanisms that convert the hippocampal formation to become chronically hyperexcitable after a transient insult to the brain are summarized under the term epileptogenesis. In contrast to the obstacles arising for experimental studies of epileptogenesis aspects in human surgical hippocampal tissue, recent animal model approaches allow insights into mechanisms of epileptogenesis. Relevant models of transient brain insults in this context comprise several distinct types of lesions including excitoxic status epilepticus (SE), electrical seizure induction, traumatic brain injury (TBI), induction of inflammatory processes by hyperthermia and viral inflammation and others. In pathogenetic terms, aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming, acquired channel- and synaptopathies, neuronal network and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) dysfunction as well as innate and adaptive immunity mediated damage play major roles. In subsequent steps, respective animal models have been used in order to test whether this dynamic process can be either retarded or even abolished by interfering with epileptogenic mechanisms. Well controlled subsequent analyses of epileptogenic cascades characterized in animal models using carefully stratified human hippocampal biopsies to exploit the unique opportunities given by these rare and precious brain tissue samples aim to translate into novel anti-epileptogenic approaches. Respective pre-clinical tests can open entirely new perspectives for tailor-made treatments in patients with the potential to avoid the emergence of chronic focal seizure events.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: The brain and the gut communicate bidirectionally through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The vagus nerve (VN), a major component of the ANS, plays a key role in the neuro-endocrine-immune axis to maintain homeostasia through its afferents (through the activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and the central ANS) and through its efferents (i.e. the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; CAP). The CAP has an anti-TNF effect both through the release of acetylcholine at the distal VN acting on macrophages and through the connection of the VN with the spleen through the splenic sympathetic nerve. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) of vagal afferents at high frequency (20-30 Hz) is used for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and depression. Low-frequency (5 Hz) VNS of vagal efferents activates the CAP for an anti-inflammatory effect that is as an anti-TNF therapy in inflammatory diseases were TNF is a key cytokine as represented by experimental sepsis, postoperative ileus, burn-induced intestinal barrier injury, colitis. However, both vagal afferents and efferents are activated by VNS. PURPOSE: The objective of this review was to explore the following: (i) the supporting evidence for the importance of VNS in epilepsy (and depression) and its mechanisms of action, (ii) the anti-inflammatory characteristics of the VN, (iii) the experimental evidence that VNS impact on inflammatory disorders focusing on the digestive tract, and (iv) how VNS could potentially be harnessed therapeutically in human inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, postoperative ileus, rheumatoid arthritis as an anti-inflammatory therapy.",

abstract = "NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Does activation of serotonergic neurons in the caudal medullary raphe, some of which project to the nucleus of the solitary tract, shorten the laryngeal chemoreflex? What is the main finding and its importance? We found that serotonin originating from neurons in the caudal raphe acts through a 5-HT3 receptor located in the nucleus of the solitary tract to terminate reflex apnoea. Failure or deficiency of this arousal-related process is likely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome. Failure to terminate apnoea and arouse is likely to contribute to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Serotonin is deficient in the brainstems of babies who have died of SIDS. We tested the hypothesis that activation of serotoninergic neurons in the caudal medullary raphe, some of which project to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), would shorten the laryngeal chemoreflex (LCR). We studied anaesthetized neonatal rat pups between postnatal days 9 and 17. We injected 5-40 $\mu$l of water into the larynx to elicit the LCR and measured the duration of respiratory disruption. Microinjection of 50 nl of 100 $\mu$m AMPA into the caudal medullary raphe shortened the apnoeas (P < 0.001) and respiratory inhibition (P < 0.005) associated with the LCR. When 50 nl of 30 mm ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, was microinjected bilaterally into the NTS, AMPA microinjected into the caudal raphe no longer shortened the LCR. After bilateral microinjection of vehicle into the NTS, AMPA microinjection into the caudal raphe significantly shortened the LCR. AMPA, a glutamate receptor agonist, may activate many neurons within the caudal raphe, but blocking the 5-HT3 receptor-dependent responses in the NTS prevented the shortening of the LCR associated with AMPA microinjections into the caudal raphe. Thus, serotonin originating from neurons in the caudal raphe acts through a 5-HT3 receptor located in the NTS to terminate or shorten the LCR. Serotonin is deficient in the brainstems of babies who have died of SIDS, and deficient serotonergic termination of apnoea is likely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of SIDS.",

abstract = "The dentate gyrus is a region subject to intense study in epilepsy because of its posited role as a 'gate', acting to inhibit overexcitation in the hippocampal circuitry through its unique synaptic, cellular and network properties that result in relatively low excitability. Numerous changes predicted to produce dentate hyperexcitability are seen in epileptic patients and animal models. However, recent findings question whether changes are causative or reactive, as well as the pathophysiological relevance of the dentate in epilepsy. Critically, direct in vivo modulation of dentate 'gate' function during spontaneous seizure activity has not been explored. Therefore, using a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, a closed-loop system and selective optogenetic manipulation of granule cells during seizures, we directly tested the dentate 'gate' hypothesis in vivo. Consistent with the dentate gate theory, optogenetic gate restoration through granule cell hyperpolarization efficiently stopped spontaneous seizures. By contrast, optogenetic activation of granule cells exacerbated spontaneous seizures. Furthermore, activating granule cells in non-epileptic animals evoked acute seizures of increasing severity. These data indicate that the dentate gyrus is a critical node in the temporal lobe seizure network, and provide the first in vivo support for the dentate 'gate' hypothesis.",

abstract = "KEY POINTS: Central hypercapnic hypoventilation is highly prevalent in children suffering from congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Mutations of the gene for paired-like homeobox 2b (Phox2b) are aetiologically associated with CCHS and Phox2b is present in central components of respiratory chemoreflex, such as the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Injection of the neurotoxin substance P-saporin into NTS destroys Phox2b-expressing neurons. Impaired hypercapnic ventilatory response caused by this neurotoxin is attributable to a loss of CO2 -sensitive Phox2b-expressing NTS neurons. A subgroup of Phox2b-expressing neurons exhibits intrinsic chemosensitivity. A background K+ channel-like current is partially responsible for such chemosensitivity in Phox2b-expressing neurons. The present study helps us better understand the mechanism of respiratory deficits in CCHS and potentially locates a brainstem site for development of precise clinical intervention. ABSTRACT: The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) neurons have been considered to function as central respiratory chemoreceptors. However, the common molecular marker defined for these neurons remains unknown. The present study investigated whether paired-like homeobox 2b (Phox2b)-expressing NTS neurons are recruited in hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) and whether these neurons exhibit intrinsic chemosensitivity. HCVR was assessed using whole body plethysmography and neuronal chemosensitivity was examined by patch clamp recordings in brainstem slices or dissociated neurons from Phox2b-EGFP transgenic mice. Injection of the neurotoxin substance P-saporin (SSP-SAP) into NTS destroyed Phox2b-expressing neurons. Minute ventilation and tidal volume were both reduced by 13\% during exposure to 8\% CO2 in inspired air when ∼13\% of the Phox2b-expressing neurons were eliminated. However, a loss of ∼18\% of these neurons was associated with considerable decreases in minute ventilation by $\geq$18\% and in tidal volume by$\geq$22\% when challenged by $\geq$4\% CO2 . In both cases, breathing frequency was unaffected. Most CO2 -activated neurons were immunoreactive to Phox2b. In brainstem slices, ∼43\% of Phox2b-expressing neurons from Phox2b-EGFP mice displayed a sustained or transient increase in firing rate during physiological acidification (pH 7.0 or 8\% CO2 ). Such a response was also present in dissociated neurons in favour of an intrinsic property. In voltage clamp recordings, a background K+ channel-like current was found in a subgroup of Phox2b-expressing neurons. Thus, the respiratory deficits caused by injection of SSP-SAP into the NTS are attributable to proportional lesions of CO2 /H+ -sensitive Phox2b-expressing neurons.",

abstract = "By applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a physiological tool to evaluate changes in functional connectivity between key brainstem nuclei in the baroreflex neural circuits of mice and rats, recent work has revealed several hitherto unidentified phenomena regarding baroreflex functionality. (1) The presence of robust functional connectivity between nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and nucleus ambiguus (NA) or rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) offers a holistic view on the moment-to-moment modus operandi of the cardiac vagal baroreflex or baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone. (2) Under pathophysiological conditions (e.g. neurogenic hypertension), the disruption of functional connectivity between key nuclei in the baroreflex circuits is reversible. However, fatality ensues on progression from pathophysiological to pathological conditions (e.g. hepatic encephalopathy) when the functional connectivity between NTS and NA or RVLM is irreversibly severed. (3) The absence of functional connectivity between the NTS and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) necessitates partial rewiring of the classical neural circuit that includes CVLM as an inhibitory intermediate between the NTS and RVLM. (4) Sustained functional connectivity between the NTS and NA is responsible for the vital period between brain death and the inevitable cardiac death. (5) Reduced functional connectivity between the NTS and RVLM or NA points to inherent anomalous baroreflex functionality in floxed and Cre-Lox mice. (6) Disrupted NTS-NA functional connectivity in Flk-1 (VEGFR2) deficient mice offers an explanation for the hypertensive side-effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (anti-VEGF) therapy.

We found that in free-running mice circadian phase alters vulnerability to seizure-induced death. These findings suggest that circadian rhythmicity may be responsible for the increased nighttime prevalence of SUDEP ABSTRACT: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related death. SUDEP typically happens during the night following a seizure. Many aspects of mammalian physiology are regulated by circadian rhythms in ways that might make seizures that occur during the night more dangerous. Using two mouse models of seizure-induced death we demonstrate that time-of-day and circadian rhythms alter vulnerability to seizure-induced death. We exposed normally entrained DBA/1 mice to a potentially seizure-inducing acoustic stimulus at different times of day and compared the characteristics and outcomes of the seizures. Time-of-day did not alter the likelihood of a seizure, but it did alter the likelihood of seizure-induced death. To determine whether circadian rhythms alter vulnerability to seizure-induced death we induced maximal electroshock seizures in free-running C57BL/6J mice at different circadian time points while measuring breathing via whole body plethysmography. Circadian phase did not affect seizure severity, but it did alter postictal respiratory outcomes and the likelihood of seizure-induced death. Contrary to our expectations, in entrained and free-running mice, vulnerability to seizure-induced death was greatest during the night and subjective night, respectively. These findings suggest that circadian rhythmicity may be responsible for the increased nighttime prevalence of SUDEP and that the underlying mechanism is phase conserved between nocturnal and diurnal mammals. All seizures in this investigation were induced during wakefulness indicating that the effect of time point on vulnerability to seizure-induced death was not the result of sleep. Understanding why SUDEP happens more during the night may inform future preventative countermeasures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

author = "Fisahn, Andr{\'e}",
abstract = "Rhythmic electrical activity is ubiquitous in neuronal networks of the brain and is implicated in a multitude of different processes. A prominent example in the healthy brain is electrical oscillations in the gamma-frequency band (20--80 Hz) in hippocampal and neocortical networks, which play an important role in learning, memory and cognition. An example in the pathological brain is electrographic seizures observed in certain types of epilepsy. Interestingly the activation of kainate receptors (KARs) plays an important role in synaptic physiology and plasticity, and can generate both gamma oscillations and electrographic seizures. Electrophysiological recordings of extracellular gamma oscillations and intracellular currents in a hippocampal slice combined with computer modelling can shed light on the expression loci of KAR subunits on single neurones and the distinct roles subunits play in rhythmic activity in the healthy and the pathologicalal brain. Using this approach in wild-type (WT) and KAR knockout mice it has been shown that KAR subunits GluR5 and GluR6 have similar functions during gamma oscillations and epileptiform bursts and that small changes in the overall activity in the hippocampal area CA3 can tilt the balance between excitation and inhibition and cause the neuronal network to switch from gamma oscillations to epileptiform bursts.",

author = "Huda, Rafiq and Pollema-Mays, Sarah L and Chang, Zheng and Alheid, George F and McCrimmon, Donald R and Martina, Marco",
abstract = "Cellular mechanisms of central pH chemosensitivity remain largely unknown. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) integrates peripheral afferents with central pathways controlling breathing; NTS neurons function as central chemosensors, but only limited information exists concerning the ionic mechanisms involved. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) mediate chemosensitivity in nociceptive terminals, where pH values ∼6.5 are not uncommon in inflammation, but are also abundantly expressed throughout the brain where pHi s tightly regulated and their role is less clear. Here we test the hypothesis that ASICs are expressed in NTS neurons and contribute to intrinsic chemosensitivity and control of breathing. In electrophysiological recordings from acute rat NTS slices, ∼40\% of NTS neurons responded to physiological acidification (pH 7.0) with a transient depolarization. This response was also present in dissociated neurons suggesting an intrinsic mechanism. In voltage clamp recordings in slices, a pH drop from 7.4 to 7.0 induced ASIC-like inward currents (blocked by 100 $\mu$M amiloride) in ∼40\% of NTS neurons, while at pH $\leq$ 6.5 these currents were detected in all neurons tested; RT-PCR revealed expression of ASIC1 and, less abundantly, ASIC2 in the NTS. Anatomical analysis of dye-filled neurons showed that ASIC-dependent chemosensitive cells (cells responding to pH 7.0) cluster dorsally in the NTS. Using in vivo retrograde labelling from the ventral respiratory column, 90\% (9/10) of the labelled neurons showed an ASIC-like response to pH 7.0, suggesting that ASIC currents contribute to control of breathing. Accordingly, amiloride injection into the NTS reduced phrenic nerve activity of anaesthetized rats with an elevated arterial P(CO(2)) .",

author = "Vargas, Ernesto and Petrou, Steven and Reid, Christopher A",
abstract = "The expression of Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1) is responsible for high intracellular Cl(-) resulting in the excitatory action of GABA(A) receptor activation in the developing brain. Giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) are spontaneous network oscillations that involve GABA(A) receptors and are thought to be important in establishing neuronal circuit wiring. Earlier work established that seizure susceptibility in the GABA(A) $\gamma$2(R43Q) epilepsy mouse is impacted by developmental consequences of impaired GABA(A) receptor function. We investigated the potential mechanism of the developmental influence by recording GDPs in the CA3 pyramidal neurons from brain slices of the neonatal GABA(A) $\gamma$2(R43Q) mouse. Interestingly, the number of GPDs was significantly lower in slices from mutant mouse compared with wild-type control, suggesting an involvement in setting seizure susceptibility. To test this idea we blocked NKCC1 with bumetanide in neonatal mice and reduced the number of GDPs to a level similar to that seen in the mutant mice. We found that neonatal treatment with bumetanide resulted in a similar level of susceptibility to thermally induced seizures as described for the GABA(A) $\gamma$2(R43Q) mouse. These results provide evidence that a human GABA(A) receptor epilepsy mutation exerts a developmental influence by modulating the number of GDPs. It also draws attention to the potential risk of early treatment with bumetanide.",

author = "Zhao, Huan and Peters, James H and Zhu, Mingyan and Page, Stephen J and Ritter, Robert C and Appleyard, Suzanne M",
abstract = "Hindbrain NMDA receptors play important roles in reflexive and behavioural responses to vagal activation. NMDA receptors have also been shown to contribute to the synaptic responses of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), but their exact role remains unclear. In this study we used whole cell patch-clamping techniques in rat horizontal brain slice to investigate the role of NMDA receptors in the fidelity of transmission across solitary tract afferent-NTS neuron synapses. Results show that NMDA receptors contribute up to 70\% of the charge transferred across the synapse at high (>5 Hz) firing rates, but have little contribution at lower firing frequencies. Results also show that NMDA receptors critically contribute to the fidelity of transmission across these synapses during high frequency (>5 Hz) afferent discharge rates. This novel role of NMDA receptors may explain in part how primary visceral afferents, including vagal afferents, can maintain fidelity of transmission across a broad range of firing frequencies. Neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) receive vagal afferent innervations that initiate gastrointestinal and cardiovascular reflexes. Glutamate is the fast excitatory neurotransmitter released in the NTS by vagal afferents, which arrive there via the solitary tract (ST). ST stimulation elicits excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in NTS neurons mediated by both AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors (-Rs). Vagal afferents exhibit a high probability of vesicle release and exhibit robust frequency-dependent depression due to presynaptic vesicle depletion. Nonetheless, synaptic throughput is maintained even at high frequencies of afferent activation. Here we test the hypothesis that postsynaptic NMDA-Rs are essential in maintaining throughput across ST-NTS synapses. Using patch clamp electrophysiology in horizontal brainstem slices, we found that NMDA-Rs, including NR2B subtypes, carry up to 70\% of the charge transferred across the synapse during high frequency stimulations (>5 Hz). In contrast, their relative contribution to the ST-EPSC is much less during low (<2 Hz) frequency stimulations. Afferent-driven activation of NMDA-Rs produces a sustained depolarization during high, but not low, frequencies of stimulation as a result of relatively slow decay kinetics. Hence, NMDA-Rs are critical for maintaining action potential generation at high firing rates. These results demonstrate a novel role for NMDA-Rs enabling a high probability of release synapse to maintain the fidelity of synaptic transmission during high frequency firing when glutamate release and AMPA-R responses are reduced. They also suggest why NMDA-Rs are critical for responses that may depend on high rates of afferent discharge.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. Defects in central control of breathing are important contributors to the pathophysiology of SUDEP, and serotonin (5-HT) system dysfunction may be involved. Here we examined the effect of 5-HT neurone elimination or 5-HT reduction on seizure risk and seizure-induced mortality. Adult Lmx1b(f/f/p) mice, which lack >99\% of 5-HT neurones in the CNS, and littermate controls (Lmx1b(f/f)) were subjected to acute seizure induction by maximal electroshock (MES) or pilocarpine, variably including electroencephalography, electrocardiography, plethysmography, mechanical ventilation or pharmacological therapy. Lmx1b(f/f/p) mice had a lower seizure threshold and increased seizure-induced mortality. Breathing ceased during most seizures without recovery, whereas cardiac activity persisted for up to 9 min before terminal arrest. The mortality rate of mice of both genotypes was reduced by mechanical ventilation during the seizure or 5-HT2A receptor agonist pretreatment. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram reduced mortality of Lmx1b(f/f) but not of Lmx1b(f/f/p) mice. In C57BL/6N mice, reduction of 5-HT synthesis with para-chlorophenylalanine increased MES-induced seizure severity but not mortality. We conclude that 5-HT neurones raise seizure threshold and decrease seizure-related mortality. Death ensued from respiratory failure, followed by terminal asystole. Given that SUDEP often occurs in association with generalised seizures, some mechanisms causing death in our model might be shared with those leading to SUDEP. This model may help determine the relationship between seizures, 5-HT system dysfunction, breathing and death, which may lead to novel ways to prevent SUDEP.",

However, the anticonvulsant potential of cannabinoids and, moreover, the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in regulating seizure activity has not been tested in an in vivo model of epilepsy that is characterized by spontaneous, recurrent seizures. Here, using the rat pilocarpine model of epilepsy, we show that the marijuana extract Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (10 mg/kg) as well as the cannabimimetic, 4,5-dihydro-2-methyl-4(4-morpholinylmethyl)-1-(1-naphthalenyl-carbonyl)-6H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-i,j]quinolin-6-one [R(+)WIN55,212 (5 mg/kg)], completely abolished spontaneous epileptic seizures. Conversely, application of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1) antagonist, N-(piperidin-1-yl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamidehydrochloride (SR141716A), significantly increased both seizure duration and frequency. In some animals, CB1 receptor antagonism resulted in seizure durations that were protracted to a level consistent with the clinical condition status epilepticus. Furthermore, we determined that during an short-term pilocarpine-induced seizure, levels of the endogenous CB1 ligand 2-arachidonylglycerol increased significantly within the hippocampal brain region. These data indicate not only anticonvulsant activity of exogenously applied cannabinoids but also suggest that endogenous cannabinoid tone modulates seizure termination and duration through activation of the CB1 receptor. Furthermore, Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that CB1 receptor protein expression was significantly increased throughout the CA regions of epileptic hippocampi. By demonstrating a role for the endogenous cannabinoid system in regulating seizure activity, these studies define a role for the endogenous cannabinoid system in modulating neuroexcitation and suggest that plasticity of the CB1 receptor occurs with epilepsy.",

WIN 55,212-2 produced dose-dependent anticonvulsant effects against both spontaneous recurrent epileptiform discharges (SRED) (EC50 = 0.85 microM) and SE (EC50 = 1.51 microM), with total suppression of seizure activity at 3 microM and of SE activity at 5 microM. The anticonvulsant properties of WIN 55,212-2 in these preparations were both stereospecific and blocked by the cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamidehydrochloride (SR141716A; 1 microM), showing a CB1 receptor-dependent pathway. The inhibitory effect of WIN 55,212-2 against low Mg2+-induced SE is the first observation in this model of total suppression of SE by a selective pharmacological agent. The clinically used anticonvulsants phenytoin and phenobarbital were not able to abolish low Mg2+-induced SE at concentrations up to 150 microM. The results from this study show CB1 receptor-mediated anticonvulsant effects of the cannabimimetic WIN 55,212-2 against both SRED and low Mg2+-induced SE in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures and show that these in vitro models of AE and SE may represent powerful tools to investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of cannabinoids on neuronal excitability.",

abstract = "Recently, cannabis has been suggested as a potential alternative therapy for refractory epilepsy, which affects 30\% of epilepsy patients including children who do not respond to current medications. There is a large unmet medical need for new antiepileptics for refractory epilepsy and conditions associated with refractory seizures that would not interfere with normal function. The two chief cannabinoids are delta-9-tetrahyrdrocannabinol, the major psychoactive component of marijuana, and cannabidiol (CBD), the major non-psychoactive component of marijuana. There are claims of clinical efficacy of CBD-predominant cannabis or medical marijuana for epilepsy, mostly from limited studies, surveys or case reports. However, the mechanisms underlying the antiepileptic efficacy of cannabis remain unclear. This article highlights the pharmacological basis of cannabis therapy, with an emphasis on the endocannabinoid mechanisms underlying the emerging neurotherapeutics of CBD in epilepsy. CBD is anticonvulsant, but it has a low affinity for the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors; therefore the exact mechanism by which it affects seizures remains poorly understood. A rigorous clinical evaluation of pharmaceutical CBD products is needed to establish the safety and efficacy for the treatment of epilepsy. Identification of mechanisms underlying the anticonvulsant efficacy of CBD is additionally critical to identify other potential treatment options.",

Aggression is seen in a minority of people with epilepsy. It is rarely seizure related but is interictal, sometimes occurring as part of complex psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities, and it is sometimes associated with AED treatment. We review the common neurotransmitter systems and brain regions implicated in both epilepsy and aggression, including the GABA, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline systems and the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and temporal lobes. Few controlled clinical studies have used behavioral measures to specifically examine aggression with AEDs, and most evidence comes from adverse event reporting from clinical and observational studies. A systematic approach was used to identify relevant publications, and we present a comprehensive, evidence-based summary of available data surrounding aggression-related behaviors with each of the currently available AEDs in both adults and in children/adolescents with epilepsy. A psychiatric history and history of a propensity toward aggression/anger should routinely be sought from patients, family members, and carers; its presence does not preclude the use of any specific AEDs, but those most likely to be implicated in these behaviors should be used with caution in such cases.",

Here, we report that the PBN receives dense inputs from two discrete neuronal populations in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), an extended amygdala structure that encodes affective information. Using a series of complementary approaches, we identify opposing BNST-PBN circuits that modulate neuropeptide-expressing PBN neurons to control feeding and affective states.

An experimental model that replicates this pattern of damage in normal animals by electrical stimulation of the afferent pathway to the hippocampus was developed to study changes in structure and function that occur as a result of repetitive seizures. Hippocampal granule cell seizure activity caused a persistent loss of recurrent inhibition and irreversibly damaged adjacent interneurons. Immunocytochemical staining revealed unexpectedly that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons, thought to mediate inhibition in this region and predicted to be damaged by seizures, had survived. In contrast, there was a nearly complete loss of adjacent somatostatin-containing interneurons and mossy cells that may normally activate inhibitory neurons. These results suggest that the seizure-induced loss of a basket cell-activating system, rather than a loss of inhibitory basket cells themselves, may cause disinhibition and thereby play a role in the pathophysiology and pathology of the epileptic state.",

In the piriform cortex, which is one of the most seizurogenic regions of the brain, CRF normally dampens excitability. By contrast, CRF increased the excitability of the piriform cortex in rats subjected to kindling, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In nonkindled rats, CRF activates its receptor, a G protein (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate-binding protein)-coupled receptor, and signals through a G$\alpha$q/11-mediated pathway. After seizure induction, CRF signaling occurred through a pathway involving G$\alpha$s This change in signaling was associated with reduced abundance of regulator of G protein signaling protein type 2 (RGS2), which has been reported to inhibit G$\alpha$s-dependent signaling. RGS2 knockout mice responded to CRF in a similar manner as epileptic rats.

abstract = "Cardiorespiratory collapse after a seizure is the leading cause of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in young persons, but why only certain individuals are at risk is unknown. To identify a mechanism for this lethal cardiorespiratory failure, we examined whether genes linked to increased SUDEP risk lower the threshold for spreading depolarization (SD), a self-propagating depolarizing wave that silences neuronal networks. Mice carrying mutations in Kv1.1 potassium channels (-/-) and Scn1a sodium ion channels (+/R1407X) phenocopy many aspects of human SUDEP. In mutant, but not wild-type mice, seizures initiated by topical application of 4-aminopyridine to the cortex led to a slow, negative DC potential shift recorded in the dorsal medulla, a brainstem region that controls cardiorespiratory pacemaking. This irreversible event slowly depolarized cells and inactivated synaptic activity, producing cardiorespiratory arrest. Local initiation of SD in this region by potassium chloride microinjection also elicited electroencephalographic suppression, apnea, bradycardia, and asystole, similar to the events seen in monitored human SUDEP. In vitro study of brainstem slices confirmed that mutant mice had a lower threshold for SD elicited by metabolic substrate depletion and that immature mice were at greater risk than adults. Deletion of the gene encoding tau, which prolongs life in these mutants, also restored the normal SD threshold in Kv1.1-mutant mouse brainstem. Thus, brainstem SD may be a critical threshold event linking seizures and SUDEP.",

However, global genetic reduction of TAU is beneficial also in models of other brain disorders that lack such TAU pathology, suggesting a pathogenic role of nonaggregated TAU. Here, conditional ablation of TAU in excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons reduced epilepsy, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, overactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, brain overgrowth (megalencephaly), and autism-like behaviors in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome, a severe epileptic encephalopathy of early childhood. Furthermore, treatment with a TAU-lowering antisense oligonucleotide, initiated on postnatal day 10, had similar therapeutic effects in this mouse model. Our findings suggest that excitatory neurons are the critical cell type in which TAU has to be reduced to counteract brain dysfunctions associated with Dravet syndrome and that overall cerebral TAU reduction could have similar benefits, even when initiated postnatally.",

abstract = "AIMS: To describe a large series of children with anoxic-epileptic seizures (AES)--that is, epileptic seizures induced by syncopes. METHODS: Retrospective case-note review in a tertiary paediatric neurology unit. For all 27 children seen with a definite diagnosis of AES between 1972 and 2002, a review of clinical histories, videotapes, and EEG/ECG studies was undertaken. Main outcome measures were: age of onset, frequency and type of syncopes; age of onset and frequency of AES; type and duration of induced epileptic seizures; effect of treatment of syncopal and epileptic components. RESULTS: Median age of onset of syncopes was 8 months (range 0.2-120), frequency 2 in total to 40/day, median total approximately 200. Syncopes were predominantly reflex asystolic (RAS), prolonged expiratory apnoea (cyanotic breath-holding spells), or of mixed or uncertain origin; there was one each of ear piercing and hair grooming vasovagal syncope and one of compulsive Valsalva. Median age of onset of AES was 17 months (range 7-120), frequency from total 1 to 3/day, median total 3. The epileptic component was almost always bilateral clonic; three had additional epilepsy, one each with complex partial seizures, myoclonic absences, and febrile seizures plus. Median duration of epileptic component was 5 minutes (range 0.5-40, mean 11). Cardiac pacing prevented RAS in two patients: most other anti-syncope therapies were ineffective. Diazepam terminated the epileptic component in 6/8. Valproate or carbamazepine abolished AES in 5/7 without influencing syncope frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon compared with simple syncopes, syncope triggered epileptic seizures (AES) are an important treatable basis of status epilepticus.",

abstract = "The mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway has multiple roles in regulating physiology of the whole body and, particularly, the brain. Deregulation of mTOR signalling has been associated to various neurological conditions, including epilepsy. Mutations in genes encoding components of Gap Activity TOward Rags 1 (GATOR1) (DEPDC5, NPRL2 and NPRL3), a complex involved in the inhibition of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), have been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of focal epilepsies (FEs), both lesional and non-lesional. The involvement of DEPDC5, NPRL2 and NRPL3 in about 10\% of FEs is in contrast to the concept that specific seizure semiology points to the main involvement of a distinct brain area. The hypothesised pathogenic mechanism underlying epilepsy is the loss of the inhibitory function of GATOR1 towards mTORC1. The identification of the correct therapeutic strategy in patients with FE is challenging, especially in those with refractory epilepsy and/or malformations of cortical development (MCDs). In such cases, surgical excision of the epileptogenic zone is a curative option, although the long-term outcome is still undefined. The GATOR1/mTOR signalling represents a promising therapeutic target in FEs due to mutations in mTOR pathway genes, as in tuberous sclerosis complex, another MCD-associated epilepsy caused by mTOR signalling hyperactivation.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesised that seizure induced neuronal loss and axonal damage in medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) may lead to the development of aberrant connections between limbic structures and eventually result in the reorganisation of the limbic network. In this study, limbic structural connectivity in patients with MTLE was investigated, using diffusion tensor MRI, probabilistic tractography and graph theory based network analysis. METHODS: 12 patients with unilateral MTLE and hippocampal sclerosis (five left and seven right MTLE) and 26 healthy controls were studied. The connectivity of 10 bilateral limbic regions of interest was mapped with probabilistic tractography, and the probabilistic fibre density between each pair of regions was used as the measure of their weighted structural connectivity. Binary connectivity matrices were then obtained from the weighted connectivity matrix using a range of fixed density thresholds. Graph theory based properties of nodes (degree, local efficiency, clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality) and the network (global efficiency and average clustering coefficient) were calculated from the weight and binary connectivity matrices of each subject and compared between patients and controls. RESULTS: MTLE was associated with a regional reduction in fibre density compared with controls. Paradoxically, patients exhibited (1) increased limbic network clustering and (2) increased nodal efficiency, degree and clustering coefficient in the ipsilateral insula, superior temporal region and thalamus. There was also a significant reduction in clustering coefficient and efficiency of the ipsilateral hippocampus, accompanied by increased nodal degree. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MTLE is associated with reorganisation of the limbic system. These results corroborate the concept of MTLE as a network disease, and may contribute to the understanding of network excitability dynamics in epilepsy and MTLE.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) disturb brain networks and lead to connectivity disturbances. We previously hypothesised that recurrent seizures in TLE may lead to abnormal connections involving subcortical activating structures including the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), contributing to neocortical dysfunction and neurocognitive impairments. However, no studies of ARAS connectivity have been previously reported in patients with epilepsy. METHODS: We used resting-state functional MRI recordings in 27 patients with TLE (67\% right sided) and 27 matched controls to examine functional connectivity (partial correlation) between eight brainstem ARAS structures and 105 cortical/subcortical regions. ARAS nuclei included: cuneiform/subcuneiform, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, median raphe, parabrachial complex, pontine oralis, pedunculopontine and ventral tegmental area. Connectivity patterns were related to disease and neuropsychological parameters. RESULTS: In control subjects, regions showing highest connectivity to ARAS structures included limbic structures, thalamus and certain neocortical areas, which is consistent with prior studies of ARAS projections. Overall, ARAS connectivity was significantly lower in patients with TLE than controls (p<0.05, paired t-test), particularly to neocortical regions including insular, lateral frontal, posterior temporal and opercular cortex. Diminished ARAS connectivity to these regions was related to increased frequency of consciousness-impairing seizures (p<0.01, Pearson's correlation) and was associated with impairments in verbal IQ, attention, executive function, language and visuospatial memory on neuropsychological evaluation (p<0.05, Spearman's rho or Kendell's tau-b). CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent seizures in TLE are associated with disturbances in ARAS connectivity, which are part of the widespread network dysfunction that may be related to neurocognitive problems in this devastating disorder.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a leading cause of epilepsy-related mortality in young adults. It has been suggested that SUDEP may kill over 20 000 people with epilepsy in China yearly. The aetiology of SUDEP is unclear. Little is known about candidate genes for SUDEP in people of Chinese origin as most studies have ascertained this in Caucasians. No candidate genes for SUDEP in Chinese people have been identified. METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in DNA samples collected from five incident cases of SUDEP identified in a large epilepsy cohort in rural China. We filtered rare variants identified from these cases as well as screened for SUDEP, epilepsy, heart disease or respiratory disease-related genes from previous published reports and compared them with publicly available data, living epilepsy controls and ethnicity-match non-epilepsy controls, to identify potential candidate genes for SUDEP. RESULTS: After the filtering process, the five cases carried 168 qualified mutations in 167 genes. Among these genetic anomalies, we identified rare variants in SCN5A (1/5:20\% in our cases), KIF6 (1/5:20\% in our cases) and TBX18 (1/5:20\% in our cases) which were absent in 330 living epilepsy control alleles from the same original cohort and 320 ethnicity-match non-epilepsy control alleles.

Accordingly, these malformations are characterized by abnormal cortical lamination cause by migrational defects, abnormal cytoarchitecture (e.g., cytomegaly), abnormal cellular polarity and the retention of an immature cellular phenotype throughout CNS development. As recurrent intractable seizures are a common feature of FCD, epileptogenic electrophysiological properties are also observed in addition to CNS inflammation.

We investigated the effects of AIH and acute intermittent optogenetic (AIO) stimulation of neurons labeled with AAV-CaMKIIa, hChR2(H134R), and mCherry in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of anesthetized, vagotomized, and mechanically ventilated rats. We measured renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), phrenic nerve activity (PNA), power spectral density, and coherence, and we made cross-correlation measurements to determine how AIO stimulation and AIH affected synchronization between PNA and RSNA. Sixty minutes after AIH produced by ventilation with 10\% oxygen in balanced nitrogen, RSNA and PNA amplitude increased by 80\% and by 130\%, respectively (P < 0.01). Sixty minutes after AIO stimulation, RSNA and PNA amplitude increased by 60\% and 100\%, respectively, (P < 0.01). These results suggest that acute intermittent stimulation of NTS neurons can induce renal sympathetic and phrenic LTF in the absence of hypoxia or chemoreceptor afferent activation. We also found that while acute intermittent optogenetic and hypoxic stimulations increased respiration-related RSNA modulation (P < 0.01), they did not increase synchronization between central respiratory drive and RSNA. We conclude that mechanisms that induce LTF originate within the caudal NTS and extend to other interconnecting neuronal elements of the central nervous cardiorespiratory network.",

abstract = "Although the reciprocal projections between the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the gustatory parabrachial nuclei (PbN) have been demonstrated neuroanatomically, there is no direct evidence showing that the projections from the PbN to the BNST carry taste information or that descending inputs from the BNST to the PbN modulate the activity of PbN gustatory neurons. A recent electrophysiological study has demonstrated that the BNST exerts modulatory influence on taste neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST), suggesting that the BNST may also modulate the activity of taste neurons in the PbN. In the present study, we recorded from 117 taste-responsive neurons in the PbN and examined their responsiveness to electrical stimulation of the BNST bilaterally. Thirteen neurons (11.1\%) were antidromically invaded from the BNST, mostly from the ipsilateral side (12 cells), indicating that a subset of taste neurons in the PbN project their axons to the BNST. The BNST stimulation induced orthodromic responses on most of the PbN neurons: 115 out of 117 (98.3\%), including all BNST projection units. This descending modulation on the PbN gustatory neurons was exclusively inhibitory. We also confirmed that activation of this efferent inhibitory projection from the BNST reduces taste responses of PbN neurons in all units tested. The BNST is part of the neural circuits that involve stress-associated feeding behavior. It is also known that brain stem gustatory nuclei, including the PbN, are associated with feeding behavior. Therefore, this neural substrate may be important in the stress-elicited alteration in ingestive behavior.",

author = "Purnell, Benton S and Buchanan, Gordon F",
abstract = "It is widely agreed that breathing is subject to circadian regulation. Circadian differences in respiratory physiology significantly impact a number of diseases including sleep apnea, asthma, and seizure-induced death. The effect of time of day on breathing has been previously characterized; however, an endogenous free-running respiratory rhythm in mammals has not previously been described. Furthermore, it is assumed that circadian rhythms in breathing are dependent on the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the home of the mammalian central circadian oscillator, but this has not been shown experimentally. The breathing of mice was monitored during wakefulness using whole body plethysmography at six times of day while housed under light-dark conditions and at six circadian phases while housed under constant darkness. Respiratory frequency and minute ventilation, but not tidal volume, were significantly higher during the active phase in both entrained and free-running conditions. To determine whether circadian regulation of breathing requires the SCN, in separate sets of animals this structure was electrolytically lesioned bilaterally or a sham surgery was performed, and breathing was measured at six different time points. Time-dependent oscillations in breathing were lost in SCN-lesioned animals, but not those subjected to sham surgery. These results suggest that breathing is subject to circadian regulation via the SCN. Mechanistic insights into the circadian regulation of breathing may lead to targeted interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with diseases with respiratory pathophysiology.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY It has long been appreciated that breathing is altered by time of day. This study demonstrates that rhythmicity in breathing persists in constant darkness but is dependent on the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. Understanding circadian rhythms in breathing may be important for the treatment and prevention of diseases such as sleep apnea and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.",

Understanding why SUDEP occurs at night during sleep might help to better understand why SUDEP occurs at all and hasten development of preventive strategies. Here we aimed to understand circumstances causing seizures that occur during sleep to result in death. Groups of 12 adult male mice were instrumented for EEG, EMG, and EKG recording and subjected to seizure induction via maximal electroshock (MES) during wakefulness, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Seizure inductions were performed with concomitant EEG, EMG, and EKG recording and breathing assessment via whole body plethysmography. Seizures induced via MES during sleep were associated with more profound respiratory suppression and were more likely to result in death. Despite REM sleep being a time when seizures do not typically occur spontaneously, when seizures were forced to occur during REM sleep, they were invariably fatal in this model. An examination of baseline breathing revealed that mice that died following a seizure had increased baseline respiratory rate variability compared with those that did not die. These data demonstrate that sleep, especially REM sleep, can be a dangerous time for a seizure to occur. These data also demonstrate that there may be baseline respiratory abnormalities that can predict which individuals have higher risk for seizure-induced death.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in refractory epilepsy patients. Although specific mechanisms underlying SUDEP are not well understood, evidence suggests most SUDEP occurs due to seizure-induced respiratory arrest. SUDEP also tends to happen at night. Although this may be due to circumstances in which humans find themselves at night, such as being alone without supervision or sleeping prone, or to independent influences of sleep state, there are a number of reasons why the night (i.e., circadian influences) could be an independent risk factor for SUDEP. We explored this possibility. Adult male WT mice were instrumented for EEG, EMG, and EKG recording and subjected to maximal electroshock (MES) seizures during wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the nighttime/dark phase. These data were compared with data collected following seizures induced during the daytime/light phase. Seizures induced during the nighttime were similar in severity and duration to those induced during the daytime; however, seizures induced during the nighttime were associated with a lesser degree of respiratory dysregulation and postictal EEG suppression. Seizures induced during REM sleep during the nighttime were universally fatal, as is seen when seizures are induced during REM during the daytime. Taken together, these data implicate a role for time of day in influencing the physiological consequences of seizures that may contribute to seizure-induced death.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. SUDEP frequently occurs during the night, which has been attributed to an effect of sleep. We have shown that sleep state does indeed influence survival following a seizure. That SUDEP occurs during the night could also implicate a circadian influence. In this study we found that time of day independently affects the physiological consequences of seizures.",

abstract = "Previously, it was reported that various cortical and subcortical structures display high-frequency local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the 110- to 160-Hz range (HFOs), distinct from sharp-wave ripples. In the present study, we characterize HFOs in the extended amygdala. Rats were implanted with tetrode bundles in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala (CeA), as well as adjacent regions (pallidum, caudate-putamen, and lateral septum). At all recorded sites, HFO power showed a systematic dependence on behavioral state: highest during quiet wakefulness, intermediate during paradoxical sleep, and lowest during active waking or slow-wave sleep. CO2 asphyxiation as well as anesthesia with isoflurane or urethane abolished HFOs. HFOs stood out relative to all other fast-frequency LFP components because they were highly coherent between distant sites of the extended amygdala, ipsi- and contralaterally. HFOs affected neuronal firing in two ways: firing rate could vary as a function of HFO power (rate modulation) or HFOs could entrain firing on a cycle-to-cycle basis (phase modulation). The incidence of phase-modulated neurons was about twice higher in BNST and CeA (20-40\%) than in adjacent regions ($\leq$8\%). Among BNST and CeA neurons, many more were phase-modulated than rate-modulated, although about half of the latter were also phase-modulated. Overall, these results indicate that HFOs entrain the activity of a high proportion of neurons in the extended amygdala. A major challenge for future studies will be to identify the mechanisms supporting the high coherence of HFOs within and across hemispheres.",

abstract = "Hundreds of mutations in the SCN1A sodium channel gene confer a wide spectrum of epileptic disorders, requiring efficient model systems to study cellular mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets. We recently demonstrated that Drosophila knock-in flies carrying the K1270T SCN1A mutation known to cause a form of genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) exhibit a heat-induced increase in sodium current activity and seizure phenotype. To determine whether different SCN1A mutations cause distinct phenotypes in Drosophila as they do in humans, this study focuses on a knock-in line carrying a mutation that causes a more severe seizure disorder termed Dravet syndrome (DS). Introduction of the DS SCN1A mutation (S1231R) into the Drosophila sodium channel gene para results in flies that exhibit spontaneous and heat-induced seizures with distinct characteristics and lower onset temperature than the GEFS+ flies. Electrophysiological studies of GABAergic interneurons in the brains of adult DS flies reveal, for the first time in an in vivo model system, that a missense DS mutation causes a constitutive and conditional reduction in sodium current activity and repetitive firing. In addition, feeding with the serotonin precursor 5-HTP suppresses heat-induced seizures in DS but not GEFS+ flies. The distinct alterations of sodium currents in DS and GEFS+ GABAergic interneurons demonstrate that both loss- and gain-of-function alterations in sodium currents are capable of causing reduced repetitive firing and seizure phenotypes. The mutation-specific effects of 5-HTP on heat-induced seizures suggest the serotonin pathway as a potential therapeutic target for DS.",

abstract = "Brain damage causes multiple changes in synaptic function and intrinsic properties of surviving neurons, leading to the development of chronic epilepsy. In the widely used pilocarpine-status epilepticus (SE) rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a major alteration is the marked increase in the fraction of intrinsically bursting CA1 pyramidal cells. Here we have differentiated between two types of bursting phenotypes: 1) bursting in response to threshold-straddling excitatory current pulses (low-threshold bursting) and 2) bursting only in response to suprathreshold stimuli (high-threshold bursting). Low-threshold bursting prevailed in 46.5\% of SE-experienced neurons sampled 1-4 wk after pilocarpine-SE, but was rarely seen in control neurons (1.9\%). As previously shown, it appeared to be driven predominantly by a T-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaT)) in the apical dendrites. After blocking low-threshold bursting with Ni(2+), the same neurons still manifested a high-threshold bursting phenotype. Another 40.1\% of SE-experienced neurons displayed only a high-threshold bursting phenotype and the remaining 13.4\% of these neurons were nonbursters. Altogether, high-threshold bursting prevailed in 86.6\% of SE-experienced neurons, but only in 33.0\% of control neurons. Several lines of evidence indicated that high-threshold bursting is driven by persistent Na(+) current (I(NaP)) at or near the soma. Congruently, I(NaP) was 1.5-fold larger in SE-experienced versus control neurons. We conclude that an increase in I(NaP), conjointly with an increase in I(CaT), strongly contributes to the predominance of bursting phenotypes in CA1 pyramidal cells early after pilocarpine-SE and thus likely plays a role in the development of a chronic epileptic condition in this TLE model.",

author = "Jacobs, K M and Prince, D A",
abstract = "Developmental cortical malformations are common in patients with intractable epilepsy; however, mechanisms contributing to this epileptogenesis are currently poorly understood. We previously characterized hyperexcitability in a rat model that mimics the histopathology of human 4-layered microgyria. Here we examined inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents in this model to identify functional alterations that might contribute to epileptogenesis associated with microgyria. We recorded isolated whole cell excitatory postsynaptic currents and GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) from layer V pyramidal neurons in the region previously shown to be epileptogenic (paramicrogyral area) and in homotopic control cortex. Epileptiform-like activity could be evoked in 60\% of paramicrogyral (PMG) cells by local stimulation. The peak conductance of both spontaneous and evoked IPSCs was significantly larger in all PMG cells compared with controls. This difference in amplitude was not present after blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic currents or for miniature (m)IPSCs, suggesting that it was due to the excitatory afferent activity driving inhibitory neurons. This conclusion was supported by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonist application resulted in a significantly greater reduction in spontaneous IPSC frequency in one PMG cell group (PMG(E)) compared with control cells. The frequency of both spontaneous and miniature EPSCs was significantly greater in all PMG cells, suggesting that pyramidal neurons adjacent to a microgyrus receive more excitatory input than do those in control cortex. These findings suggest that there is an increase in numbers of functional excitatory synapses on both interneurons and pyramidal cells in the PMG cortex perhaps due to hyperinnervation by cortical afferents originally destined for the microgyrus proper.",

abstract = "Recent experimental and modeling results demonstrated that surviving mossy cells in the dentate gyrus play key roles in the generation of network hyperexcitability. Here we examined if mossy cells exhibit long-term plasticity in the posttraumatic, hyperexcitable dentate gyrus. Mossy cells 1 wk after fluid percussion head injury did not show alterations in their current-firing frequency (I-F) and current-membrane voltage (I-V) relationships. In spite of the unchanged I-F and I-V curves, mossy cells showed extensive modifications in Na(+), K(+) and h-currents, indicating the coordinated nature of these opposing modifications. Computational experiments in a realistic large-scale model of the dentate gyrus demonstrated that individually, these perturbations could significantly affect network activity. Synaptic inputs also displayed systematic, opposing modifications. Miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes were decreased, whereas miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitudes were increased as expected from a homeostatic response to network hyperexcitability. In addition, opposing alterations in miniature and spontaneous synaptic event frequencies and amplitudes were observed for both EPSCs and IPSCs. Despite extensive changes in synaptic inputs, cannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition was not altered in posttraumatic mossy cells. These data demonstrate that many intrinsic and synaptic properties of mossy cells undergo highly specific, long-term alterations after traumatic brain injury. The systematic nature of such extensive and opposing alterations suggests that single-cell properties are significantly influenced by homeostatic mechanisms in hyperexcitable circuits.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is among the leading causes of death in people with epilepsy. Individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have a high risk for SUDEP because the seizures are often medically intractable. Neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) have been implicated in mouse models of SUDEP and play a critical role in modulating cardiorespiratory and autonomic output. Increased neuronal excitability of inhibitory, GABAergic neurons in the NTS develops during epileptogenesis and NTS dysfunction has been implicated in mouse models of SUDEP. In this study we used the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus model of TLE (i.e., pilo-SE mice) to investigate the A-type voltage-gated K+ channel as a potential contributor to increased excitability in GABAergic NTS neurons during epileptogenesis. Compared with age-matched controls, pilo-SE mice displayed an increase in spontaneous action potential frequency and half-width 9-12 weeks post-treatment. Activity of GABAergic NTS neurons from pilo-SE mice showed less sensitivity to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Correspondingly, reduced A-type K+ current amplitude was detected in these neurons, with no change in activation or inactivation kinetics. No changes were observed in Kv4.1, Kv4.2, Kv4.3, KChIP1, KChIP3, or KChIP4 mRNA expression. These changes contribute to the increased excitability in GABAergic NTS neurons that develops in TLE and may provide insight into potential mechanisms contributing to the increased risk for cardiorespiratory collapse and SUDEP in this model.",

abstract = "It was proposed that the central amygdala (CeA), particularly its medial sector (CeM) generates brief fear responses to discrete conditioned cues whereas the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) promotes long-lasting anxiety-like states in response to more diffuse contingencies. Although it is believed that BNST-CeA interactions determine the transition between short- and long-duration responses, the nature of these interactions remains unknown. To shed light on this question, we used a double viral strategy to drive the expression of Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in BNST cells that project to CeA. Next, using patch clamp recordings in vitro, we investigated the connectivity of infected cells to non-infected cells in BNST and compared the influence of BNST axons on neurons in the medial and lateral (CeL) parts of CeA. CeA-projecting BNST cells were concentrated in the anterolateral (AL) and anteroventral (AV) sectors of BNST. Dense plexuses of BNST axons were observed throughout CeA. In CeA and BNST, light-evoked EPSPs accounted for a minority of responses (0-9\% of tested cells); inhibition prevailed. The incidence of inhibitory responses was higher in CeM than in CeL (66 and 43\% of tested cells, respectively). Within BNST, the connections from CeA-projecting to non-CeA targeting cells varied as a function of the BNST sector: 50\% vs. 9\% of tested cells exhibited light-evoked responses in BNST-AL vs. BNST-AV, respectively. Overall, these results suggest that via its projection to CeA, BNST exerts an inhibitory influence over cued fear and that BNST neurons projecting to CeA form contrasting connections in different BNST subnuclei.",

abstract = "Mossy cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting are two characteristic consequences of repeated seizures and head trauma. However, their precise contributions to the hyperexcitable state are not well understood. Because it is difficult, and frequently impossible, to independently examine using experimental techniques whether it is the loss of mossy cells or the sprouting of mossy fibers that leads to dentate hyperexcitability, we built a biophysically realistic and anatomically representative computational model of the dentate gyrus to examine this question. The 527-cell model, containing granule, mossy, basket, and hilar cells with axonal projections to the perforant-path termination zone, showed that even weak mossy fiber sprouting (10--15\% of the strong sprouting observed in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy) resulted in the spread of seizure-like activity to the adjacent model hippocampal laminae after focal stimulation of the perforant path. The simulations also indicated that the spatially restricted, lamellar distribution of the sprouted mossy fiber contacts reported in in vivo studies was an important factor in sustaining seizure-like activity in the network. In contrast to the robust hyperexcitability-inducing effects of mossy fiber sprouting, removal of mossy cells resulted in decreased granule cell responses to perforant-path activation in agreement with recent experimental data. These results indicate the crucial role of mossy fiber sprouting even in situations where there is only relatively weak mossy fiber sprouting as is the case after moderate concussive experimental head injury.",

The activities of phrenic (PND), cervical vagus (cVNA), and thoracic sympathetic (tSNA) nerves were recorded before and after bilateral microinjections of kynurenic acid (Kyn, 5 nmol/20 nl) into iNTS, cNTS, or both simultaneously. In WHBP, baseline sympathetic discharge markedly correlated with phrenic bursts (inspiration). However, most of sympathoexcitation elicited by chemoreflex activation occurred during expiration. Kyn microinjected into iNTS or into cNTS decreased the postinspiratory component of cVNA and increased the duration and frequency of PND. Kyn into iNTS produced no changes in sympathoexcitatory and tachypneic responses to peripheral chemoreflex activation, whereas into cNTS, a reduction of the sympathoexcitation, but not of the tachypnea, was observed. The pattern of phrenic and sympathetic coupling during the chemoreflex activation was an inspiratory-related rather than an expiratory-related sympathoexcitation. Kyn simultaneously into iNTS and cNTS produced a greater decrease in postinspiratory component of cVNA and increase in frequency and duration of PND and abolished the respiratory and autonomic responses to chemoreflex activation. The data show that glutamatergic neurotransmission in the iNTS and cNTS plays a tonic role on the baseline respiratory rhythm, contributes to the postinspiratory activity, and is essential to expiratory-related sympathoexcitation observed during chemoreflex activation.",

The role of these channels in control of epileptiform discharges is less thoroughly understood. This is especially pertinent given the altered HCN channel expression in epilepsy. We hypothesized that inhibition of HCN channels would enhance bicuculline-induced epileptiform discharges. Whole cell recordings were obtained from layer (L)2/3 and L5 pyramidal neurons and L1 and L5 GABAergic interneurons. In the presence of bicuculline (10 $\mu$M), HCN channel inhibition with ZD 7288 (20 $\mu$M) significantly increased the magnitude (defined as area) of evoked epileptiform events in both L2/3 and L5 neurons. We recorded activity associated with epileptiform discharges in L1 and L5 interneurons to test the hypothesis that HCN channels regulate excitatory synaptic inputs differently in interneurons versus pyramidal neurons. HCN channel inhibition increased the magnitude of epileptiform events in both L1 and L5 interneurons. The increased magnitude of epileptiform events in both pyramidal cells and interneurons was due to an increase in network activity, since holding cells at depolarized potentials under voltage-clamp conditions to minimize HCN channel opening did not prevent enhancement in the presence of ZD 7288. In neurons recorded with ZD 7288-containing pipettes, bath application of the noninactivating inward cationic current (Ih) antagonist still produced increases in epileptiform responses. These results show that epileptiform discharges in disinhibited rat neocortex are modulated by HCN channels.",

abstract = "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a key role in fear-related learning and memory, in the modulation of cognitive functions, and in the overall regulation of emotional behavior. Pathophysiological alterations involving hyperexcitability in this brain region underlie anxiety and other emotional disorders, as well as some forms of epilepsy. GABAergic interneurons exert a tight inhibitory control over the BLA network; understanding the mechanisms that regulate their activity is necessary for understanding physiological and disordered BLA functions. The BLA receives dense cholinergic input from the basal forebrain, affecting both normal functions and dysfunctions of the amygdala, but the mechanisms involved in the cholinergic regulation of inhibitory activity in the BLA are unclear. Using whole-cell recordings in rat amygdala slices, here we demonstrate that the $\alpha$7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ($\alpha$7-nAChRs) are present on somatic or somatodendritic regions of BLA interneurons. These receptors are active in the basal state enhancing GABAergic inhibition, and their further - exogenous - activation produces a transient but dramatic increase of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in principal BLA neurons. In the absence of AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists, activation of $\alpha$7-nAChRs in the BLA network, increases both GABAergic and glutamatergic spontaneous currents in BLA principal cells, but the inhibitory currents are enhanced significantly more than the excitatory currents, reducing overall excitability. The anxiolytic effects of nicotine, as well as the role of the $\alpha$7-nAChRs in seizure activity involving the amygdala and in mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, may be better understood in light of the present findings.",

As individual neurons function within neural circuits, it is important to understand local microcircuits and larger network connections of identified neuronal types, and understand how maladaptive changes in the BNST neural networks are induced by stress and drug use. However, due to limitations of classic anatomical and physiological methods, local circuit organization of synaptic input to specific BNST neuron types is not well understood. In this study, we report on our application of high-resolution and cell-type specific photostimulation methodology developed in our laboratory to local circuit mapping in the BNST. Under calibrated experimental conditions, laser photostimulation via glutamate uncaging or channelrhodopsin-2 photoactivation evokes spiking of BNST neurons perisomatically, without activating spikes from axons of passage or distal dendrites. Whole cell recordings combined with spatially restricted photostimulation of presynaptic neurons at many different locations over a large region allow high resolution mapping of presynaptic input sources to single recorded neurons in the BNST. We constructed maps of synaptic inputs impinging onto corticotrophin releasing hormone-expressing (CRH+) BNST neurons in the dorsolateral BNST, and found that the CRH+ neurons receive predominant local inhibitory synaptic connections with very weak excitatory connections. Through cell-type specific optogenetic stimulation mapping, we generated maps of somatostatin-expressing-neuron specific inhibitory inputs to BNST neurons. Taken together, the photostimulation-based techniques offer us powerful tools for determining the functional organization of local circuits of specific BNST neuron types.",

author = "Bower, Mark R and Buckmaster, Paul S",
abstract = "Although much is known about persistent molecular, cellular, and circuit changes associated with temporal lobe epilepsy, mechanisms of seizure onset remain unclear. The dentate gyrus displays many persistent epilepsy-related abnormalities and is in the mesial temporal lobe where seizures initiate in patients. However, little is known about seizure-related activity of individual neurons in the dentate gyrus. We used tetrodes to record action potentials of multiple, single granule cells before and during spontaneous seizures in epileptic pilocarpine-treated rats. Subsets of granule cells displayed four distinct activity patterns: increased firing before seizure onset, decreased firing before seizure onset, increased firing only after seizure onset, and unchanged firing rates despite electrographic seizure activity in the immediate vicinity. No cells decreased firing rate immediately after seizure onset. During baseline periods between seizures, action potential waveforms and firing rates were similar among the four subsets of granule cells in epileptic rats and in granule cells of control rats. The mean normalized firing rate of granule cells whose firing rates increased before seizure onset deviated from baseline earliest, beginning 4 min before dentate gyrus electrographic seizure onset, and increased progressively, more than doubling by seizure onset. It is generally assumed that neuronal firing rates increase abruptly and synchronously only when electrographic seizures begin. However, these findings show heterogeneous and gradually building changes in activity of individual granule cells minutes before spontaneous seizures.",

To investigate EI interactions during seizure-like events (SLEs), we performed simultaneous dual and triple whole cell and extracellular recordings in pyramidal cells and oriens interneurons in rat hippocampal CA1. We describe a novel pattern of interleaving EI activity during spontaneous in vitro SLEs generated by the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine in the presence of decreased magnesium. Interneuron activity was increased during interictal periods. During ictal discharges interneurons entered into long-lasting depolarization block (DB) with suppression of spike generation; simultaneously, pyramidal cells produced spike trains with increased frequency (6-14 Hz) and correlation. After this period of runaway excitation, interneuron postictal spiking resumed and pyramidal cells became progressively quiescent. We performed correlation measures of cell-pair interactions using either the spikes alone or the subthreshold postsynaptic interspike signals. EE spike correlation was notably increased during interneuron DB, whereas subthreshold EE correlation decreased. EI spike correlations increased at the end of SLEs, whereas II subthreshold correlations increased during DB.

abstract = "The brain maintains a homeostatic condition in the body through neuronal communication with peripheral organs. The immune system is also regulated by the nervous system with principles of reflex regulation. Neuronal pathways, including the vagus nerve-based inflammatory reflex, are physiological regulators of immune function and inflammation. However, it remains unclear whether and how the brain encodes the state of the immune system. We previously showed that the projections from the brainstem dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve control inflammatory responses in the spleen. Furthermore, we found that cytokine-specific information is present in sensory neural signals within the vagus nerve. Based on these findings, we reasoned that the brain encodes and stores cytokine-specific information. In this study, we first investigated physiological parameters and serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) that are induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1? (IL-1?). Increased serum levels of IL-6 and MCP-1 are observed after TNF and IL-1? administration. Interestingly, we found that IL-1?, but not TNF administration induces tachycardia. These results suggest activation of specific neural populations in the brain by TNF or IL-1?. Next, we carried out activity-dependent cell labeling in mice. We utilized the targeted-recombination-in-active-populations (TRAP2) mice crossed with a tdTomato reporter line to produce double transgenic TRAP2/tdTomato mice. Administration of TNF or IL-1? induces activation of neurons (expressing tdTomato indicative of neuronal activity) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), where vagal afferents ascending from peripheral tissues synapse on neurons. Re-exposure of mice to either TNF or IL-1? results in the labeling of additional neuronal populations in the BNST. A significant population of TNF-responsive neurons are found to be localized in the protein kinase C delta (PKC?)-positive subnucleus within the BNST, while IL-1?-responsive tdTomato marked neurons are predominantly located in the PKC?-negative region within the BNST. Together, these studies suggest that the brain encodes TNF and IL-1?-specific information in specific neuronal population.

abstract = "GABAB receptors are broadly expressed in the nervous system and have been implicated in a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The cloning of the first GABAB receptor cDNAs in 1997 revived interest in these receptors and their potential as therapeutic targets. With the availability of molecular tools, rapid progress was made in our understanding of the GABAB system. This led to the surprising discovery that GABAB receptors need to assemble from distinct subunits to function and provided exciting new insights into the structure of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in general. As a consequence of this discovery, it is now widely accepted that GPCRs can exist as heterodimers. The cloning of GABAB receptors allowed some important questions in the field to be answered. It is now clear that molecular studies do not support the existence of pharmacologically distinct GABAB receptors, as predicted by work on native receptors. Advances were also made in clarifying the relationship between GABAB receptors and the receptors for gamma-hydroxybutyrate, an emerging drug of abuse. There are now the first indications linking GABAB receptor polymorphisms to epilepsy. Significantly, the cloning of GABAB receptors enabled identification of the first allosteric GABAB receptor compounds, which is expected to broaden the spectrum of therapeutic applications. Here we review current concepts on the molecular composition and function of GABAB receptors and discuss ongoing drug-discovery efforts.",

Little is known about the epidemiology of TLE, because it requires advanced neuroimaging, positive EEG, and appropriate clinical semiology to confirm the diagnosis. Moreover, recently recognized incidentally detected mesial temporal sclerosis in otherwise healthy individuals and benign temporal epilepsy indicate that the true epidemiology of TLE is underestimated. Our current knowledge on the epidemiology of TLE derives from data published from tertiary referral centers and/or inferred from population-based studies dealing with epilepsy.

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the commonest form of focal epilepsy and represents almost 2/3 of cases of intractable epilepsy managed surgically. A history of febrile seizures (especially complex febrile seizures) is common in TLE and is frequently associated with mesial temporal sclerosis (the commonest form of TLE). Seizure auras occur in many TLE patients and often exhibit features that are relatively specific for TLE but few are of lateralizing value. Automatisms, however, often have lateralizing significance. Careful study of seizure semiology remains invaluable in addressing the search for the seizure onset zone.",

The study was conducted in 30 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (19 with left hippocampal sclerosis, 11 with right hippocampal sclerosis). All subjects underwent four tests of cardiac autonomic function: heart rate changes in response to deep breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure variations throughout resting activity and during hand grip, mental stress, and orthostatic tests. Our results show that the right cerebral hemisphere predominantly modulates sympathetic activity, while the left cerebral hemisphere mainly modulates parasympathetic activity, which mediated tachycardia and excessive bradycardia counterregulation, both of which might be involved as a mechanism of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP).",

Long-term plasticity of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission occurs in a concerted manner, finely adjusting the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance.

Several evidences have demonstrated that astrocytes are able to control the synaptic plasticity, with astrocytes being active partners in synaptic physiology and E/I balance. Here, we revise molecular evidences showing the epileptic stage as an abnormal form of long-term brain plasticity and propose the possible participation of astrocytes to the abnormal increase of glutamatergic and decrease of GABAergic neurotransmission in epileptic networks.",

Lemongrass, lavender, clove, dill, and other EOs containing constituents such as asarone, carvone, citral, eugenol, or linalool are good candidates for evaluation as antiepileptic drugs. On the other hand, some EOs have convulsant effects and may trigger seizures in both epileptic and healthy individuals. Internal use of EOs like sage, hyssop, rosemary, camphor, pennyroyal, eucalyptus, cedar, thuja, and fennel can cause epileptic seizures because they contain thujone, 1,8-cineole, camphor, or pinocamphone, which have been identified as convulsive agents. While more research is needed to confirm their mechanisms of action, it appears that the convulsant or anticonvulsant properties of essential oils are largely due to (1) their ability to modulate the GABAergic system of neurotransmission and (2) their capacity to alter ionic currents through ion channels.

The aim of this study was to determine the CB immunoreactivity in hippocampal dentate gyrus of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for drug-resistant TLE with and without comorbid depression and/or memory deficits. Methods: Selected hippocampal samples from patients with TLE who underwent epilepsy surgery were included. Clinical and complementary assessment: EEG, video-EEG, MRI, psychiatric assessment (structured clinical interview, DSM-IV), and memory assessment (Rey auditory verbal learning test, RAVLT; Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, RCFT), were determined before surgery. Hippocampal sections were processed using immunoperoxidase with the anti-calbindin antibody. The semiquantitative analysis of CB immunoreactivity was determined in dentate gyrus by computerized image analysis (ImageJ). Results: Hippocampal sections of patients with TLE and HS (n = 24) and postmortem controls (n = 5) were included. A significant reduction of CB+ cells was found in patients with TLE (p < 0.05, Student's t-test). Among TLE cases (n = 24), depression (n = 12) and memory deficit (n = 17) were determined. Depression was associated with a higher \% of cells with the CB dendritic expression (CB-sprouted cells) (F(1, 20) = 11.81, p = 0.003, hp2 = 0.37), a higher CB+ area ($\mu$m2) (F(1, 20) = 5.33, p = 0.032, hp2 = 0.21), and a higher optical density (F(1, 20) = 15.09, p = 0.001, hp2 = 0.43) (two-way ANOVA). The GAF scale (general assessment of functioning) of DSM-IV inversely correlated with the \% of CB-sprouted cells (r = -0.52, p = 0.008) and with the CB+ area (r = -0.46, p = 0.022). Conclusions: In this exploratory study, comorbid depression was associated with a differential pattern of CB cell loss in dentate gyrus combined with a higher CB sprouting. These changes may indicate granular cell dysmaturation associated to the epileptic hyperexcitability phenomena. Further investigations should be carried out to confirm these preliminary findings.",

Nerve electrical stimulation is considered to be a very effective method for treating epilepsy with anxiety and depression. There are many traditional methods for the treatment of epilepsy. For example, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been applied earlier, and the therapeutic effect has been confirmed, but it will cause serious complications and is easier to be uncomfortable; deep brain stimulation for epilepsy is still in the immature stage, and there is no final conclusion. Therefore, this article proposes a clinical study on the treatment of patients with epilepsy with anxiety and depression based on the electronic medical nerve stimulation of the Internet of Things. First of all, this article uses the literature method to study the causes of epilepsy and previous treatment methods. Then, we designed an experimental study of epilepsy with depression based on the Internet of Things electronic medical neuroelectric stimulation therapy and selected the core quality of life questionnaire, SDS, and SAS as observation indicators. Finally, the comparison of epilepsy symptoms and depression and anxiety between the control group and the observation group before and after treatment was analyzed. The results of the experiment showed that, among the 50 subjects in the study, the observation group that used electrical nerve stimulation therapy had 5 people who stopped seizures after treatment, accounting for 10\%, while in the control group of traditional drug treatment methods, after treatment, only one person stopped the seizure, accounting for 2\%. In addition, the SAS and SDS scores of the observation group were also lower than those of the control group. Therefore, the use of nerve electrical stimulation to treat epilepsy with anxiety and depression symptoms has better performance and can help patients recover as soon as possible.",

To better understand how Pten regulates the excitability of principal forebrain neurons, a factor that is likely to be altered in cognitive disorders, epilepsy and autism, we generated a novel conditional knockout mouse line (NEX-Pten) in which Cre, under the control of the NEX promoter, drives the deletion of Pten specifically in early postmitotic, excitatory neurons of the developing forebrain. Homozygous mutant mice exhibited a massive enlargement of the forebrain, and died shortly after birth due to excessive mTOR activation. Analysis of the neonatal cerebral cortex further identified molecular defects resulting from Pten deletion that likely affect several aspects of neuronal development and excitability.",

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Mental health comorbidities such as depression and anxiety are common in epilepsy, especially among people with pharmacoresistant epilepsy who are candidates for epilepsy surgery. The Psychology Task Force of the International League Against Epilepsy advised that psychological interventions should be integrated into comprehensive epilepsy care. METHODS: To better understand the psychological impact of epilepsy and epileptic seizures in epilepsy surgery candidates, we analysed interviews with this subgroup of patients using Karl Jaspers' concept of limit situations, which are characterised by a confrontation with the limits and challenges of life. These are especially chance, randomness, and unpredictability, death and finitude of life, struggle and self-assertion, guilt, failure, and falling short of one's aspirations. RESULTS: In 43 interviews conducted with 15 people with drug-resistant epilepsy who were candidates for epilepsy surgery, we found that these themes are recurrent and have a large psychosocial impact, which can result in depression and anxiety. For some people, epileptic seizures appear to meet the criteria for traumatic events. CONCLUSION: Understanding epilepsy and seizures as existential challenges complements the neurobiological explanations for psychological comorbidities and can help tailor psychological interventions to the specific needs of people with epilepsy, especially those who are candidates for surgical treatment.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation on the ECG often lead to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. The mechanism causing a prolongation of the QT interval during epilepsy remains unknown. Based on observations showing an upregulation of neuronal sodium channels in the brain during epilepsy, we tested the hypothesis that a similar phenomenon occurs in the heart and contributes to QT prolongation by altering cardiac sodium current properties (INa). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the patch clamp technique to assess the effects of epilepsy on the cardiac action potential and INa in rat ventricular myocytes. Consistent with QT prolongation, epileptic rats had longer ventricular action potential durations attributable to a sustained component of INa (INaL). The increase in INaL was because of a larger contribution of neuronal Na channels characterized by their high sensitivity to tetrodotoxin. As in the brain, epilepsy was associated with an enhanced expression of the neuronal isoform NaV1.1 in cardiomyocyte. Epilepsy was also associated with a lower INa activation threshold resulting in increased cell excitability. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study correlating increased expression of neuronal sodium channels within the heart to epilepsy-related cardiac arrhythmias. This represents a new paradigm in our understanding of cardiac complications related to epilepsy.",

abstract = "Highly influential models have proposed that responses to different types of threat are mediated by partially segregated neural systems, with the amygdala underlying phasic responses to explicit threat (fear) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediating sustained responses to ambiguous threat (anxiety). However, newer models have suggested similar recruitment of both regions across a wide spectrum of threat. Therefore, to empirically test these models and further elucidate the activation profiles and connectivity patterns of the amygdala and the BNST during threat processing, 20 participants were scanned using high-resolution fMRI (1.5 mm3). Using fearful faces and human screams as aversive stimuli, two threat conditions were created: Explicit Threat in which threats were certain and predictable (fear) and Ambiguous Threat in which threats were uncertain and unpredictable (anxiety). Results indicated that, although the amygdala and the BNST both showed heightened engagement across both threat conditions, the amygdala showed preferential engagement during Explicit Threat and displayed functional connectivity with regions involved in stimulus processing and motor response. By contrast, the BNST preferentially responded during Ambiguous Threat and exhibited functional connectivity with prefrontal regions underlying interoception and rumination. Furthermore, correlations with questionnaires measuring trait anxiety, worry, and rumination suggested that individual differences in affective style play a modulatory role in regional recruitment and network connectivity during threat processing.",

Levels of these tRNA fragments were higher in pre-seizure than post-seizure samples, suggesting they may serve as biomarkers of seizure risk in epilepsy patients. In vitro studies confirmed that production and extracellular release of tRNA fragments was lower after epileptiform-like activity in hippocampal neurons. We designed PCR-based assays to quantify tRNA fragments in a cohort of pre- and post-seizure plasma samples from focal epilepsy patients and healthy controls (n = 32/group). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that tRNA fragments potently distinguished pre- from post-seizure patients (area under the curve of 0.8-0.95). Elevated tRNA fragments levels were not detected in patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, and did not result from medication tapering. This study identifies a novel class of epilepsy biomarker and reveals the potential existence of prodromal molecular patterns in blood that could be used to predict seizure risk.",

Dravet syndrome (DS) is an infantile-onset intractable epilepsy caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SCN1A gene, which encodes brain type-I voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.1. We studied the mechanism of premature death in Scn1a heterozygous KO mice and conditional brain- and cardiac-specific KOs. Video monitoring demonstrated that SUDEP occurred immediately following generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A history of multiple seizures was a strong risk factor for SUDEP. Combined video-electroencephalography-electrocardiography revealed suppressed interictal resting heart-rate variability and episodes of ictal bradycardia associated with the tonic phases of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Prolonged atropine-sensitive ictal bradycardia preceded SUDEP. Similar studies in conditional KO mice demonstrated that brain, but not cardiac, KO of Scn1a produced cardiac and SUDEP phenotypes similar to those found in DS mice. Atropine or N-methyl scopolamine treatment reduced the incidence of ictal bradycardia and SUDEP in DS mice. These findings suggest that SUDEP is caused by apparent parasympathetic hyperactivity immediately following tonic-clonic seizures in DS mice, which leads to lethal bradycardia and electrical dysfunction of the ventricle. These results have important implications for prevention of SUDEP in DS patients.",

Reductions in circulating leptin concentrations reflect a negative energy balance, which augments sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation in response to metabolically demanding emergencies. This process ensures adequate glucose mobilization despite low energy stores. We report that leptin receptor-expressing neurons (LepRb neurons) in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the largest population of LepRb neurons in the brain stem, mediate this process. Application of noxious stimuli, which often signal the need to mobilize glucose to support an appropriate response, activated PAG LepRb neurons, which project to and activate parabrachial nucleus (PBN) neurons that control SNS activation and glucose mobilization. Furthermore, activating PAG LepRb neurons increased SNS activity and blood glucose concentrations, while ablating LepRb in PAG neurons augmented glucose mobilization in response to noxious stimuli. Thus, decreased leptin action on PAG LepRb neurons augments the autonomic response to noxious stimuli, ensuring sufficient glucose mobilization during periods of acute demand in the face of diminished energy stores.",

Patients with DS have a high risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP), widely believed to be due to cardiac mechanisms. Here we show that patients with DS commonly have peri-ictal respiratory dysfunction. One patient had severe and prolonged postictal hypoventilation during video EEG monitoring and died later of SUDEP. Mice with an Scn1aR1407X/+ loss-of-function mutation were monitored and died after spontaneous and heat-induced seizures due to central apnea followed by progressive bradycardia. Death could be prevented with mechanical ventilation after seizures were induced by hyperthermia or maximal electroshock. Muscarinic receptor antagonists did not prevent bradycardia or death when given at doses selective for peripheral parasympathetic blockade, whereas apnea, bradycardia, and death were prevented by the same drugs given at doses high enough to cross the blood-brain barrier. When given via intracerebroventricular infusion at a very low dose, a muscarinic receptor antagonist prevented apnea, bradycardia, and death. We conclude that SUDEP in patients with DS can result from primary central apnea, which can cause bradycardia, presumably via a direct effect of hypoxemia on cardiac muscle.",

Remarkably, a fraction of patients also develop focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a neurodevelopmental cortical malformation. We therefore hypothesized that a somatic second-hit mutation arising during brain development may support the focal nature of the dysplasia. Here, using postoperative human tissue, we provide the proof of concept that a biallelic 2-hit - brain somatic and germline - mutational mechanism in DEPDC5 causes focal epilepsy with FCD. We discovered a mutation gradient with a higher rate of mosaicism in the seizure-onset zone than in the surrounding epileptogenic zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate the causality of a Depdc5 brain mosaic inactivation using CRISPR-Cas9 editing and in utero electroporation in a mouse model recapitulating focal epilepsy with FCD and SUDEP-like events.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Seizure-induced inhibition of respiration plays a critical role in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). However, the mechanisms underlying seizure-induced central apnea in pediatric epilepsy are unknown. METHODS: We studied eight pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). We recorded respiration during seizures and during electrical stimulation mapping of 174 forebrain sites. A machine learning algorithm was used to delineate brain regions that inhibit respiration. RESULTS: In two patients, apnea coincided with seizure spread to the amygdala. Supporting a role for the amygdala in breathing inhibition in children, electrically stimulating the amygdala produced apnea in all eight subjects (3- to 17-years-old). These effects did not depend on epilepsy type and were relatively specific to the amygdala as no other site affected breathing. Remarkably, patients were unaware that they had stopped breathing, and none reported dyspnea or arousal, findings critical for SUDEP. Finally, a machine learning algorithm based on 45 stimulation sites and 210 stimulation trials identified a focal subregion in the human amygdala that consistently produced apnea. This site, which we refer to as the Amygdala Inhibition of Respiration (AIR) site includes the medial subregion of the basal nuclei, cortical and medial nuclei, amygdala transition areas, and intercalated neurons. CONCLUSIONS: A focal site in the amygdala inhibits respiration and induces apnea (AIR site) when electrically stimulated and during seizures in children with epilepsy. This site may prove valuable for determining those at greatest risk for SUDEP and as a therapeutic target. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was not affiliated with any formal clinical trial.

In this study, we evaluated distinct animal experiments in multiple research facilities, and assessed whether 20\% body-weight reduction is a valid humane endpoint criterion in rodents. In most experiments (restraint stress, distinct models for epilepsy, pancreatic resection, liver resection, caloric restrictive feeding and a mouse model for Dravet syndrome) the animals lost less than 20\% of their original body weight. In a glioma model, a fast deterioration in body weight of less than 20\% was observed as a reliable predictor for clinical deterioration. In contrast, after induction of chronic diabetes or acute colitis some animals lost more than 20\% of their body weight without exhibiting major signs of distress. In these two animal models an exclusive application of the 20\% weight loss criterion for euthanasia might therefore result in an unnecessary loss of animals. However, we also confirmed that this criterion can be a valid parameter for defining the humane endpoint in other animal models, especially when it is combined with additional criteria for evaluating distress. In conclusion, our findings strongly suggest that experiment and model specific considerations are necessary for the rational integration of the parameter 'weight loss' in severity assessment schemes and humane endpoint criteria. A flexible implementation tailored to the experiment or intervention by scientists and authorities is therefore highly recommended.",

abstract = "This selective review considers the contribution of recent investigations of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) to our understanding of the link between stress and psychopathology associated with limbic epilepsy. Data are reviewed which clearly indicate that CRF does not play a simple modulatory role in behaviour. On the one hand, it is clear that CRF reproduces many of the central effects initiated by environmental stressors. One primary effect of limbic and locus coeruleus CRF systems, at least, seems to be to modulate neural circuitry involved in anxiety. On the other hand, its functioning as a modulator of animal anxiety can vary from anxiogenic, to neutral to anxiolytic, depending on the prior experience of the animal. Handling stress eliminates the anxiogenic action of CRF, and repeated limbic seizures change CRF into an anxiolytic. All of these findings suggest that CRF is an important link between stress and affective disturbance, but the nature of that link is complex and poorly understood. Chronic stress and epileptic disorders probably modify CRF functioning itself, as well as neurotransmitter systems with which CRF interacts. Nevertheless, the data suggest a novel hypothesis regarding the relationship between stress and mood in epileptics and the role of CRF in that relationship.",

The majority of SUDEP cases occur in intractable epilepsy, especially in the aftermath of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. We report an atypical SUDEP case with infrequent seizures in frontal lobe epilepsy. Case Report A 14-year-old girl presented with a 13-year history of paroxysmal convulsions. She experienced three episodes within 6-10 months after birth. At 14 years old, she experienced an aggravated seizure, manifesting as unconsciousness, hyperventilation, and urinary incontinence. Electroencephalography showed spike-slow waves and slow waves with mixed asynchronized spike waves originating from the frontal lobe during the sleep stage. Transient outbreaks of spike-slow complex waves (1-2 s) were also noted in all leads. The diagnosis of frontal lobe epilepsy (generalized tonic-clonic seizures secondary to focal impaired awareness seizures and myoclonus) was made. Oral sodium valproate was prescribed. However, she suddenly died on her way to school 2 months later. Conclusion The causes of SUDEP are complicated, and frontal lobe epilepsy may be a potential risk factor. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of epileptic seizures, as well as close observation, should be emphasized.",

As more is learned about the etiologies and manifestations of epileptic encephalopathies, progress has been made toward better treatment options. However, there is still a great need for further randomized controlled trials and research to help create clinically effective therapies. The 2015 Neurobiology of Disease in Children symposium, held in conjunction with the 44th annual meeting of the Child Neurology Society, aimed to (1) describe the clinical concerns involving diagnosis and treatment, (2) review the current status of understanding in the pathogenesis of epileptic encephalopathy, (3) discuss clinical management and therapies for epileptic encephalopathy, and (4) define future directions of research. This article summarizes the presentations and includes an edited transcript of question-and-answer sessions.",

abstract = "Serotonin (5-hydroxytrytamine (5-HT)) plays an important role in experimental seizures. Recently, we reported the depletion of 5-HT by parachlorophynylalanine (PCPA) in whole brain to enhance 6-Hz psychomotor seizures in mice. In the present work, we investigated the effect of 5-HT depletion in cortex and hippocampus, brain regions relevant for epilepsy, on behavioral and ultra-structural changes following 6-Hz psychomotor seizures in mice. In addition, we studied the effect of sodium valproate (SVP) on behavioral, biochemical, and ultra-structural effects induced by 6 Hz. Behavioral changes induced by 6 Hz stimulation were characterized as the increased duration of Straub's tail, stun position, twitching of vibrissae, forelimb clonus, and increased rearing and grooming. PCPA administration further enhanced while SVP reduced these behaviors in mice. The 6-Hz psychomotor seizure induced ultra-structural changes in both cortex and hippocampus in mice treated with PCPA. Furthermore, PCPA administrations followed by 6Hz-induced seizures were accompanied by reduced hippocampal and cortical 5-HT. SVP attenuated the PCPA-induced ultra-structural changes and alterations of 5-HT content in the mouse brain. The study suggests the involvement of 5-HT in the 6 Hz psychomotor seizures and in the mechanisms of action of SVP against such seizures in mice.",

Yet, if one considers the neurobiological substrates of this disease, what is revealed is an array of phenomenon that exemplify the remarkable capacity for the brain to change its basic structure and function, that is, neural plasticity. Some of these alterations are transient and merely impressive for their extent, or for their robust nature across animal models and human epilepsy. Others are notable for their persistence, often enduring for months or years. As an example, the dentate gyrus, and specifically the principal cell of the dentate gyrus, the granule cell, is highlighted. This area of the brain and this particular cell type, for reasons that are currently unclear, hold an uncanny capacity to change after seizures. For those interested in plasticity, it is suggested that perhaps the best examples for studying plasticity lie in the field of epilepsy.",

These spikes are useful diagnostically, but we do not know why they are so strongly associated with the spontaneous seizures that characterize chronic epilepsy. Interictal spikes appear before the first spontaneous seizures in animal models of acquired epilepsy, and spikes are sufficient to induce long-term changes in synaptic connections between neurons. Thus, spikes may guide the development of the neuronal circuits that initiate spontaneous seizures. If so, then attempts to prevent or cure epilepsy may best be directed at spikes rather than seizures.",

abstract = "Selective Nav1.1 Activation Rescues Dravet Syndrome Mice From Seizures and Premature Death Richards KL, Milligan CJ, Richardson RJ, Jancovski N, Grunnet M, Jacobson LH, Undheim EAB, Mobli M, Chow CY, Herzig V, Csoti A, Panyi G, Reid CA, King GF, Petrou S. PNAS. 2018;115:E8077-E8085. Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic, pharmaco-resistant epileptic encephalopathy. Disease onset occurs in the first year of life, followed by developmental delay with cognitive and behavioral dysfunction and substantially elevated risk of premature death. The majority of affected individuals harbor a loss-of-function mutation in one allele of SCN1A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1. Brain Nav1.1 is primarily localized to fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons; thus, the mechanism of epileptogenesis in Dravet syndrome is hypothesized to be reduced inhibitory neurotransmission leading to brain hyperexcitability. We show that selective activation of Nav1.1 by venom peptide Hm1a restores the function of inhibitory interneurons from Dravet syndrome mice without affecting the firing of excitatory neurons. Intracerebroventricular infusion of Hm1a rescues Dravet syndrome mice from seizures and premature death. This precision medicine approach, which specifically targets the molecular deficit in Dravet syndrome, presents an opportunity for treatment of this intractable epilepsy. A Transient Developmental Window of Fast-Spiking Interneuron Dysfunction in a Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome Favero M, Sotuyo NP, Lopez E, Kearney JA, Goldberg EM. J Neurosci. 2018;38:7912-7927. Dravet syndrome is a severe childhood-onset epilepsy largely due to heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the gene SCN1A, which encodes the type 1 neuronal voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channel $\alpha$ subunit Nav1.1. Prior studies in mouse models of Dravet syndrome ( Scn1a+/- mice) indicate that, in cerebral cortex, Nav1.1 is predominantly expressed in GABAergic interneurons, in particular in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cell interneurons (PVINs). This has led to a model of Dravet syndrome pathogenesis in which Nav1.1 mutation leads to preferential dysfunction of interneurons, decreased synaptic inhibition, hyperexcitability, and epilepsy. However, such studies have been implemented at early developmental time points. Here, we performed electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices prepared from male and female Scn1a+/-mice as well as age-matched wild-type littermate controls and found that, later in development, the excitability of PVINs had normalized. Analysis of action potential waveforms indirectly suggests a reorganization of axonal Na+ channels in PVINs from Scn1a+/- mice, a finding supported by immunohistochemical data showing elongation of the axon initial segment. Our results imply that transient impairment of action potential generation by PVINs may contribute to the initial appearance of epilepsy, but is not the mechanism of ongoing, chronic epilepsy in Dravet syndrome. Significance Statement: Dravet syndrome is characterized by normal early development, temperature-sensitive seizures in infancy, progression to treatment-resistant epilepsy, developmental delay, autism, and sudden unexplained death due to mutation in SCN1A encoding the Na+ channel subunit Nav1.1. Prior work has revealed a preferential impact of Nav1.1 loss on the function of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. However, such data derive exclusively from recordings of neurons in young Scn1a+/- mice. Here, we show that impaired action potential generation observed in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (PVINs) in Scn1a+/- mice during early development has normalized by postnatal day 35. This work suggests that a transient impairment of PVINs contributes to epilepsy onset, but is not the mechanism of ongoing, chronic epilepsy in Dravet syndrome.",

abstract = "Insular seizures are great mimickers of seizures originating elsewhere in the brain. The insula is a highly connected brain structure. Seizures may only become clinically evident after ictal activity propagates out of the insula with semiology that reflects the propagation pattern. Insular seizures with perisylvian spread, for example, manifest first as throat constriction, followed next by perioral and hemisensory symptoms, and then by unilateral motor symptoms. On the other hand, insular seizures may spread instead to the temporal and frontal lobes and present like seizures originating from these regions. Due to the location of the insula deep in the brain, interictal and ictal scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) changes can be variable and misleading. Magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetoencephalography, positron emission tomography, and single-photon computed tomography imaging may assist in establishing a diagnosis of insular epilepsy. Intracranial EEG recordings from within the insula, using stereo-EEG or depth electrode techniques, can prove insular seizure origin. Seizure onset, most commonly seen as low-voltage, fast gamma activity, however, can be highly localized and easily missed if the insula is only sparsely sampled. Moreover, seizure spread to the contralateral insula and other brain regions may occur rapidly. Extensive sampling of the insula with multiple electrode trajectories is necessary to avoid these pitfalls. Understanding the functional organization of the insula is helpful when interpreting the semiology produced by insular seizures. Electrical stimulation mapping around the central sulcus of the insula results in paresthesias, while stimulation of the posterior insula typically produces painful sensations. Visceral sensations are the next most common result of insular stimulation. Treatment of insular epilepsy is evolving, but poses challenges. Surgical resections of the insula are effective but risk significant morbidity if not carefully planned. Neurostimulation is an emerging option for treatment, especially for seizures with onset in the posterior insula. The close association of the insula with marked autonomic changes has led to interest in the role of the insula in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and warrants additional study with larger patient cohorts.",

OBJECTIVE: To characterize peri-ictal apnea and postictal asystole in generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) of intractable epilepsy. METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter epilepsy monitoring study of autonomic and breathing biomarkers of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients $\geq$18 years old with intractable epilepsy and monitored GCS. Video electroencephalography, thoracoabdominal excursions, nasal airflow, capillary oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram were analyzed. RESULTS: We studied 148 GCS in 87 patients. Nineteen patients had generalized epilepsy, 65 had focal epilepsy, 1 had both, and the epileptogenic zone was unknown in 2. Ictal central apnea (ICA) preceded GCS in 49 (40.4\%) of 121 seizures in 23 patients, all with focal epilepsy. Postconvulsive central apnea (PCCA) occurred in 31 (22.1\%) of 140 seizures in 22 patients, with generalized, focal, or unknown epileptogenic zones. In 2 patients, PCCA occurred concurrently with asystole (near-SUDEP), with an incidence rate of 10.2 per 1000 patient-years. One patient with PCCA died of probable SUDEP during follow-up, suggesting a SUDEP incidence rate 5.1 per 1000 patient-years. No cases of laryngospasm were detected. Rhythmic muscle artifact synchronous with breathing was present in 75 of 147 seizures and related to stertorous breathing (odds ratio: 3.856, 95\% confidence interval: 1.395-10.663, P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: Postconvulsive central apnea occurred in both focal and generalized epilepsies, suggesting a different pathophysiology from ICA, which occurred only in focal epilepsy. Postconvulsive central apnea was seen in 2 near-SUDEP cases and 1 probable SUDEP case, suggesting that this phenomenon may serve as a clinical biomarker of SUDEP. Larger studies are needed to validate this observation. Rhythmic postictal muscle artifact is suggestive of post-GCS breathing effort rather than a specific biomarker of laryngospasm.

Neurology. 2019;92:e183-e193. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the factors that determine the occurrence or severity of postictal hypoxemia in the immediate aftermath of a generalized convulsive seizure (GCS). METHODS: We reviewed the video electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of 1006 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy included in the REPO2MSE study to identify those with $\geq$1 GCS and pulse oximetry (SpO2) measurement. Factors determining recovery of SpO2 $\geq$ 90\% were investigated using Cox proportional hazards models. Association between SpO2 nadir and person- or seizure-specific variables was analyzed after correction for individual effects and the varying number of seizures. RESULTS: A total of 107 GCS in 73 patients were analyzed. A transient hypoxemia was observed in 92 (86\%) GCS. Rate of GCS with SpO2 < 70\% dropped from 40\% to 21\% when oxygen was administered early (P = .046). Early recovery of SpO2 $\geq$ 90\% was associated with early administration of oxygen (P = .004), absence of postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES; P = .014), and extratemporal lobe epilepsy (P = .001). Lack of early administration of O2 (P = .003), occurrence of PGES (P = .018), and occurrence of ictal hypoxemia during the focal phase (P = .022) were associated with lower SpO2 nadir. CONCLUSION: Postictal hypoxemia was observed in the immediate aftermath of nearly all GCS, but administration of oxygen had a strong preventive effect. Severity of postictal hypoxemia was greater in temporal lobe epilepsy and when hypoxemia was already observed before the onset of secondary GCS.",

OBJECTIVE: To define a distinct SCN1A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with early onset, profound impairment, and movement disorder. METHODS: A case series of 9 children were identified with a profound developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and SCN1A mutation. RESULTS: We identified 9 children 3 to 12 years of age; 7 were male. Seizure onset was at 6 to 12 weeks with hemiclonic seizures, bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, or spasms. All children had profound developmental impairment and were nonverbal and nonambulatory, and 7 of 9 required a gastrostomy. A hyperkinetic movement disorder occurred in all and was characterized by dystonia and choreoathetosis with prominent oral dyskinesia and onset from 2 to 20 months of age. Eight had a recurrent missense SCN1A mutation, p.Thr226Met. The remaining child had the missense mutation p.Pro1345Ser. The mutation arose de novo in 8 of 9; for the remaining case, the mother was negative and the father was unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present a phenotype-genotype correlation for SCN1A. We describe a distinct SCN1A phenotype, early infantile SCN1A encephalopathy, which is readily distinguishable from the well-recognized entities of Dravet syndrome and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. This disorder has an earlier age at onset, profound developmental impairment, and a distinctive hyperkinetic movement disorder, setting it apart from Dravet syndrome. Remarkably, 8 of 9 children had the recurrent missense mutation p.Thr226Met. SCN1A Gain of Function in Early Infantile Encephalopathy Berecki G, Bryson A, Terhag J, et al. Ann Neurol. 2019; 85:514-525. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the biophysical basis underlying the distinct and severe clinical presentation in patients with the recurrent missense SCN1A variant, p.Thr226Met. Patients with this variant show a well-defined genotype-phenotype correlation and present with developmental and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy that is far more severe than typical SCN1A Dravet syndrome. METHODS: Whole cell patch clamp and dynamic action potential clamp were used to study T226M Nav 1.1 channels expressed in mammalian cells. Computational modeling was used to explore the neuronal scale mechanisms that account for altered action potential firing. RESULTS: T226M channels exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts of the activation and inactivation curves and enhanced fast inactivation. Dynamic action potential clamp hybrid simulation showed that model neurons containing T226M conductance displayed a left shift in rheobase relative to control. At current stimulation levels that produced repetitive action potential firing in control model neurons, depolarization block and cessation of action potential firing occurred in T226M model neurons. Fully computationally simulated neuron models recapitulated the findings from dynamic action potential clamp and showed that heterozygous T226M models were also more susceptible to depolarization block. INTERPRETATION: From a biophysical perspective, the T226M mutation produces gain of function. Somewhat paradoxically, our data suggest that this gain of function would cause interneurons to more readily develop depolarization block. This ``functional dominant negative'' interaction would produce a more profound disinhibition than seen with haploinsufficiency that is typical of Dravet syndrome and could readily explain the more severe phenotype of patients with T226M mutation.",

JCI Insight. 2020;5(6):e134852. doi:10.1172/jci.insight.134852Background:Seizure-induced inhibition of respiration plays a critical role in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). However, the mechanisms underlying seizure-induced central apnea in pediatric epilepsy are unknown.Methods:We studied 8 pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing intracranial electroencephalography. We recorded respiration during seizures and during electrical stimulation mapping of 174 forebrain sites. A machine learning algorithm was used to delineate brain regions that inhibit respiration.Results:In 2 patients, apnea coincided with seizure spread to the amygdala. Supporting a role for the amygdala in breathing inhibition in children, electrically stimulating the amygdala produced apnea in all 8 patients (3-17 years old). These effects did not depend on epilepsy type and were relatively specific to the amygdala, as no other site affected breathing. Remarkably, patients were unaware that they had stopped breathing, and none reported dyspnea or arousal, findings critical for SUDEP. Finally, a machine learning algorithm based on 45 stimulation sites and 210 stimulation trials identified a focal subregion in the human amygdala that consistently produced apnea. This site, which we refer to as the amygdala inhibition of respiration (AIR) site, includes the medial subregion of the basal nuclei, cortical and medial nuclei, amygdala transition areas, and intercalated neurons.Conclusions:A focal site in the amygdala inhibits respiration and induces apnea (AIR site) when electrically stimulated and during seizures in children with epilepsy. This site may prove valuable for determining those at greatest risk for SUDEP and as a therapeutic target.Seizure-Related Apneas Have an Inconsistent Linkage to Amygdala Seizure Spread Park K, Kanth K, Bajwa S, et al. Epilepsia. 2020;61(6):1253-1260.Objective:Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a frequent cause of death in epilepsy. Respiratory dysfunction is implicated as a critical factor in SUDEP pathophysiology. Human studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the amygdala resulted in apnea, indicating that the amygdala has a role in respiration control. Unilateral amygdala stimulation resulted in immediate onset of respiratory dysfunction occurring only during nose breathing. In small numbers of patients, some but not all spontaneous seizures resulted in apnea occurring shortly after seizure spread to the amygdala. With this study, we aimed to determine whether seizure onset or spread to the amygdala was necessary and sufficient to cause apnea.Methods:We investigated the temporal relationship between apnea/hypopnea (AH) onset and initial seizure involvement within the amygdala in patients with implanted depth electrodes.Results:Data from 17 patients (11 female) with 47 seizures were analyzed. With 7 seizures (3 patients), AH preceded amygdala seizure involvement by 2 to 55 seconds. There was no AH with 4 seizures (3 patients) that involved the amygdala. With 8 seizures (4 patients), AH occurred within 2 seconds following amygdala seizure onset. With 28 seizures, AH started >2 seconds after amygdala seizure onset (range: 3-158 seconds). Following seizure onset, there was a significant difference between AH onset time and amygdala seizure onset (P < .001). The mean $\pm$ standard deviation AH onset was 27.8 $\pm$ 41.06 seconds, and the mean time to amygdala involvement was 8.83 $\pm$ 20.19 seconds.Significance:There is a wide range of AH onset times relative to amygdala seizure involvement. With some seizures, amygdala seizure involvement occurs without AH. With other seizures, AH precedes amygdala seizures, suggesting that, with spontaneous seizures, involvement of the amygdala may not be crucial to induction of AH with all seizures. Other pathophysiology impacting brain stem respiratory networks may be of greater relevance to seizure-triggered apneas.",

abstract = "Association of Peri-Ictal Brainstem Posturing With Seizure Severity and Breathing Compromise in Patients With Generalized Convulsive SeizuresVilella L, Lacuey N, Hampson JP, et al. Neurology. 2021;96(3):e352-e365. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000011274Objective:To analyze the association between peri-ictal brainstem posturing semiologies with postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression (PGES) and breathing dysfunction in generalized convulsive seizures (GCS).Methods:In this prospective, multicenter analysis of GCS, ictal brainstem semiology was classified as (1) decerebration (bilateral symmetric tonic arm extension), (2) decortication (bilateral symmetric tonic arm flexion only), (3) hemi-decerebration (unilateral tonic arm extension with contralateral flexion), and (4) absence of ictal tonic phase. Postictal posturing was also assessed. Respiration was monitored with thoracoabdominal belts, video, and pulse oximetry.Results:Two hundred ninety-five seizures (180 patients) were analyzed. Ictal decerebration was observed in 122 (41.4\%) of 295, decortication in 47 (15.9\%) of 295, and hemi-decerebration in 28 (9.5\%) of 295 seizures. Tonic phase was absent in 98 (33.2\%) of 295 seizures. Postictal posturing occurred in 18 (6.1\%) of 295 seizures. Postictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression risk increased with ictal decerebration (odds ratio [OR]: 14.79, 95\% CI: 6.18-35.39, P < .001), decortication (OR: 11.26, 95\% CI: 2.96-42.93, P < .001), or hemi-decerebration (OR: 48.56, 95\% CI: 6.07-388.78, P < .001). Ictal decerebration was associated with longer PGES (P = .011). Postictal posturing was associated with postconvulsive central apnea (PCCA; P = .004), longer hypoxemia (P < .001), and Spo2 recovery (P = .035).Conclusions:Ictal brainstem semiology is associated with increased PGES risk. Ictal decerebration is associated with longer PGES. Postictal posturing is associated with a 6-fold increased risk of PCCA, longer hypoxemia, and Spo2 recovery. Peri-ictal brainstem posturing may be a surrogate biomarker for GCS severity identifiable without in-hospital monitoring.Classification of evidence:This study provides Class III evidence that peri-ictal brainstem posturing is associated with the GCS with more prolonged PGES and more severe breathing dysfunction.",

The resultant sleep deprivation (SD) is an exacerbating factor for seizures that sets up a vicious cycle that can potentially lead to disease progression and even to epilepsy-related mortality. A variety of cellular or network electrophysiological changes and changes in expression of clock-controlled genes or other transcription factors underlie sleep-wake and circadian distribution of seizures, as well as the disruptions seen in both.

abstract = "Disturbances of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are common in neuropsychiatric disorders. Disease specific alterations of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity can be assessed by heart rate variability (HRV), whereas electrodermal activity (EDA) can assess sympathetic activity. In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), parasympathetic HRV parameters are typically decreased and EDA is increased, whereas in major depressive disorder (MDD) and dissociation, both parasympathetic and sympathetic markers are decreased. ANS abnormalities have also been identified in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) by using HRV, indicating lower parasympathetic activity at baseline. In addition to reviewing the current literature on ANS abnormalities in PTSD, MDD, and disorders with prominent dissociation, including borderline personality disorder (BPD), this article also presents data from a pilot study on EDA in patients with PNES. Eleven patients with PNES, during an admission to our epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), were compared with 9 with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The area under the EDA curve, the number of EDA responses lasting longer than 2 seconds, and the number of EDA surges during sleep (sympathetic sleep storms) were calculated on ictal and interictal days by an automated algorithm. EDA changes in PNES patients did not follow a systematic pattern of sympathetic hyperarousal (like EDA after GTCS) but were more variable. How specific PNES semiologies, and/or underlying neuropsychiatric disorders, may influence ictal and interictal EDA patterns, and lead to a novel diagnostic biomarker remains to be evaluated in future larger studies.",

Since the best available data are from the treatment of Dravet syndrome, we will focus primarily on this condition. Originally fenfluramine was launched as an anorectic agent. As early as 1985, seizure reduction in children could be demonstrated in a few cases with photosensitive, self-induced epilepsy. Hereafter, a small study was launched in patients with self-induced epilepsy. Results showed a significant seizure reduction, and review of the patient data showed that 5 of the 12 patients had Dravet syndrome. During that observation period, fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market because of cardiovascular side effects associated with prescribing higher doses in combination with phentermine for weight loss. In March 2002, a Belgian Royal Decree was issued permitting further study of fenfluramine in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy. In 2011 under the Royal Decree, a prospective study of patients with Dravet syndrome treated with low-dose fenfluramine was initiated and is currently ongoing. The initial results are promising in terms of reduction of seizure frequency and overall tolerability.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in refractory epilepsy patients. Accumulating evidence from recent human studies and animal models suggests that seizure-related respiratory arrest may be important for initiating cardiorespiratory arrest and death. Prior evidence suggests that apnea onset can coincide with seizure spread to the amygdala and that stimulation of the amygdala can reliably induce apneas in epilepsy patients, potentially implicating amygdalar regions in seizure-related respiratory arrest and subsequent postictal hypoventilation and cardiorespiratory death. This study aimed to determine if an extended amygdalar structure, the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST), is involved in seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) and death using DBA/1 mice, a mouse strain which has audiogenic seizures and a high incidence of postictal respiratory arrest and death. The presence of S-IRA significantly increased c-Fos expression in the dBNST of DBA/1 mice. Furthermore, disruption of synaptic output from the dBNST via viral-induced tetanus neurotoxin significantly improved survival following S-IRA in DBA/1 mice without affecting baseline breathing or hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory response. This disruption in the dBNST resulted in changes to the balance of excitatory/inhibitory synaptic events in the downstream brainstem regions of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). These findings suggest that the dBNST is a potential subcortical forebrain site necessary for the mediation of seizure-induced respiratory arrest, potentially through its outputs to brainstem respiratory regions. SUMMARY STATEMENT This study used a viral expression technique to disrupt synaptic output in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) of DBA/1 audiogenic seizure mice. Inactivating the BNST significantly improved survival following seizures and altered brainstem excitation/inhibition balance. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",

Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is used in Europe for intractable epilepsy and yields similar response rates to RNS using duty cycle stimulation.

To explore patients' experiences surrounding SUDEP disclosure and opinions on how information should be delivered. DESIGN: A cross-sectional questionnaire. SETTING: Royal Free Hospital, London outpatient epilepsy clinics. PARTICIPANTS: New and follow-up patients attending epilepsy clinics at a London teaching hospital over six months. Patients identified as being at risk of suffering negative emotional or psychological consequences of SUDEP discussions were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient knowledge about epilepsy risks; patient opinion regarding source, timing and delivery of SUDEP information; impact on health seeking behaviour. RESULTS: Ninety-eight per cent of patients were aware of medication adherence, 84\% of factors influencing seizure frequency, 78\% of driving regulations, 50\% of SUDEP and 38\% of status epilepticus; 72\% of patients felt that SUDEP information should be given to all patients. Preferences for timing of SUDEP discussions varied between those wanting information at diagnosis (40\%) and those preferring to receive it after three clinic appointments (18\%) to avoid information overload at the first consultation. Emotional responses (48\% positive, 38\% negative) predominated over measurable behavioural change following SUDEP discussions. CONCLUSIONS: Less than half the patients knew about SUDEP and status epilepticus. Although the majority of patients with epilepsy wish to be informed about SUDEP early on in their diagnosis, information must be delivered in a way that promotes patient knowledge and empowerment.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the most common type of focal epilepsy in adults, is often caused by hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Patients with HS usually present memory dysfunction, which is material-specific according to the hemisphere involved and has been correlated to the degree of HS as measured by postoperative histopathology as well as by the degree of hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Verbal memory is mostly affected by left-sided HS, whereas visuo-spatial memory is more affected by right HS. Some of these impairments may be related to abnormalities of the network in which individual hippocampus takes part. Functional connectivity can play an important role to understand how the hippocampi interact with other brain areas. It can be estimated via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) resting state experiments by evaluating patterns of functional networks. In this study, we investigated the functional connectivity patterns of 9 control subjects, 9 patients with right MTLE and 9 patients with left MTLE. RESULTS: We detected differences in functional connectivity within and between hippocampi in patients with unilateral MTLE associated with ipsilateral HS by resting state fMRI. Functional connectivity resulted to be more impaired ipsilateral to the seizure focus in both patient groups when compared to control subjects. This effect was even more pronounced for the left MTLE group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented here suggest that left HS causes more reduction of functional connectivity than right HS in subjects with left hemisphere dominance for language.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: With a complex and extremely high clinical and genetic heterogeneity, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are better dissected if one takes into account specific endophenotypes. Comorbidity of ASD with epilepsy (or paroxysmal EEG) has long been described and seems to have strong genetic background. Macrocephaly also represents a well-known endophenotype in subgroups of ASD individuals, which suggests pathogenic mechanisms accelerating brain growth in early development and predisposing to the disorder. We attempted to estimate the association of gene variants with neurodevelopmental disorders in patients with autism-epilepsy phenotype (AEP) and cranial overgrowth, analyzing two genes previously reported to be associated with autism and macrocephaly. METHODS: We analyzed the coding sequences and exon-intron boundaries of GLIALCAM, encoding an IgG-like cell adhesion protein, in 81 individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders, either with or without comorbid epilepsy, paroxysmal EEG and/or macrocephaly, and the PTEN gene in the subsample with macrocephaly. RESULTS: Among 81 individuals with ASD, 31 had concurrent macrocephaly. Head circumference, moreover, was over the 99.7th percentile (``extreme'' macrocephaly) in 6/31 (19\%) patients. Whilst we detected in GLIALCAM several single nucleotide variants without clear pathogenic effects, we found a novel PTEN heterozygous frameshift mutation in one case with ``extreme'' macrocephaly, autism, intellectual disability and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find a clear association between GLIALCAM mutations and AEP-macrocephaly comorbidity. The identification of a novel frameshift variant of PTEN in a patient with ``extreme'' macrocephaly, autism, intellectual disability and seizures, confirms this gene as a major candidate in the ASD-macrocephaly endophenotype. The concurrence of epilepsy in the same patient also suggests that PTEN, and the downstream signaling pathway, might deserve to be investigated in autism-epilepsy comorbidity. Working on clinical endophenotypes might be of help to address genetic studies and establish actual causative correlations in autism-epilepsy.",

This study aimed to investigate differentially expressed lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the susceptibility gaining process of primed DBA/1 mice, a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) model, to illustrate the potential role of lncRNAs in SUDEP. METHODS: The Arraystar mouse lncRNA Microarray V3.0 (Arraystar, Rockville, MD) was applied to identify the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between primed DBA/1 mice and normal controls. The differences were verified by qRT-PCR. We conducted gene ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and coexpression analyses to explore the possible function of the dysregulated RNAs. RESULTS: A total of 502 lncRNAs (126 upregulated and 376 downregulated lncRNAs) and 263 mRNAs (141 upregulated and 122 downregulated mRNAs) were dysregulated with P < 0.05 and a fold change over 1.5, among which Adora3 and Gstt4 were possibly related to SUDEP. GO analysis revealed that chaperone cofactor-dependent protein refolding and misfolded protein binding were among the top ten downregulated terms, which pointed to Hspa1a, Hspa2a and their related lncRNAs. KEGG analysis identified 28 upregulated and 10 downregulated pathways. Coexpression analysis showed fifteen dysregulated long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and three aberrantly expressed antisense lncRNAs, of which AK012034 and NR\_040757 are potentially related to SUDEP by regulating LMNB2 and ITPR1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNAs and their coexpression mRNAs are dysregulated in the priming process of DBA/1 in the brainstem. Some of these mRNAs and lncRNAs may be related to SUDEP, including Adora3, Lmnb2, Hspa1a, Hspa1b, Itrp1, Gstt4 and their related lncRNAs.

CASE PRESENTATION: We describe two females who fulfill the diagnostic criteria for classic RTT, with pathogenic de novo mutations in SCN1A, which usually leads to Dravet syndrome. The developmental history and clinical features of these two females fits well with RTT, but they do have an unusual epileptic profile with early onset of seizures. Investigation of mRNA from one of the females showed a significantly reduced level of MECP2 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that SCN1A mutations could account for a proportion of the females with classic RTT without MECP2 mutations. As a consequence of these findings SCN1A should be considered in the molecular routine screening in MECP2-negative individuals with RTT and early onset epilepsy.",

RESULTS: Patients (n = 308) were randomized to LEV (n = 48) or VPA-ER (n = 53) in the VPE-ER stratum or to LEV (n = 104) or CBZ-CR (n = 103) in the CBZ-CR stratum. Mean age was 69.6 years, range 60.2-89.9 years (intention-to-treat population n = 307). Time to treatment withdrawal hazard ratio [HR] (95 \% confidence interval [CI]) for LEV vs. standard AEDs was 0.44 (0.28-0.67); LEV vs. VPA-ER: 0.46 (0.16-1.33); LEV vs. CBZ-CR: 0.45 (0.28-0.72). Twelve-month withdrawal rates were: LEV vs. standard AEDs, 20.4 vs. 38.7 \%; LEV vs. VPA-ER, 10.4 vs. 23.1 \%; LEV vs. CBZ-CR, 25.0 vs. 46.6 \%. Time to first seizure was similar between LEV and standard AEDs (HR: 0.92, 95 \% CI: 0.63-1.35), LEV and VPA-ER (0.77, 0.38-1.56), and LEV and CBZ-CR (1.02, 0.64-1.63). Adverse events were reported by 76.2, 67.3, and 82.5 \% of patients for LEV, VPA-ER, and CBZ-CR, respectively. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were 11.3, 10.2, and 35.0 \% for LEV, VPA-ER, and CBZ-CR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Time to treatment withdrawal was longer with LEV compared with standard AEDs. This finding was driven primarly by the result in the CBZ-CR stratum, which in turn was likely due to the more favorable tolerability profile of LEV. Results of this post-hoc analysis suggest that LEV may be a suitable option for initial monotherapy for patients aged $\geq$ 60 years with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) are increasingly used to help patients cope with physical and mental long-term conditions (LTCs). Epilepsy is associated with a range of mental and physical comorbidities that have a detrimental effect on quality of life (QOL), but it is not clear whether MBIs can help. We systematically reviewed the literature to determine the effectiveness of MBIs in people with epilepsy. METHODS: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL, Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database, and PsychInfo were searched in March 2016. These databases were searched using a combination of subject headings where available and keywords in the title and abstracts. We also searched the reference lists of related reviews. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 231 participants were included. The interventions were tested in the USA (n = 171) and China (Hong Kong) (n = 60). Significant improvements were reported in depression symptoms, quality of life, anxiety, and depression knowledge and skills. Two of the included studies were assessed as being at unclear/high risk of bias - with randomisation and allocation procedures, as well as adverse events and reasons for drop-outs poorly reported. There was no reporting on intervention costs/benefits or how they affected health service utilisation. CONCLUSION: This systematic review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of MBIs in epilepsy, however preliminary evidence suggests it may lead to some improvement in anxiety, depression and quality of life. Further trials with larger sample sizes, active control groups and longer follow-ups are needed before the evidence for MBIs in epilepsy can be conclusively determined.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy is a rare and severe disorder caused by mutations in the GOSR2 gene. It is clinically characterized by progressive myoclonus, seizures, early-onset ataxia and areflexia. As in other progressive myoclonus epilepsies, the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs is disappointingly limited in North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy. The ketogenic diet and the less restrictive modified Atkins diet have been proven to be effective in other drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes, including those with myoclonic seizures. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the modified Atkins diet in patients with North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy. RESULTS: Four North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy patients (aged 7-20 years) participated in an observational, prospective, open-label study on the efficacy of the modified Atkins diet. Several clinical parameters were assessed at baseline and again after participants had been on the diet for 3 months. The primary outcome measure was health-related quality of life, with seizure frequency and blinded rated myoclonus severity as secondary outcome measures. Ketosis was achieved within 2 weeks and all patients completed the 3 months on the modified Atkins diet. The diet was well tolerated by all four patients. Health-related quality of life improved considerably in one patient and showed sustained improvement during long-term follow-up, despite the progressive nature of the disorder. Health-related quality of life remained broadly unchanged in the other three patients and they did not continue the diet. Seizure frequency remained stable and blinded rating of their myoclonus showed improvement, albeit modest, in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: This observational, prospective study shows that some North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy patients may benefit from the modified Atkins diet with sustained health-related quality of life improvement. Not all our patients continued on the diet, but nonetheless we show that the modified Atkins diet might be considered as a possible treatment in this devastating disorder.",

abstract = "Various cardiac and autonomic manifestations are frequently reported during seizures. Among the seizure-related arrhythmia, ictal tachycardia is the most common, followed by ictal bradycardia, with ictal asystole being the rarest. The occurrence of ictal asystole may obscure the clinical presentation and delay the diagnosis, representing a life-threatening presentation of epilepsy, with an elevated risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP). These cardiac abnormalities are being increasingly recognized as the key to elucidating the mechanisms of SUDEP. We present a 35-year-old man with a history of focal-onset seizures with impaired consciousness since his mid-20 s. He developed different types of seizures for 2 years, described as tonic seizure and atonic seizure (drop attack). During such clinical events, he suffered from falls and cardiac arrest. However, thorough cardiac electrophysiology and imaging workup failed to reveal a cardiac etiology. Subsequent video electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring was performed, and ictal bradycardia and ictal asystole were discovered. A cardiac pacemaker was implanted, and at 3-year follow-up, the patient did not suffer more atonic seizures, or falls. Genetic tests discovered a de novo variant of Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor V1 (ADGRV1), which may provide a clue for the patient's ictal asystole and the increased risk of SUDEP. Considering the important impact of ictal bradycardia and asystole on the morbidity and potential mortality of epileptic patients, it is important to simultaneously utilize EEG and electrocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis. This case report highlights the link between the de novo variant of ADGRV1 and the ictal bradycardia/asystole phenotype and implicates the importance of genetic testing in adult epilepsy patients.",

There is now clear evidence that there are distinct differences between the immature and mature brain in the pathophysiology and consequences of seizures. Both the enhanced excitability of the immature brain compared with the mature brain and the unique pathologic consequences of seizures are related to the sequential development and expression of essential signaling pathways. Although the immature brain is less vulnerable than the mature brain to seizure-induced cell death, seizures in the developing brain can result in irreversible alterations in neuronal connectivity. Developing novel strategies to treat and avert the consequences of seizures in children will require further understanding of the unique mechanisms of seizure initiation and propagation in the immature brain.",

abstract = "Kisspeptin, encoded by Kiss1, activates reproduction by stimulating GnRH neurons. Although most Kiss1 neurons are located in the hypothalamus, smaller Kiss1 populations also reside in the medial amygdala (MeA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BnST), and lateral septum (LS). However, very little is known about the regulation and function of these extra-hypothalamic Kiss1 neurons. This study focused on the roles and interactions of two signaling factors, estradiol (E2) and GABA, known to stimulate and inhibit, respectively, extra-hypothalamic Kiss1 expression. First, using estrogen receptor (ER)$\alpha$ knockout (KO) and $\beta$ERKO mice, we demonstrated that Kiss1 in both the BnST and LS is stimulated by E2, as occurs in the MeA, and that this E2 upregulation occurs via ER$\alpha$, but not ER$\beta$. Second, using GABABR KO and wild-type mice, we determined that whereas E2 normally increases extra-hypothalamic Kiss1 levels, such upregulation by E2 is further enhanced by the concurrent absence of GABABR signaling in the MeA and LS, but not the BnST. Third, we demonstrated that when GABABR signaling is absent, the additional removal of gonadal sex steroids does not abolish Kiss1 expression in the MeA and BnST, and in some cases the LS. Thus, Kiss1 expression in these extra-hypothalamic regions is not solely dependent on E2 stimulation. Finally, we demonstrated a significant positive correlation between Kiss1 levels in the MeA, BnST, and LS, but not between these regions and the hypothalamus (anteroventral periventricular nucleus/periventricular nucleus). Collectively, our findings indicate that both E2 and GABA independently regulate all three extra-hypothalamic Kiss1 populations, but their regulatory interactions may vary by brain region and additional yet-to-be-identified factors are likely involved.",

The major treatment challenge is patients with refractory epilepsy. Whereas neurologists typically focus on seizure reduction in the treatment of these patients, results of studies relating seizure frequency to QOL are conflicting. As depression is associated with reduced QOL in epilepsy and antiepileptic medications (AEDs) can cause depression, it is important to determine the relative roles of depression and seizure frequency in QOL in refractory epilepsy. METHODS: Prospective evaluation was conducted of patients with refractory epilepsy being admitted to an inpatient video-EEG monitoring unit. The impact of clinical variables (age, sex, marital status, seizure frequency, duration and type of seizure disorder, seizure localization, number of AEDs, depression) on QOL was analyzed. RESULTS: Depression was a powerful predictor of QOL (n = 122, beta = -35.8, p < 0.0001). No other variable predicted QOL. Depression was common (54\%), severe (19\% with suicidal thoughts), underdiagnosed (37\%), and largely untreated (17\% on antidepressants).

METHODS: Data from subjects enrolled in a prospective multicenter study of resective epilepsy surgery were reviewed with the Beck Psychiatric Symptoms Scales (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] and Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) and Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) up to a 24-month period. chi2 analyses were used to correlate proportions. RESULTS: A total of 358 presurgical BDI and 360 BAI results were reviewed. Moderate and severe levels of depression were reported in 22.1\% of patients, and similar levels of anxiety were reported by 24.7\%. Postoperative rates of depression and anxiety declined at the 3-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up periods. At the 24-month follow-up, moderate to severe levels of depression symptoms were reported in 17.6 and 14.7\% of the patients who continued to have postoperative seizures. Moderate to severe depression and anxiety were found in 8.2\% of those who were seizure-free. There was no relationship, prior to surgery, between the presence or absence of depression and anxiety and the laterality or location of the seizure onset. There were no significant relationships between depression or anxiety at 24-month follow-up and the laterality or location of the surgery.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Ictal asystole (IA) is a rare event mostly seen in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and a potential contributor to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Clinical and video-electroencephalographic findings associated with IA have not been described, and may be helpful in screening for high risk patients. METHODS: A database search was performed of 6,825 patients undergoing long-term video-EEG monitoring for episodes of IA. RESULTS: IA was recorded in 0.27\% of all patients with epilepsy, eight with temporal (TLE), two with extratemporal (XTLE), and none with generalized epilepsy. In 8 out of 16 recorded events, all occurring in patients with TLE, seizures were associated with a sudden atonia on average 42 seconds into the typical semiology of a complex partial seizure. The loss of tone followed after a period of asystole usually lasting longer than 8 seconds and was associated with typical EEG changes seen otherwise with cerebral hypoperfusion. Clinical predisposing factors for IA including cardiovascular risk factors or baseline ECG abnormalities were not identified. CONCLUSION: Ictal asystole is a rare feature of patients with focal epilepsy. Delayed loss of tone is distinctly uncommon in patients with temporal lobe seizures, but may inevitably occur in patients with ictal asystole after a critical duration of cardiac arrest and cerebral hypoperfusion. Further cardiac monitoring in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and a history of unexpected collapse and falls late in the course of a typical seizure may be warranted and can potentially help to prevent sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of seizure occurrence with candidate seizure precipitants in a prospective diary study, and to determine the relationship of precipitants to seizure self-prediction. METHODS: Eligible subjects were 18 or older, had localization-related epilepsy, at least one seizure within 12 months, and were able to maintain a daily diary. Information collected included the occurrence, time and characteristics of all seizures, hours of sleep, medication compliance, stress, anxiety, alcohol use, menstruation, and seizure self-prediction. Each night, subjects reported their estimate of the likelihood of a seizure the next day (self-prediction). Logit-normal models with a random subject-specific intercept were used to estimate an OR for the association of precipitants with seizure occurrence. RESULTS: Seventy-one subjects returned 15,179 complete diary days. For each hour of increased sleep on the preceding night, the relative odds of a seizure the following day decreased (OR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.82, 0.99). One-unit increments of stress and anxiety (on a 10-point scale) were associated with an increased risk of seizure the following day (OR 1.06, 95\% CI 1.01, 1.12 and OR 1.07; 95\% CI 1.02, 1.12). With self-prediction included in the model, self-prediction (OR 3.7; 95\% CI 1.8, 7.2) and hours of sleep for the night prior to the seizure (OR 0.90; 95\% CI 0.82, 0.99) remained significant. CONCLUSION: Lack of sleep and higher self-reported stress and anxiety levels were associated with seizure occurrence. In a model that included self-prediction, less sleep, and self-prediction had significant effects, whereas stress and anxiety did not. The psychological and biologic mechanisms which link stress and anxiety to self-prediction of seizures requires further exploration. Ultimately, seizure prediction based on precipitants, premonitory features, and self-prediction may provide a foundation for preemptive treatment.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be recorded in epileptic patients with clinical intracranial EEG. HFOs have been associated with seizure genesis because they occur in the seizure focus and during seizure onset. HFOs are also found interictally, partly co-occurring with epileptic spikes. We studied how HFOs are influenced by antiepileptic medication and seizure occurrence, to improve understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical meaning of HFOs. METHODS: Intracerebral depth EEG was partly sampled at 2,000 Hz in 42 patients with intractable focal epilepsy. Patients with five or more usable nights of recording were selected. A sample of slow-wave sleep from each night was analyzed, and HFOs (ripples: 80-250 Hz, fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) and spikes were identified on all artifact-free channels. The HFOs and spikes were compared before and after seizures with stable medication dose and during medication reduction with no intervening seizures. RESULTS: Twelve patients with five to eight nights were included. After seizures, there was an increase in spikes, whereas HFO rates remained the same. Medication reduction was followed by an increase in HFO rates and mean duration. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) do not increase after seizures, but do so after medication reduction, similarly to seizures. This implies that spikes and HFOs have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and that HFOs are more tightly linked to seizures than spikes. HFOs seem to play an important role in seizure genesis and can be a useful clinical marker for disease activity.",

abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Assessment of the patient with a first seizure is a common and important neurologic issue. Less than 50\% of patients who have a first unprovoked seizure have a second seizure; thus, the evaluation should focus on determining the patient's risk of seizure recurrence. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of population studies, including some classic reports, have identified the relative risk factors for subsequent seizure recurrence. The 2014 update of the International League Against Epilepsy definition of epilepsy incorporates these findings, and in 2015, the American Academy of Neurology published a guideline that analyzed the available data. SUMMARY: Provoked or acute symptomatic seizures do not confer increased risk for subsequent unprovoked seizure recurrence. Multiple seizures in a given 24-hour period do not increase the risk of seizure recurrence. Remote symptomatic seizures, an epileptiform EEG, a significant brain imaging abnormality, and nocturnal seizures are risk factors for seizure recurrence. Antiepileptic drug therapy delays the time to second seizure but may not influence long-term remission.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the ambulatory EEG (aEEG) at detecting interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs)/seizures compared with routine EEG (rEEG) and repetitive/second rEEG in patients with a first single unprovoked seizure (FSUS). We also evaluated the association between IED/seizures on aEEG and seizure recurrence within 1 year of follow-up. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 100 consecutive patients with FSUS at the provincial Single Seizure Clinic. They underwent 3 sequential EEG modalities: first rEEG, second rEEG, and aEEG. Clinical epilepsy diagnosis was ascertained based on the 2014 International League Against Epilepsy definition by a neurologist/epileptologist at the clinic. An EEG-certified epileptologist/neurologist interpreted all 3 EEGs. All patients were followed up for 52 weeks until they had either second unprovoked seizure or maintained single seizure status. Accuracy measures (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and likelihood ratios), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each EEG modality. Life tables and the Cox proportional hazard model were used to estimate the probability and association of seizure recurrence. RESULTS: Ambulatory EEG captured IED/seizures with a sensitivity of 72\%, compared with 11\% for the first rEEG and 22\% for the second rEEG. The diagnostic performance of the aEEG was statistically better (AUC: 0.85) compared with the first rEEG (AUC: 0.56) and second rEEG (AUC: 0.60). There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 EEG modalities regarding specificity and positive predictive value. Finally, IED/seizure on the aEEG was associated with more than 3 times the hazard of seizure recurrence. DISCUSSION: The overall diagnostic accuracy of aEEG at capturing IED/seizures in people presenting with FSUS was higher than the first and second rEEGs. We also found that IED/seizures on the aEEG were associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence supporting that, in adults with First Single Unprovoked Seizure (FSUS), 24-h ambulatory EEG has increased sensitivity when compared with routine and repeated EEG.",

METHODS: We identified 15 probands with EAF in whom an LGI1 mutation had been excluded. We performed electroclinical phenotyping on all probands and available affected relatives. We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 20 individuals with EAF (including all the probands and 5 relatives) to identify single nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, and copy number variants. RESULTS: WES revealed likely pathogenic variants in genes that had not been previously associated with EAF: a CNTNAP2 intragenic deletion, 2 truncating mutations of DEPDC5, and a missense SCN1A change. CONCLUSIONS: EAF is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. The association of EAF with CNTNAP2, DEPDC5, and SCN1A mutations widens the phenotypic spectrum related to these genes. CNTNAP2 encodes CASPR2, a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel complex in which LGI1 plays a role. The finding of a CNTNAP2 deletion emphasizes the importance of this complex in EAF and shows biological convergence.",

METHODS: We collected 20 blood-brain paired samples from patients with FCD and searched for somatic variants using deep-targeted gene panel sequencing. Germline mutations in MTOR were assessed in a French research cohort of 93 probands with focal epilepsies and in a diagnostic Danish cohort of 245 patients with a broad range of epilepsies. Data sharing among collaborators allowed us to ascertain additional germline variants in MTOR. RESULTS: We detected recurrent somatic variants (p.Ser2215Phe, p.Ser2215Tyr, and p.Leu1460Pro) in the MTOR gene in 37\% of participants with FCD II and showed histologic evidence for activation of the mTORC1 signaling cascade in brain tissue. We further identified 5 novel de novo germline missense MTOR variants in 6 individuals with a variable phenotype from focal, and less frequently generalized, epilepsies without brain malformations, to macrocephaly, with or without moderate intellectual disability. In addition, an inherited variant was found in a mother-daughter pair with nonlesional autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.

METHODS: We defined relevant questions and systematically reviewed published studies according to the American Academy of Neurology's classification of evidence criteria; we based recommendations on evidence level. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that their seizure recurrence risk is greatest early within the first 2 years (21\%-45\%) (Level A), and clinical variables associated with increased risk may include a prior brain insult (Level A), an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities (Level A), a significant brain-imaging abnormality (Level B), and a nocturnal seizure (Level B). Immediate antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likely to reduce recurrence risk within the first 2 years (Level B) but may not improve quality of life (Level C). Over a longer term (>3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely to improve prognosis as measured by sustained seizure remission (Level B). Patients should be advised that risk of AED adverse events (AEs) may range from 7\% to 31\% (Level B) and that these AEs are likely predominantly mild and reversible. Clinicians' recommendations whether to initiate immediate AED treatment after a first seizure should be based on individualized assessments that weigh the risk of recurrence against the AEs of AED therapy, consider educated patient preferences, and advise that immediate treatment will not improve the long-term prognosis for seizure remission but will reduce seizure risk over the subsequent 2 years.",

author = "Devinsky, Orrin and Spruill, Tanya and Thurman, David and Friedman, Daniel",
abstract = "Epilepsy is associated with a high rate of premature mortality from direct and indirect effects of seizures, epilepsy, and antiseizure therapies. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the second leading neurologic cause of total lost potential life-years after stroke, yet SUDEP may account for less than half of all epilepsy-related deaths. Some epilepsy groups are especially vulnerable: individuals from low socioeconomic status groups and those with comorbid psychiatric illness die more often than controls. Despite clear evidence of an important public health problem, efforts to assess and prevent epilepsy-related deaths remain inadequate. We discuss factors contributing to the underestimation of SUDEP and other epilepsy-related causes of death. We suggest the need for a systematic classification of deaths directly due to epilepsy (e.g., SUDEP, drowning), due to acute symptomatic seizures, and indirectly due to epilepsy (e.g., suicide, chronic effects of antiseizure medications). Accurately estimating the frequency of epilepsy-related mortality is essential to support the development and assessment of preventive interventions. We propose that educational interventions and public health campaigns targeting medication adherence, psychiatric comorbidity, and other modifiable risk factors may reduce epilepsy-related mortality. Educational campaigns regarding sudden infant death syndrome and fires, which kill far fewer Americans than epilepsy, have been widely implemented. We have done too little to prevent epilepsy-related deaths. Everyone with epilepsy and everyone who treats people with epilepsy need to know that controlling seizures will save lives.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The risk of premature mortality is increased in people with epilepsy. The reasons for this and how it may relate to epilepsy etiology remain unclear. METHODS: The National General Practice Study of Epilepsy is a prospective, community-based cohort that includes 558 people with recurrent unprovoked seizures of whom 34\% died during almost 25 years of follow-up. We assessed the underlying and immediate causes of death and their relationship to epilepsy etiology. Psychiatric and somatic comorbidities of epilepsy as predictors of mortality were scrutinized using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The 3 most common underlying causes of death were noncerebral neoplasm, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular disease, accounting for 59\% (111/189) of deaths, while epilepsy-related causes (e.g., sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) accounted for 3\% (6/189) of deaths. In 23\% (43/189) of individuals, the underlying cause of death was directly related to the epilepsy etiology; this was significantly more likely if death occurred within 2 years of the index seizure (percent ratio 4.28 [95\% confidence interval 2.63-6.97]). Specific comorbidities independently associated with increased risk of mortality were neoplasms (primary cerebral and noncerebral neoplasm), certain neurologic diseases, and substance abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid diseases are important causes of death, as well as predictors of premature mortality in epilepsy. There is an especially strong relationship between cause of death and epilepsy etiology in the first 2 years after the index seizure. Addressing these issues may help stem the tide of premature mortality in epilepsy.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To seek a neuropathologic signature of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in a postmortem cohort by use of immunohistochemistry for specific markers of inflammation, gliosis, acute neuronal injury due to hypoxia, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, enabling the generation of hypotheses about potential mechanisms of death in SUDEP. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the expression of 6 markers (CD163, human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related, glial fibrillary acid protein, hypoxia-inducible factor-1$\alpha$ [HIF-1$\alpha$], immunoglobulin G, and albumin) in the hippocampus, amygdala, and medulla in 58 postmortem cases: 28 SUDEP (definite and probable), 12 epilepsy controls, and 18 nonepileptic sudden death controls. A semiquantitative measure of immunoreactivity was scored for all markers used, and quantitative image analysis was carried out for selected markers. RESULTS: Immunoreactivity was observed for all markers used within all studied brain regions and groups. Immunoreactivity for inflammatory reaction, BBB leakage, and HIF-1$\alpha$ in SUDEP cases was not different from that seen in control groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a starting point to explore by immunohistochemistry the mechanisms underlying SUDEP in human brain tissue. Our approach highlights the potential and importance of considering immunohistochemical analysis to help identify biomarkers of SUDEP. Our results suggest that with the markers used, there is no clear immunohistochemical signature of SUDEP in human brain.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Because the d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) product of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1(mut)) is released by tumor cells into the microenvironment and is structurally similar to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, we sought to determine whether IDH1(mut) increases the risk of seizures in patients with glioma, and whether D2HG increases the electrical activity of neurons. METHODS: Three WHO grade II-IV glioma cohorts from separate institutions (total N = 712) were retrospectively assessed for the presence of preoperative seizures and tumor location, WHO grade, 1p/19q codeletion, and IDH1(mut) status. Rat cortical neurons were grown on microelectrode arrays, and their electrical activity was measured before and after treatment with exogenous D2HG, in the presence or absence of the selective NMDA antagonist, AP5. RESULTS: Preoperative seizures were observed in 18\%-34\% of IDH1 wild-type (IDH1(wt)) patients and in 59\%-74\% of IDH1(mut) patients (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis, including WHO grade, 1p/19q codeletion, and temporal lobe location, showed that IDH1(mut) was an independent correlate with seizures (odds ratio 2.5, 95\% confidence interval 1.6-3.9, p < 0.001). Exogenous D2HG increased the firing rate of cultured rat cortical neurons 4- to 6-fold, but was completely blocked by AP5. CONCLUSIONS: The D2HG product of IDH1(mut) may increase neuronal activity by mimicking the activity of glutamate on the NMDA receptor, and IDH1(mut) gliomas are more likely to cause seizures in patients. This has rapid translational implications for the personalized management of tumor-associated epilepsy, as targeted IDH1(mut) inhibitors may improve antiepileptic therapy in patients with IDH1(mut) gliomas.",

abstract = "Objective: To identify all cases of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) among people in Sweden during 1 year and to determine the SUDEP incidence in relation to age, sex, and psychiatric comorbidity. Methods: We included all individuals with a hospital-based ambulatory care or hospital discharge diagnosis of epilepsy in the Swedish National Patient Registry during 1998--2005 who were alive on January 1, 2008. Deaths during 2008 were identified by linkage to the National Cause of Death Registry. Death certificates, medical charts, and police and autopsy reports were extensively reviewed to identify SUDEP cases. Results: Of 57,775 epilepsy patients alive on January 1, 2008, 1,890 died (3.3\%) during 2008. Of these, 99 met the Annegers SUDEP criteria (49 definite, 19 probable, and 31 possible). SUDEP accounted for 5.2\% of all deaths and 36\% of deaths in the 0--15 years age group. The incidence of definite/probable SUDEP was 1.20/1,000 person-years, and higher in men (1.41) than in women (0.96). All SUDEP cases 50 years was 1.11, 1.13, and 1.29, respectively, per 1,000 person-years. The incidence was 5-fold increased among female patients with psychiatric comorbidities compared to those without. Epilepsy was mentioned on the death certificate in only 62 of the 99 (63\%) SUDEP cases. Conclusions: Methods relying on death certificates underestimate SUDEP incidence. SUDEP risk has been underestimated especially in boys and in older people regardless of sex. Patients with psychiatric comorbidities, women in particular, are at increased SUDEP risk.

METHODS: Adults with medication-resistant focal epilepsy (n = 66) were recruited from 3 centers and randomized to 1 of 2 interventions: (1) progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) with diaphragmatic breathing, or (2) control focused-attention activity with extremity movements. Following an 8-week baseline period, participants began 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. Daily self-reported mood and stress ratings plus seizure counts were completed by participants using an electronic diary, and no medication adjustments were permitted. The primary outcome was percent reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days comparing baseline and treatment; secondary outcomes included stress reduction and stress-seizure interaction. RESULTS: In the 66 participants in the intention-to-treat analysis, seizure frequency was reduced from baseline in both treatment groups (PMR: 29\%, p < 0.05; focused attention: 25\%, p < 0.05). PMR and focused attention did not differ in seizure reduction (p = 0.38), although PMR was associated with stress reduction relative to focused attention (p < 0.05). Daily stress was not a predictor of seizures.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: While epilepsy studies rarely examine brainstem, we sought to examine the hypothesis that temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) leads to subcortical arousal center dysfunction, contributing to neocortical connectivity and neurocognitive disturbances. METHODS: In this case-control study of 26 adult patients with TLE and 26 controls, we used MRI to measure structural and functional connectivity of the cuneiform/subcuneiform nuclei (CSC), pedunculopontine nucleus, and ventral tegmental area. Ascending reticular activating system connectivity patterns were related to neuropsychological and disease measures. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with TLE demonstrated reductions in ascending reticular activating system structural and functional connectivity, most prominently to neocortical regions (p < 0.05, unpaired t tests, corrected). While reduced CSC structural connectivity was related to impaired performance IQ and visuospatial memory, diminished CSC functional connectivity was associated with impaired verbal IQ and language abilities (p < 0.05, Spearman $\rho$, t tests). Finally, CSC structural connectivity decreases were quantitatively associated with consciousness-impairing seizure frequency (p < 0.05, Spearman $\rho$) and the presence of generalized seizures (p < 0.05, unpaired t test), suggesting a relationship to disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Connectivity perturbations in brainstem arousal centers are present in TLE and may contribute to neurocognitive problems. These studies demonstrate the underappreciated role of brainstem networks in epilepsy and may lead to novel neuromodulation targets to treat or prevent deleterious brain network effects of seizures in TLE.",

People who died of SUDEP were more likely to have nocturnal convulsive seizures in general (77\% of cases vs 33\% of controls, p < 0.001) and a higher frequency of nocturnal convulsive seizures. Total SUDEP incidence was 3.53/1,000 patient-years (95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.73-4.53). The incidence differed among centers: 2.21/1,000 patient-years (95\% CI 1.49-3.27) vs 6.12/1,000 patient-years (95\% CI 4.40-8.52). There was no significant difference in nocturnal supervision among cases and controls, but there was a difference among centers: the center with a lowest grade of supervision had the highest incidence of SUDEP. CONCLUSIONS: Having nocturnal seizures, in particular convulsions, may increase SUDEP risk. Different levels of nocturnal supervision may account for some of the difference in incidence.",

Factors determining recovery of SpO2 $\geq$ 90\% were investigated using Cox proportional hazards models. Association between SpO2 nadir and person- or seizure-specific variables was analyzed after correction for individual effects and the varying number of seizures.Results A total of 107 GCS in 73 patients were analyzed. A transient hypoxemia was observed in 92 GCS (86\%). Rate of GCS with SpO2 p = 0.046). Early recovery of SpO2 $\geq$90\% was associated with early administration of oxygen (p = 0.004), absence of postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) (p = 0.014), and extratemporal lobe epilepsy (p = 0.001). Lack of early administration of O2 (p = 0.003), occurrence of PGES (p = 0.018), and occurrence of ictal hypoxemia during the focal phase (p = 0.022) were associated with lower SpO2 nadir.Conclusion Postictal hypoxemia was observed in the immediate aftermath of nearly all GCS but administration of oxygen had a strong preventive effect. Severity of postictal hypoxemia was greater in temporal lobe epilepsy and when hypoxemia was already observed before the onset of secondary GCS.",

Video-EEG, thoracoabdominal excursions, nasal airflow, capillary oxygen saturation, and ECG were analyzed.Results We studied 148 GCS in 87 patients. Nineteen patients had generalized epilepsy; 65 had focal epilepsy; 1 had both; and the epileptogenic zone was unknown in 2. Ictal central apnea (ICA) preceded GCS in 49 of 121 (40.4\%) seizures in 23 patients, all with focal epilepsy. Postconvulsive central apnea (PCCA) occurred in 31 of 140 (22.1\%) seizures in 22 patients, with generalized, focal, or unknown epileptogenic zones. In 2 patients, PCCA occurred concurrently with asystole (near-SUDEP), with an incidence rate of 10.2 per 1,000 patient-years. One patient with PCCA died of probable SUDEP during follow-up, suggesting a SUDEP incidence rate 5.1 per 1,000 patient-years. No cases of laryngospasm were detected. Rhythmic muscle artifact synchronous with breathing was present in 75 of 147 seizures and related to stertorous breathing (odds ratio 3.856, 95\% confidence interval 1.395--10.663, p = 0.009).Conclusions PCCA occurred in both focal and generalized epilepsies, suggesting a different pathophysiology from ICA, which occurred only in focal epilepsy. PCCA was seen in 2 near-SUDEP cases and 1 probable SUDEP case, suggesting that this phenomenon may serve as a clinical biomarker of SUDEP. Larger studies are needed to validate this observation. Rhythmic postictal muscle artifact is suggestive of post-GCS breathing effort rather than a specific biomarker of laryngospasm.",

METHODS: Participants comprised 152 adults: 79 patients with TLE and 73 healthy controls. Patients and controls did not differ in age, sex, or education (p > 0.05). Sixty-two percent of patients had an MRI-resolvable lesion (39\% with presumed hippocampal sclerosis [HS-TLE], 61\% with a lesion other than HS [MRI-positive TLE]); the remaining 38\% of patients were lesion-negative. Psychometric measures well established in epilepsy were used. RESULTS: Relative to controls, all 3 patient subgroups showed significantly impaired autobiographical, verbal, and visual memory (p 0.05). Lower Full-Scale IQ predicted memory impairments across all TLE subtypes, with early age at seizure onset a predictor unique to MRI-negative TLE. CONCLUSIONS: MRI-negative TLE is associated with memory and mood dysfunction equivalent to that seen in patients with hippocampal sclerosis and other MRI-resolvable pathologies. As such, neuropsychological impairments in TLE are not contingent on a macroscopic lesion and might be an intrinsic property of the underlying network disease.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To precisely identify cortical regions that modulate breathing, and delineate a network of cortical structures that underpin ictal central apnea (ICA) during epileptic seizures. METHODS: We electrically stimulated multiple cortical structures in patients undergoing stereotactic EEG (SEEG) evaluation before epilepsy surgery. Structures investigated were orbitofrontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate and subcallosal gyri, insula, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, temporo-polar cortex, antero-mesial fusiform gyrus, and lateral and basal temporal cortices. Chest/abdominal excursions using thoracic/abdominal belts, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, end tidal and transcutaneous carbon dioxide, and airflow were continuously monitored. RESULTS: Nineteen consecutive adult patients (10 female) aged 18-69 years were investigated. Transient central apnea was elicited in 13/19 patients with amygdala, hippocampus head and body, anterior parahippocampal gyrus, and antero-mesial fusiform gyrus. Insula, cingulate, subcallosal, orbitofrontal, lateral, and basal temporal cortices stimulation did not induce apnea. Apnea duration was associated with stimulus duration (p < 0.001) and current intensity (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a limbic/paralimbic mesial temporal breathing modulation network that includes amygdala, hippocampus, anterior parahippocampal, and antero-mesial fusiform gyri. These structures likely represent anatomical and functional substrates for ICA, a putative sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) breathing biomarker. Damage to such areas is known to occur in high SUDEP risk patients and SUDEP victims, and may underpin the prolonged ICA that is thought to be particularly dangerous. Furthermore, inclusive targeting of apnea-producing structures in SEEG implantations, peri-ictal breathing signal recordings, and stringent analysis of apneic sequences in seizure semiology may enhance accurate identification of symptomatogenic and seizure onset zones for epilepsy surgery.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To obtain medical records, family interviews, and death-related reports of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) cases to better understand SUDEP. METHODS: All cases referred to the North American SUDEP Registry (NASR) between October 2011 and June 2018 were reviewed; cause of death was determined by consensus review. Available medical records, death scene investigation reports, autopsy reports, and next-of-kin interviews were reviewed for all cases of SUDEP. Seizure type, EEG, MRI, and SUDEP classification were adjudicated by 2 epileptologists. RESULTS: There were 237 definite and probable cases of SUDEP among 530 NASR participants. SUDEP decedents had a median age of 26 (range 1-70) years at death, and 38\% were female. In 143 with sufficient information, 40\% had generalized and 60\% had focal epilepsy. SUDEP affected the full spectrum of epilepsies, from benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (n = 3, 1\%) to intractable epileptic encephalopathies (n = 27, 11\%). Most (93\%) SUDEPs were unwitnessed; 70\% occurred during apparent sleep; and 69\% of patients were prone. Only 37\% of cases of SUDEP took their last dose of antiseizure medications (ASMs). Reported lifetime generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) were <10 in 33\% and 0 in 4\%. CONCLUSIONS: NASR participants commonly have clinical features that have been previously been associated with SUDEP risk such as young adult age, ASM nonadherence, and frequent GTCS. However, a sizeable minority of SUDEP occurred in patients thought to be treatment responsive or to have benign epilepsies. These results emphasize the importance of SUDEP education across the spectrum of epilepsy severities. We aim to make NASR data and biospecimens available for researchers to advance SUDEP understanding and prevention.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine hippocampal morphometric measures, including granule cell dispersion and features of malrotation, as potential biomarkers for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) from an archival postmortem series. METHODS: In a retrospective study of 187 archival postmortems from 3 groups, SUDEP (68; 14 with hippocampal sclerosis [HS]), non-SUDEP epilepsy controls (EP-C = 66; 25 with HS), and nonepilepsy controls (NEC = 53), Nissl/hematoxylin \& eosin-stained sections from left and right hippocampus from 5 coronal levels were digitized. Image analysis was carried out for granule cell layer (GCL) thickness and measurements of hippocampal dimensions (HD) for shape (width [HD1], height [HD2]) and medial hippocampal positioning in relation to the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) length (HD3). A qualitative evaluation of hippocampal malrotational (HMAL) features, dentate gyrus invaginations (DGI), and subicular/CA1 folds (SCF) was also made. RESULTS: GCL thickness was increased in HS more than those without (p < 0.001). In non-HS cases, increased GCL thickness was noted in EP-C compared to NEC (p < 0.05) but not between SUDEP and NEC. There was no difference in the frequency of DGI, SCF, measurements of hippocampal shape (HD1, HD2, or ratio), or medial positioning among SUDEP, EP-C, and NEC groups, when factoring in HS, coronal level, and age at death. Comparison between left and right sides within cases showed greater PHG lengths (HD3) on the right side in the SUDEP group only (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: No hippocampal morphometric features were identified in support of either excessive granule cell dispersion or features of HMAL as definitive biomarkers for SUDEP. Asymmetries in PHG measurements in SUDEP warrant further investigation as they may indicate abnormal central autonomic networks.",

METHODS: We prospectively evaluated video EEG, plethysmography, capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), and ECG for 49 patients (49 seizures) enrolled in a multicenter study of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Postictal and interictal venous blood samples were collected after a clinical seizure for measurement of serum 5-HT levels. Seizures were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy 2017 seizure classification. We analyzed seizures with and without ICA (n = 49) and generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) with and without PCCA (n = 27). RESULTS: Postictal serum 5-HT levels were increased over interictal levels for seizures without ICA (p = 0.01), compared to seizures with ICA (p = 0.21). In patients with GCS without PCCA, serum 5-HT levels were increased postictally compared to interictal levels (p < 0.001), but not in patients with seizures with PCCA (p = 0.22). Postictal minus interictal 5-HT levels also differed between the 2 groups with and without PCCA (p = 0.03). Increased heart rate was accompanied by increased serum 5-HT levels (postictal minus interictal) after seizures without PCCA (p = 0.03) compared to those with PCCA (p = 0.42). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that significant seizure-related increases in serum 5-HT levels are associated with a lower incidence of seizure-related breathing dysfunction, and may reflect physiologic changes that confer a protective effect against deleterious phenomena leading to SUDEP.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: We conducted a nationwide case-control study in Sweden to test the hypothesis that specific clinical characteristics are associated with increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). METHODS: The study included 255 SUDEP cases (definite and probable) and 1,148 matched controls. Clinical information was obtained from medical records and the National Patient Register. The association between SUDEP and potential risk factors was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) and interaction assessed by attributable proportion due to interaction (AP). RESULTS: Experiencing generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) during the preceding year was associated with a 27-fold increased risk (OR 26.81, 95\% CI 14.86-48.38), whereas no excess risk was seen in those with exclusively non-GTCS seizures (OR 1.15, 95\% CI 0.54-48.38). The presence of nocturnal GTCS during the last year of observation was associated with a 15-fold risk (OR 15.31, 95\% CI 9.57-24.47). Living alone was associated with a 5-fold increased risk of SUDEP (OR 5.01, 95\% CI 2.93-8.57) and interaction analysis showed that the combination of not sharing a bedroom and having GTCS conferred an OR of 67.10 (95\% CI 29.66-151.88), with AP estimated at 0.69 (CI 0.53-0.85). Among comorbid diseases, a previous diagnosis of substance abuse or alcohol dependence was associated with excess risk of SUDEP. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with GTCS who sleep alone have a dramatically increased SUDEP risk.

We identified all decedents for whom epilepsy/seizure was listed as cause/contributor to death or comorbid condition on the death certificate. We then reviewed all available reports.

METHODS: Evolution of SpO2 after 1,352 DES was analyzed in 75 patients with refractory focal epilepsy who underwent stereo-EEG recordings. For each DES, we assessed the change in SpO2 from 30 seconds prior to DES onset to 120 seconds following the end of the DES. The primary outcome was occurrence of stimulation-induced transient hypoxemia as defined by decrease of SpO2 $\geq$5\% within 60 seconds after stimulation onset as compared to pre-DES SpO2 or SpO2 nadir <90\% during at least 5 seconds. Localization of the stimulated contacts was defined according to MarsAtlas brain parcellation and Freesurfer segmentation. RESULTS: A stimulation-induced transient hypoxemia was observed after 16 DES (1.2\%) in 10 patients (13\%), including 6 in whom SpO2 nadir was <90\%. Among these 16 DES, 7 (44\%) were localized within the perisylvian cortex. After correction for individual effects and the varying number of DES contributed by each person, significant decrease of SpO2 was significantly associated with the localization of DES (p = 0.019).

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that patients diagnosed with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) on video-EEG monitoring (VEM) have increased mortality by comparison to the general population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients evaluated in VEM units of 3 tertiary hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2015. Diagnosis was based on consensus opinion of experienced epileptologists and neuropsychiatrists at each hospital. Mortality was determined in patients diagnosed with PNES, epilepsy, or both conditions by linkage to the Australian National Death Index. Lifetime history of psychiatric disorders in PNES was determined from formal neuropsychiatric reports. RESULTS: A total of 5,508 patients underwent VEM. A total of 674 (12.2\%) were diagnosed with PNES, 3064 (55.6\%) with epilepsy, 175 (3.2\%) with both conditions, and 1,595 (29.0\%) received other diagnoses or had no diagnosis made. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of patients diagnosed with PNES was 2.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-3.3). Those younger than 30 had an 8-fold higher risk of death (95\% CI 3.4-19.8). Direct comparison revealed no significant difference in mortality rate between diagnostic groups. Among deaths in patients diagnosed with PNES (n = 55), external causes contributed 18\%, with 20\% of deaths in those younger than 50 years attributed to suicide, and ``epilepsy'' was recorded as the cause of death in 24\%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with PNES have a SMR 2.5 times above the general population, dying at a rate comparable to those with drug-resistant epilepsy.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine time trends and distinguishing autopsy findings of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in the U.S. METHODS: We identified the decedents where epilepsy/seizure was listed as cause/contributor to death, or comorbid condition on death certificate among all decedents who underwent medico-legal investigation at three medical examiner (ME) offices across the country: New York City (2009-2016), San Diego County (2008-2016), and Maryland (2000-2016). After reviewing all available reports, deaths classified as definite/probable/near SUDEP or SUDEP plus were included for analysis. Mann-Kendall trend test was used to analyze temporal trends in SUDEP rate for 2009-2016. Definite SUDEPs were compared to sex- and age $\pm$ 2 years-matched non-SUDEP deaths with a history of epilepsy regarding autopsy findings, circumstances, and comorbidities. RESULTS: 1086 SUDEP cases were identified. There was a decreasing trend in ME-investigated SUDEP incidence between 2009-2016 (z= -2.2 S= -42 p= 0.028) among three regions. There was a 28\% reduction in ME-investigated SUDEP incidence from 2009-2012 to 2013-2016 (CI: 17\%-38\%, p<0.0001). We found no correlation between SUDEP rates and the month of year or day of week. There was no difference between SUDEP and non-SUDEP deaths regarding neurodevelopmental abnormalities, pulmonary congestion/edema, and myocardial fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: There was a decreasing monotonic trend in ME-investigated SUDEP incidence over eight years, with a 28\% reduction in incidence from 2009-2012 to 2013-2016. Unlike SIDS and sudden cardiac death, we found no correlation between SUDEP and the season of year or day of week. No autopsy findings distinguished SUDEP from non-SUDEP deaths.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Prospectively evaluate safety and efficacy of brain-responsive neurostimulation in adults with medically intractable focal onset seizures (FOS) over 9 years. METHODS: Adults treated with brain-responsive neurostimulation within 2 year feasibility or randomized controlled trials enrolled into a long-term prospective open label trial (LTT) to assess safety, efficacy, and quality of life (QOL) over an additional 7 years. Safety was assessed as adverse events (AEs), efficacy as median percent change in seizure frequency and responder rate, and QOL using the quality of life in epilepsy (QOLIE-89) inventory. RESULTS: 230 of 256 patients treated in the initial trials participated in the LTT. At 9 years, the median percent reduction in seizure frequency was 75\% (p<0.0001; Wilcoxon Signed Rank), responder rate was 73\%, and 35\% had a $\geq$90\% reduction in seizure frequency. 18.4\% (47/256) experienced $\geq$1 year of seizure freedom with 62\% (29/47) seizure free at last follow-up and an average seizure-free period of 3.2 years (range: 1.04 - 9.6 years). Overall QOL, epilepsy-targeted and cognitive domains of QOLIE-89 remained significantly improved (p<0.05). There were no serious AEs related to stimulation and the sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) rate was significantly lower than predefined comparators (p<0.05; one-tailed Chi Square). CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive brain-responsive neurostimulation provides significant and sustained reductions in the frequency of FOS with improved QOL. Stimulation was well tolerated, implant related AEs were typical of other neurostimulation devices, and SUDEP rates were low. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that brain-responsive neurostimulation significantly reduces focal seizures with acceptable safety over 9 years.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Since the strongest risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is frequent bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (BTCSs), our aim was to determine whether postictal hypoperfusion in brainstem respiratory centres (BRCs) is more common following tonic-clonic seizures. METHODS: We studied 21 patients with focal epilepsies who underwent perfusion imaging with arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Subtraction maps of cerebral blood flow were obtained from the postictal and baseline scans. We identified six regions of interest in the brainstem that contain key BRCs. Patients were considered to have postictal BRC hypoperfusion if any of the six regions of interest were significantly hypoperfused. RESULTS: All six patients who experienced bilateral tonic-clonic seizures during the study had significant clusters of postictal hypoperfusion in BRCs compared to seven who had focal impaired awareness seizures (7/15). The association between seizure type studied and the presence of BRC hypoperfusion was significant. Duration of epilepsy and frequency of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures were not associated with postictal brainstem hypoperfusion despite also being associated with risk for SUDEP. CONCLUSION: Postictal hypoperfusion in brainstem respiratory centres occurs more often following bilateral tonic-clonic seizures than other seizure types, providing a possible explanation for the increased risk of SUDEP in patients who regularly experience bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: We conducted a nationwide case-control study in Sweden to test the hypothesis that antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) mono- or polytherapy, adherence, antidepressants, neuroleptics, $\beta$-blockers, and statins are associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk. METHODS: Included were 255 SUDEP cases and 1,148 matched controls. Information on clinical factors and medications came from medical records and the National Patient and Prescription Registers. The association between SUDEP and medications was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for potential risk factors including type of epilepsy, living conditions, comorbidity, and frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). RESULTS: Polytherapy, especially taking 3 or more AEDs, was associated with a substantially reduced risk of SUDEP (OR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.14-0.67). Combinations including lamotrigine (OR 0.55, 95\% CI 0.31-0.97), valproic acid (OR 0.53, 95\% CI 0.29-0.98), and levetiracetam (OR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.27-0.90) were associated with reduced risk. No specific AED was associated with increased risk. Regarding monotherapy, although numbers were limited, the lowest SUDEP risk was seen in users of levetiracetam (0.10, 95\% CI 0.02-0.61). Having nonadherence mentioned in the medical record was associated with an OR of 2.75 (95\% CI 1.58-4.78). Statin use was associated with a reduced SUDEP risk (OR 0.34, 95\% CI 0.11-0.99) but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use was not. CONCLUSION: These results provide support for the importance of medication adherence and intensified AED treatment for patients with poorly controlled GTCS in the effort to reduce SUDEP risk and suggest that comedication with statins may reduce risk.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a tool for individualised prediction of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) risk, we re-analysed data from one cohort and three case-control studies undertaken 1980-2005. METHODS: We entered 1273 epilepsy cases (287 SUDEP, 986 controls) and 22 clinical predictor variables into a Bayesian logistic regression model. RESULTS: Cross-validated individualized model predictions were superior to baseline models developed from only average population risk or from generalised tonic-clonic seizure frequency (pairwise difference in leave-one-subject-out expected log posterior density = 35.9, SEM +/-12.5, and 22.9, SEM +/-11.0 respectively). The mean cross-validated (95\% Credibility Interval) Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve was 0.71 (0.68 to 0.74) for our model versus 0.38 (0.33 to 0.42) and 0.63 (0.59 to 0.67) for the baseline average and generalised tonic-clonic seizure frequency models respectively. Model performance was weaker when applied to non-represented populations. Prognostic factors included generalized tonic-clonic and focal-onset seizure frequency, alcohol excess, younger age of epilepsy onset and family history of epilepsy. Anti-seizure medication adherence was associated with lower risk. CONCLUSIONS: Even when generalised to unseen data, model predictions are more accurate than population-based estimates of SUDEP. Our tool can enable risk-based stratification for biomarker discovery and interventional trials. With further validation in unrepresented populations it may be suitable for routine individualized clinical decision-making. Clinicians should consider assessment of multiple risk factors, and not only focus on the frequency of convulsions.",

For transcriptomics analyses, we evaluated hippocampus and temporal cortex surgical brain tissue from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients: 6 low-risk and 8 high-risk SUDEP as determined by a short (< 50 seconds) or prolonged ($\geq$ 50 seconds) postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) that may indicate severely depressed brain activity impairing respiration, arousal, and protective reflexes. RESULTS: In autopsy hippocampus and cortex, we observed no proteomic differences between SUDEP and non-SUDEP epilepsy patients, contrasting with our previously reported robust differences between epilepsy and non-epilepsy control patients. Transcriptomics in hippocampus and cortex from surgical epilepsy patients segregated by PGES identified 55 differentially expressed genes (37 protein-coding, 15 lncRNAs, three pending) in hippocampus. CONCLUSION: The SUDEP proteome and high-risk SUDEP transcriptome were similar to other epilepsy patients in hippocampus and frontal cortex, consistent with diverse epilepsy syndromes and comorbidities associated with SUDEP.

abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mortality is increased in epilepsy, but the important issue is that a proportion of epilepsy-related death is potentially preventable by optimized therapy and needs therefore to be identified. A new systematic classification of epilepsy-related mortality has been suggested by Devinsky et al. in 2016 to identify these preventable deaths. We applied this classification to an analysis of premature mortality in persons with epilepsy younger than 50 years. METHODS: The study was a population-based retrospective cohort of all Danish citizens with and without epilepsy aged 1-49 years during 2007-2009. Information on all deaths was retrieved from the Danish Cause of Death Registry, autopsy reports, death certificates, and the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary cause of death in persons with epilepsy was evaluated independently by three neurologist, one neuro-pediatrician, and two cardiologists. In case of uncertainty a pathologist was consulted. All deaths were classified as either epilepsy- or not-epilepsy-related, and the underlying causes or modes of death were compared between persons with and without epilepsy. RESULTS: During the study period 700 deaths were identified in persons with epilepsy, and 440 (62.9\%) of these were epilepsy-related, hereof, 169 (38\%) directly related to seizures and 181 (41\%) due to an underlying neurological disease. SUDEP accounted for 80\% of deaths directly related to epilepsy. Aspiration pneumonia was the cause of death in 80\% of cases indirectly related to epilepsy.Compared with the background population, persons with epilepsy had a nearly four-fold increased all-cause mortality (adjusted mortality hazard ratio of 3.95 [95\% CI 3.64-4.27], p<0.0001) and a higher risk of dying from various underlying causes including alcohol-related conditions (hazard ratio of 2.91 [95\% CI 2.23-3.80], p<0.0001) and suicide (hazard ratio of 2.10 [95\% CI 1.18-3.73], p=0.01). DISCUSSION: The newly proposed classification for mortality in persons with epilepsy was useful in an unselected nationwide cohort. It helped classifying unnatural causes of death as epilepsy-related or not, and it helped identifying potentially preventable deaths. The leading causes of premature mortality in persons younger than 50 years were related to epilepsy and were thus potentially preventable by good seizure control.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily seen in females, most with a mutation in MECP2. Epilepsy has been reported in 50\%-80\%. Previous reports were based on small sample sizes or parent-completed questionnaires, or failed to consider the impact of specific MECP2 mutations. METHODS: The Rare Disease Consortium Research Network for RTT is an NIH-funded project to characterize the clinical spectrum and natural history of RTT in advance of clinical trials. Evaluations include clinical status (classic vs atypical RTT), MECP2 mutations, clinical severity, and presence, frequency, and treatment of seizures. RESULTS: Enrollment as of June 2008 is 602; 528 (88\%) meet clinical criteria for classic RTT. Of these, 493 (93\%) have MECP2 mutations. Age range was 8 months to 64 years. A total of 360 (60\%) were reported to have seizures, including 315 (60\%) classic and 45 (61\%) atypical RTT. Physician assessment of the 602 indicated that 48\% had seizures. There was no significant difference in seizure occurrence by race/ethnicity. A significant age impact for seizures was seen and seizures were infrequent before age 2 years. MECP2 mutations most frequently associated with epilepsy were T158M (74\%) and R106W (78\%), and less frequently R255X and R306C (both 49\%). Individuals with seizures had greater overall clinical severity, and greater impairment of ambulation, hand use, and communication. DISCUSSION: Seizures are common in Rett syndrome, have an age-related onset and occurrence, vary by mutation, and are associated with greater clinical severity. This information represents a key consideration for designing clinical trials.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) poses a poorly understood but considerable risk to people with uncontrolled epilepsy. There is controversy regarding the significance of postictal generalized EEG suppression as a biomarker for SUDEP risk, and it remains unknown whether postictal EEG suppression has a neurologic correlate. Here, we examined the profile of autonomic alterations accompanying seizures with a wrist-worn biosensor and explored the relationship between autonomic dysregulation and postictal EEG suppression. METHODS: We used custom-built wrist-worn sensors to continuously record the sympathetically mediated electrodermal activity (EDA) of patients with refractory epilepsy admitted to the long-term video-EEG monitoring unit. Parasympathetic-modulated high-frequency (HF) power of heart rate variability was measured from concurrent EKG recordings. RESULTS: A total of 34 seizures comprising 22 complex partial and 12 tonic-clonic seizures from 11 patients were analyzed. The postictal period was characterized by a surge in EDA and heightened heart rate coinciding with persistent suppression of HF power. An increase in the EDA response amplitude correlated with an increase in the duration of EEG suppression (r = 0.81, p = 0.003). Decreased HF power correlated with an increase in the duration of EEG suppression (r = -0.87, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The magnitude of both sympathetic activation and parasympathetic suppression increases with duration of EEG suppression after tonic-clonic seizures. These results provide autonomic correlates of postictal EEG suppression and highlight a critical window of postictal autonomic dysregulation that may be relevant in the pathogenesis of SUDEP.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine the consistency and facilitating cofactors of postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) of >20 seconds after convulsive seizures (CS), a suggested predictor of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy risk. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed video-EEG data of people with $\geq$2 recorded CS. Presence and duration of PGES were assessed by 2 independent observers blinded to patient status. Intraindividual consistency of PGES >20 seconds was determined and correlations with clinical characteristics were analyzed after correction for individual effects and the varying number of seizures. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four seizures in 59 people were analyzed. PGES >20 seconds was found in 37 individuals (63\%) and 57 (37\%) of CS. The proportion of persons in whom PGES occurred consistently (presence or absence of PGES >20 seconds in all CS) was lower in those with more CS. PGES of >20 seconds was more frequent in seizures arising from sleep (odds ratio 3.29, 95\% confidence interval 1.21-8.96) and when antiepileptic medication was tapered (odds ratio 4.80, 95\% confidence interval 1.27-18.14). CONCLUSION: Apparent PGES consistency was less frequent in people with more CS recorded, suggesting that PGES is an inconsistent finding in any one individual. Thus, we believe that PGES >20 seconds is not a reliable predictor of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Sleep and antiepileptic drug reduction appear to facilitate the occurrence of PGES.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the lateralization and localization of ictal EEG in focal epilepsy. METHODS: A total of 486 ictal EEG of 72 patients with focal epilepsy arising from the mesial temporal, neocortical temporal, mesial frontal, dorsolateral frontal, parietal, and occipital regions were analyzed. RESULTS: Surface ictal EEG was adequately localized in 72\% of cases, more often in temporal than extratemporal epilepsy. Localized ictal onsets were seen in 57\% of seizures and were most common in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), lateral frontal lobe epilepsy (LFLE), and parietal lobe epilepsy, whereas lateralized onsets predominated in neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy and generalized onsets in mesial frontal lobe epilepsy (MFLE) and occipital lobe epilepsy. Approximately two-thirds of seizures were localized, 22\% generalized, 4\% lateralized, and 6\% mislocalized/lateralized. False localization/lateralization occurred in 28\% of occipital and 16\% of parietal seizures. Rhythmic temporal theta at ictal onset was seen exclusively in temporal lobe seizures, whereas localized repetitive epileptiform activity was highly predictive of LFLE. Seizures arising from the lateral convexity and mesial regions were differentiated by a high incidence of repetitive epileptiform activity at ictal onset in the former and rhythmic theta activity in the latter. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of mesial frontal lobe epilepsy, ictal recordings are very useful in the localization/lateralization of focal seizures. Some patterns are highly accurate in localizing the epileptogenic lobe. One limitation of ictal EEG is the potential for false localization/lateralization in occipital and parietal lobe epilepsies.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the feasibility, safety, and usefulness of depth electrodes stereotactically implanted within the insular cortex. METHODS: Thirty patients with suspected insular involvement during epileptic seizure underwent presurgical stereotactic electroencephalographic recordings using 10 to 16 depth electrodes per patient. Among these, one or two electrodes were implanted via an oblique approach to widely sample the insular cortex. RESULTS: Thirty-five insular electrodes were implanted in the 30 patients without morbidity. A total of 226 recording contacts (mean, 7.5 contacts/patient) explored the insular cortex. Stereotactic electroencephalographic recordings of seizures allowed the differentiation into groups: Group 1, 10 patients with no insular involvement; Group 2, 15 patients with secondary insular involvement; and Group 3, five patients with an initial insular involvement. In temporal epilepsy (n = 17), the insula was never involved at the seizure onset but was frequently involved during the seizures (11 out of 17). In frontotemporal or frontal epilepsy, the insula was involved at the onset of seizure in five out of 13 patients. All patients in Groups 1 and 2 underwent surgery, with a seizure-free outcome in 76.2\% of patients. In Group 3, only two of the five patients underwent surgery, with a poor outcome. In temporal lobe epilepsy, surgical outcome tended to be better in Group 1 compared with Group 2 in this small series: results were good in 83.3\% (Engel I) versus 72.7\%. CONCLUSION: Insula can be safely explored with oblique electrodes. In temporal lobe epilepsy, insular involvement does not significantly modify the short-term postoperative outcome. Future larger studies are necessary to clarify the long-term prognostic value of insular spread.",

author = "Ljungberg, M Cecilia and Sunnen, C Nicole and Lugo, Joaquin N and Anderson, Anne E and D'Arcangelo, Gabriella",
abstract = "Malformations of the cerebral cortex known as cortical dysplasia account for the majority of cases of intractable childhood epilepsy. With the exception of the tuberous sclerosis complex, the molecular basis of most types of cortical dysplasia is completely unknown. Currently, there are no good animal models available that recapitulate key features of the disease, such as structural cortical abnormalities and seizures, hindering progress in understanding and treating cortical dysplasia. At the neuroanatomical level, cortical abnormalities may include dyslamination and the presence of abnormal cell types, such as enlarged and misoriented neurons and neuroglial cells. Recent studies in resected human brain tissue suggested that a misregulation of the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-Akt-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway might be responsible for the excessive growth of dysplastic cells in this disease. Here, we characterize neuronal subset (NS)-Pten mutant mice as an animal model of cortical dysplasia. In these mice, the Pten gene, which encodes a suppressor of the PI3K pathway, was selectively disrupted in a subset of neurons by using Cre-loxP technology. Our data indicate that these mutant mice, like cortical dysplasia patients, exhibit enlarged cortical neurons with increased mTOR activity, and abnormal electroencephalographic activity with spontaneous seizures. We also demonstrate that a short-term treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin strongly suppresses the severity and the duration of the seizure activity. These findings support the possibility that this drug may be developed as a novel antiepileptic treatment for patients with cortical dysplasia and similar disorders.",

But what if we are trying to model a disorder with a phenotype that appears only sporadically and briefly, like epileptic seizures? The purpose of this Review is to highlight the challenges of modelling epilepsy, in which the most obvious manifestation of the disorder, seizures, occurs only intermittently, possibly very rarely and often at times when the mice are not under direct observation. Over time, researchers have developed a number of ways in which to overcome these challenges, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. In this Review, we describe the genetics of epilepsy and the ways in which genetically altered mouse models have been used. We also discuss the use of induced models in which seizures are brought about by artificial stimulation to the brain of wild-type animals, and conclude with the ways these different approaches could be used to develop a wider range of anti-seizure medications that could benefit larger patient populations.",

author = "Derera, Isabel Diane",
abstract = "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that is characterized by aberrant electrical activity in the brain resulting in at least two unprovoked seizures over a period longer than 24 hours. Approximately 60\% of individuals with epilepsy are diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and about one third of those individuals do not respond well to anti-seizure medications. This places those individuals at high risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is defined as when an individual with epilepsy, who is otherwise healthy, dies suddenly and unexpectedly for unknown reasons. SUDEP is one of the leading causes of death in individuals with acquired epilepsies (i.e. not due to genetic mutations), such as TLE. Previous studies utilizing genetic models of epilepsy have suggested that circuitry within the vagal complex of the brainstem may play a role in SUDEP risk. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) within the vagal complex receive, filter, and modulate cardiorespiratory information from the vagus nerve. GABAergic NTS neurons then project to cardiac vagal motor neurons, eventually effecting parasympathetic output to the periphery. In this study, a mouse model of TLE was used to assess the effect of epileptogenesis on GABAergic NTS neuron function and determine if functional alterations in these neurons impact SUDEP risk. It was discovered that mice with TLE (i.e. TLE mice) have significantly increased mortality rates compared to control animals, suggesting that SUDEP occurs in this model. Using whole cell electrophysiology synaptic and intrinsic properties of GABAergic NTS neurons were investigated in TLE and control mice. Results suggest that during epileptogenesis, GABAergic NTS neurons become hyperexcitable, potentially due to a reduction in A-type potassium channel current and increased excitatory synaptic input. Increases in hyperexcitability have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of spreading depolarization and action potential inactivation leading to neuronal quiescence. This may lead to a decreased inhibition of parasympathetic tone, causing cardiorespiratory collapse and SUDEP in TLE.",

author = "Hawkins, Nicole A and Zachwieja, Nicole J and Miller, Alison R and Anderson, Lyndsey L and Kearney, Jennifer A",
abstract = "A substantial number of mutations have been identified in voltage-gated sodium channel genes that result in various forms of human epilepsy. SCN1A mutations result in a spectrum of severity ranging from mild febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome, an infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Dravet syndrome patients experience multiple seizures types that are often refractory to treatment, developmental delays, and elevated risk for SUDEP. The same sodium channel mutation can produce epilepsy phenotypes of varying clinical severity. This suggests that other factors, including genetic, modify the primary mutation and change disease severity. Mouse models provide a useful tool in studying the genetic basis of epilepsy. The mouse strain background can alter phenotype severity, supporting a contribution of genetic modifiers in epilepsy. The Scn1a+/- mouse model has a strain-dependent epilepsy phenotype. Scn1a+/- mice on the 129S6/SvEvTac (129) strain have a normal phenotype and lifespan, while [129xC57BL/6J]F1-Scn1a+/- mice experience spontaneous seizures, hyperthermia-induced seizures and high rates of premature death. We hypothesize the phenotypic differences are due to strain-specific genetic modifiers that influence expressivity of the Scn1a+/- phenotype. Low resolution mapping of Scn1a+/- identified several Dravet syndrome modifier (Dsm) loci responsible for the strain-dependent difference in survival. One locus of interest, Dsm1 located on chromosome 5, was fine mapped to a 9 Mb region using interval specific congenics. RNA-Seq was then utilized to identify candidate modifier genes within this narrowed region. Three genes with significant total gene expression differences between 129S6/SvEvTac and [129xC57BL/6J]F1 were identified, including the GABAA receptor subunit, Gabra2. Further analysis of Gabra2 demonstrated allele-specific expression. Pharmological manipulation by clobazam, a common anticonvulsant with preferential affinity for the GABRA2 receptor, revealed dose-dependent protection against hyperthermia-induced seizures in Scn1a+/- mice. These findings support Gabra2 as a genetic modifier of the Scn1a+/- mouse model of Dravet syndrome.",

Although no novel genes were implicated in this initial analysis, PVNH cases were found overall to have a significant excess of nonsynonymous de novo variants in intolerant genes (p = 3.27x10-7), suggesting a role for rare new alleles in genes yet to be associated with the condition. Using a gene-level collapsing analysis comparing cases and controls, we identified a genome-wide significant signal driven by four ultra-rare loss-of-function heterozygous variants in MAP1B, including one de novo variant. In at least one instance, the MAP1B variant was inherited from a parent with previously undiagnosed PVNH. The PVNH was frontally predominant and associated with perisylvian polymicrogyria.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Seizures are the main cause of maternal death in women with epilepsy, but there are no tools for predicting seizures in pregnancy. We set out to develop and validate a prognostic model, using information collected during the antenatal booking visit, to predict seizure risk at any time in pregnancy and until 6 weeks postpartum in women with epilepsy on antiepileptic drugs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used datasets of a prospective cohort study (EMPiRE) of 527 pregnant women with epilepsy on medication recruited from 50 hospitals in the UK (4 November 2011-17 August 2014). The model development cohort comprised 399 women whose antiepileptic drug doses were adjusted based on clinical features only; the validation cohort comprised 128 women whose drug dose adjustments were informed by serum drug levels. The outcome was epileptic (non-eclamptic) seizure captured using diary records. We fitted the model using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression, and reported the performance using C-statistic (scale 0-1, values > 0.5 show discrimination) and calibration slope (scale 0-1, values near 1 show accuracy) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We determined the net benefit (a weighted sum of true positive and false positive classifications) of using the model, with various probability thresholds, to aid clinicians in making individualised decisions regarding, for example, referral to tertiary care, frequency and intensity of monitoring, and changes in antiepileptic medication. Seizures occurred in 183 women (46\%, 183/399) in the model development cohort and in 57 women (45\%, 57/128) in the validation cohort. The model included age at first seizure, baseline seizure classification, history of mental health disorder or learning difficulty, occurrence of tonic-clonic and non-tonic-clonic seizures in the 3 months before pregnancy, previous admission to hospital for seizures during pregnancy, and baseline dose of lamotrigine and levetiracetam. The C-statistic was 0.79 (95\% CI 0.75, 0.84). On external validation, the model showed good performance (C-statistic 0.76, 95\% CI 0.66, 0.85; calibration slope 0.93, 95\% CI 0.44, 1.41) but with imprecise estimates. The EMPiRE model showed the highest net proportional benefit for predicted probability thresholds between 12\% and 99\%. Limitations of this study include the varied gestational ages of women at recruitment, retrospective patient recall of seizure history, potential variations in seizure classification, the small number of events in the validation cohort, and the clinical utility restricted to decision-making thresholds above 12\%. The model findings may not be generalisable to low- and middle-income countries, or when information on all predictors is not available. CONCLUSIONS: The EMPiRE model showed good performance in predicting the risk of seizures in pregnant women with epilepsy who are prescribed antiepileptic drugs. Integration of the tool within the antenatal booking visit, deployed as a simple nomogram, can help to optimise care in women with epilepsy.",

abstract = "Pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats provide a widely animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Some evidences reported in the literature suggest that at least 1 h of status epilepticus (SE) is required to produce subsequent chronic phase, due to the SE-related acute neuronal damage. However, recent data seems to indicate that neuro-inflammation plays a crucial role in epileptogenesis, modulating secondarily a neuronal insult. For this reason, we decided to test the following hypotheses: a) whether pilocarpine-injected rats that did not develop SE can exhibit long-term chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and b) whether acute neurodegeneration is mandatory to obtain chronic epilepsy. Therefore, we compared animals injected with the same dose of pilocarpine that developed or did not SE, and saline treated rats. We used telemetric acquisition of EEG as long-term monitoring system to evaluate the occurrence of seizures in non-SE pilocarpineinjected animals. Furthermore, histology and MRI analysis were applied in order to detect neuronal injury and neuropathological signs. Our observations indicate that non-SE rats exhibit SRS almost 8 (+/22) months after pilocarpine-injection, independently to the absence of initial acute neuronal injury. This is the first time reported that pilocarpine injected rats without developing SE, can experience SRS after a long latency period resembling human pathology. Thus, we strongly emphasize the important meaning of including these animals to model human epileptogenesis in pilocarpine induced epilepsy.",

Cannabinoids appear to be anti-convulsive in patients and animal models of TLE, but the mechanisms of this effect are not known. A pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus mouse model of TLE was used to study the effect of cannabinoid agonists on recurrent excitatory circuits of the dentate gyrus using electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices isolated from control mice and mice with TLE. Cannabinoid agonists WIN 55,212-2, anandamide (AEA), or 2-arachydonoylglycerol (2-AG) reduced the frequency of spontaneous and tetrodotoxin-resistant excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in mice with TLE, but not in controls. WIN 55,212-2 also reduced the frequency of EPSCs evoked by glutamate-photolysis activation of other granule cells in epileptic mice. Secondary population discharges evoked after antidromic electrical stimulation of mossy fibers in the hilus were also attenuated by cannabinoid agonists. Agonist effects were blocked by the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) antagonist AM251. No change in glutamate release was observed in slices from mice that did not undergo status epilepticus. Western blot analysis suggested an up-regulation of CB1R in the dentate gyrus of animals with TLE. These findings indicate that activation of CB1R present on nerve terminals can suppress recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus of mice with TLE. This suggests a mechanism for the anti-convulsive role of cannabinoids aimed at modulating receptors on synaptic terminals expressed de novo after epileptogenesis.",

abstract = "Background Exposure to early postnatal stress is known to hasten the progression of kindling epileptogenesis in adult rats. Despite the significance of this for understanding mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and its associated psychopathology, research findings regarding underlying mechanisms are sparse. Of several possibilities, one important candidate mechanism is early life `programming' of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by postnatal stress. Elevated corticosterone (CORT) in turn has consequences for neurogenesis and cell death relevant to epileptogenesis. Here we tested the hypotheses that MS would augment seizure-related corticosterone (CORT) release and enhance neuroplastic changes in the hippocampus. Methodology/Principal Findings Eight-week old Wistar rats, previously exposed on postnatal days 2--14 to either maternal separation stress (MS) or control brief early handling (EH), underwent rapid amygdala kindling. We measured seizure-induced serum CORT levels and post-kindling neurogenesis (using BrdU). Three weeks post-kindling, rats were euthanized for histology of the hippocampal CA3c region (pyramidal cell counts) and dentate gyrus (DG) (to count BrdU-labelled cells and measure mossy fibre sprouting). As in our previous studies, rats exposed to MS had accelerated kindling rates in adulthood. Female MS rats had heightened CORT responses during and after kindling (p<0.05), with a similar trend in males. In both sexes total CA3c pyramidal cell numbers were reduced in MS vs. EH rats post-kindling (p = 0.002). Dentate granule cell neurogenesis in female rats was significantly increased post-kindling in MS vs. EH rats. Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrate that early life stress results in enduring enhancement of HPA axis responses to limbic seizures, with increased hippocampal CA3c cell loss and augmented neurogenesis, in a sex-dependent pattern. This implicates important candidate mechanisms through which early life stress may promote vulnerability to limbic epileptogenesis in rats as well as to human MTLE and its associated psychiatric disorders.",

Using the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy we examined the expression pattern of the Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1-R) in the hippocampi of CD1 mice at survival times of 2 hours, 1 day, 3 days and 2 months (acute, latent and chronic phases). Based on the behavioral signs of the acute seizures, animals were classified as ``weakly'' or ``strongly'' epileptic using the modified Racine scale. Mice of the weak group had mild seizures, whereas seizures in the strong group were frequent with intense motor symptoms and the majority of these animals developed sclerosis in the chronic phase. In control samples the most intense staining of CB1-R-positive fibers was found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in str. pyramidale of the cornu Ammonis. In weak animals no significant changes were seen at any survival time compared to controls. In strong animals, however, in the acute phase, a massive reduction in CB1-R-stained terminals occurred in the hippocampus. In the latent phase CB1-R immunoreactivity gradually recovered. In the chronic phase, CB1-immunostaining in sclerotic samples was stronger throughout the hippocampus. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis showed an increase in the number of CB1-R-positive terminals in the dentate gyrus. Moreover, the number of immunogold particles significantly increased in GABAergic terminals. Our results suggest a proconvulsive downregulation of CB1 receptors in the acute phase most probably due to receptor internalization, followed by compensatory upregulation and sprouting in the chronic phase of epilepsy. In conclusion, the changes in CB1 receptor expression pattern revealed in this study are associated with the severity of hippocampal injury initiated by acute seizures that ultimately leads to sclerosis in the vulnerable regions in the chronic phase.",

Remarkably, octanal triggered a striking and involuntary phenotype in these animals, with passive exposure regularly inducing seizures. Octanal exposure invariably resulted in widespread activation of OSNs but interestingly seizures only occurred in 30-40\% of trials. We hypothesized that this reflects the need for the olfactory system to filter strong but slowly-changing backgrounds from salient signals. Therefore we used an olfactometer to control octanal delivery and demonstrated suppression of responses whenever this odorant is delivered slowly. By contrast, rapid exposure of the mice to octanal induced seizure in every trial. Our results expose new details of olfactory processing and provide a robust and non-invasive platform for studying epilepsy.",

abstract = "Stress is the most commonly reported precipitating factor for seizures in patients with epilepsy. Despite compelling anecdotal evidence for stress-induced seizures, animal models of the phenomena are sparse and possible mechanisms are unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that increased levels of the stress-associated hormone corticosterone (CORT) would increase epileptiform activity and spontaneous seizure frequency in mice rendered epileptic following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. We monitored video-EEG activity in pilocarpine-treated mice 24/7 for a period of four or more weeks, during which animals were serially treated with CORT or vehicle. CORT increased the frequency and duration of epileptiform events within the first 24 hours of treatment, and this effect persisted for up to two weeks following termination of CORT injections. Interestingly, vehicle injection produced a transient spike in CORT levels -- presumably due to the stress of injection -- and a modest but significant increase in epileptiform activity. Neither CORT nor vehicle treatment significantly altered seizure frequency; although a small subset of animals did appear responsive. Taken together, our findings indicate that treatment of epileptic animals with exogenous CORT designed to mimic chronic stress can induce a persistent increase in interictal epileptiform activity.",

abstract = "Early life stress results in an enduring vulnerability to kindling-induced epileptogenesis in rats, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Recent studies indicate the involvement of thalamocortical neuronal circuits in the progression of kindling epileptogenesis. Therefore, we sought to determine in vivo the effects of early life stress and amygdala kindling on the firing pattern of hippocampus as well as thalamic and cortical neurons. Eight week old male Wistar rats, previously exposed to maternal separation (MS) early life stress or early handling (EH), underwent amygdala kindling (or sham kindling). Once fully kindled, in vivo juxtacellular recordings in hippocampal, thalamic and cortical regions were performed under neuroleptic analgesia. In the thalamic reticular nucleus cells both kindling and MS independently lowered firing frequency and enhanced burst firing. Further, burst firing in the thalamic reticular nucleus was significantly increased in kindled MS rats compared to kindled EH rats (p<0.05). In addition, MS enhanced burst firing of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Following a stimulation-induced seizure, somatosensory cortical neurons exhibited a more pronounced increase in burst firing in MS rats than in EH rats. These data demonstrate changes in firing patterns in thalamocortical and hippocampal regions resulting from both MS and amygdala kindling, which may reflect cellular changes underlying the enhanced vulnerability to kindling in rats that have been exposed to early life stress.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of intractable pediatric epilepsy with a high incidence of SUDEP: Sudden Unexpected Death in epilepsy. Cardiac arrhythmias are a proposed cause for some cases of SUDEP, yet the susceptibility and potential mechanism of arrhythmogenesis in Dravet syndrome remain unknown. The majority of Dravet syndrome patients have de novo mutations in SCN1A, resulting in haploinsufficiency. We propose that, in addition to neuronal hyperexcitability, SCN1A haploinsufficiency alters cardiac electrical function and produces arrhythmias, providing a potential mechanism for SUDEP. METHODS: Postnatal day 15-21 heterozygous SCN1A-R1407X knock-in mice, expressing a human Dravet syndrome mutation, were used to investigate a possible cardiac phenotype. A combination of single cell electrophysiology and in vivo electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were performed. RESULTS: We observed a 2-fold increase in both transient and persistent Na(+) current density in isolated Dravet syndrome ventricular myocytes that resulted from increased activity of a tetrodotoxin-resistant Na(+) current, likely Nav1.5. Dravet syndrome myocytes exhibited increased excitability, action potential duration prolongation, and triggered activity. Continuous radiotelemetric ECG recordings showed QT prolongation, ventricular ectopic foci, idioventricular rhythms, beat-to-beat variability, ventricular fibrillation, and focal bradycardia. Spontaneous deaths were recorded in 2 DS mice, and a third became moribund and required euthanasia. INTERPRETATION: These data from single cell and whole animal experiments suggest that altered cardiac electrical function in Dravet syndrome may contribute to the susceptibility for arrhythmogenesis and SUDEP. These mechanistic insights may lead to critical risk assessment and intervention in human patients.",

The hippocampus and surrounding temporal lobe structures appear particularly sensitive to epileptiform activity. Somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons within the hilar region have been suggested to gate hippocampal activity, and therefore may play a crucial role in the dysregulation of hippocampal activity. In this study, we examined SST interneuron activity in the in vitro 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) model of epilepsy. We employed a multi-disciplinary approach, combining extracellular multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings with patch-clamp recordings and optical imaging using a genetically encoded calcium sensor. We observed that hilar SST interneurons are strongly synchronized during 4-AP-induced local field potentials (LFPs), as assayed by Ca(2+) imaging as well as juxtacellular or intracellular recording. SST interneurons were particularly responsive to GABA-mediated LFPs that occurred in the absence of ionotropic glutamatergic transmission. Our results present evidence that the extensive synchronized activity of SST-expressing interneurons contribute to the generation of GABAergic LFPs in an in vitro model of temporal lobe seizures.",

abstract = "Whereas corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) has been considered as the most potent epileptogenic neuropeptide in the brain, its action site and underlying mechanisms in epilepsy have not been determined. Here, we found that the entorhinal cortex (EC) expresses high level of CRF and CRF2 receptors without expression of CRF1 receptors. Bath application of CRF concentration-dependently increased the frequency of picrotoxin (PTX)-induced epileptiform activity recorded from layer III of the EC in entorhinal slices although CRF alone did not elicit epileptiform activity. CRF facilitated the induction of epileptiform activity in the presence of subthreshold concentration of PTX which normally would not elicit epileptiform activity. Bath application of the inhibitor for CRF-binding proteins, CRF6-33, also increased the frequency of PTX-induced epileptiform activity suggesting that endogenously released CRF is involved in epileptogenesis. CRF-induced facilitation of epileptiform activity was mediated via CRF2 receptors because pharmacological antagonism and knockout of CRF2 receptors blocked the facilitatory effects of CRF on epileptiform activity. Application of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitors blocked CRF-induced facilitation of epileptiform activity and elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) level by application of the AC activators or phosphodiesterase inhibitor increased the frequency of PTX-induced epileptiform activity, demonstrating that CRF-induced increases in epileptiform activity are mediated by an increase in intracellular cAMP. However, application of selective protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors reduced, not completely blocked CRF-induced enhancement of epileptiform activity suggesting that PKA is only partially required. Our results provide a novel cellular and molecular mechanism whereby CRF modulates epilepsy.",

abstract = "Administration of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine is commonly used to induce seizures in rodents for the study of epilepsy. Activation of muscarinic receptors has been previously shown to increase the production of endocannabinoids in the brain. Endocannabinoids act at the cannabinoid CB1 receptors to reduce neurotransmitter release and the severity of seizures in several models of epilepsy. In this study, we determined the effect of CB1 receptor activity on the induction in mice of seizures by pilocarpine. We found that decreased activation of the CB1 receptor, either through genetic deletion of the receptor or treatment with a CB1 antagonist, increased pilocarpine seizure severity without modifying seizure-induced cell proliferation and cell death. These results indicate that endocannabinoids act at the CB1 receptor to modulate the severity of pilocarpine-induced seizures. Administration of a CB1 agonist produced characteristic CB1-dependent behavioral responses, but did not affect pilocarpine seizure severity. A possible explanation for the lack of effect of CB1 agonist administration on pilocarpine seizures, despite the effects of CB1 antagonist administration and CB1 gene deletion, is that muscarinic receptor-stimulated endocannabinoid production is acting maximally at CB1 receptors to modulate sensitivity to pilocarpine seizures.",

In contrast, KA-SE in young animals before postnatal day (P) 18 is less likely to cause cell death or epilepsy. To investigate whether changes in neuronal excitability occur in the subiculum after KA-SE, we examined the age-dependent effects of SE on the bursting neurons of subiculum, the major output region of the hippocampus. Patch-clamp recordings were used to monitor bursting in pyramidal neurons in the subiculum of rat hippocampal slices. Neurons were studied either one or 2-3 weeks following injection of KA or saline (control) in immature (P15) or more mature (P30) rats, which differ in their sensitivity to KA as well as the long-term sequelae of the KA-SE. A significantly greater proportion of subicular pyramidal neurons from P15 rats were strong-bursting neurons and showed increased frequency-dependent bursting compared to P30 animals. Frequency-dependent burst firing was enhanced in P30, but not in P15 rats following KA-SE. The enhancement of bursting induced by KA-SE in more mature rats suggests that the frequency-dependent limitation of repetitive burst firing, which normally occurs in the subiculum, is compromised following SE. These changes could facilitate the initiation of spontaneous recurrent seizures or their spread from the hippocampus to other parts of the brain.",

abstract = "A variety of metabolic disorders, including complications experienced by diabetic patients, have been linked to altered neural activity in the dorsal vagal complex. This study tested the hypothesis that augmentation of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated responses in the vagal complex contributes to increased glutamate release in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV) in mice with streptozotocin-induced chronic hyperglycemia (i.e., hyperglycemic mice), a model of type 1 diabetes. Antagonism of NMDA receptors with AP-5 (100 $\mu$M) suppressed sEPSC frequency in vagal motor neurons recorded in vitro, confirming that constitutively active NMDA receptors regulate glutamate release in the DMV. There was a greater relative effect of NMDA receptor antagonism in hyperglycemic mice, suggesting that augmented NMDA effects occur in neurons presynaptic to the DMV. Effects of NMDA receptor blockade on mEPSC frequency were equivalent in control and diabetic mice, suggesting that differential effects on glutamate release were due to altered NMDA function in the soma-dendritic membrane of intact afferent neurons. Application of NMDA (300 $\mu$M) resulted in greater inward current and current density in NTS neurons recorded from hyperglycemic than control mice, particularly in glutamatergic NTS neurons identified by single-cell RT-PCR for VGLUT2. Overall expression of NR1 protein and message in the dorsal vagal complex were not different between the two groups. Enhanced postsynaptic NMDA responsiveness of glutamatergic NTS neurons is consistent with tonically-increased glutamate release in the DMV in mice with chronic hyperglycemia. Functional augmentation of NMDA-mediated responses may serve as a physiological counter-regulatory mechanism to control pathological disturbances of homeostatic autonomic function in type 1 diabetes.",

abstract = "The goal of this study was to determine whether a substantial decrease in adult neurogenesis influences epileptogenesis evoked by the intra-amygdala injection of kainic acid (KA). Cyclin D2 knockout (cD2 KO) mice, which lack adult neurogenesis almost entirely, were used as a model. First, we examined whether status epilepticus (SE) evoked by an intra-amygdala injection of KA induces cell proliferation in cD2 KO mice. On the day after SE, we injected BrdU into mice for 5 days and evaluated the number of DCX- and DCX/BrdU-immunopositive cells 3 days later. In cD2 KO control animals, only a small number of DCX+ cells was observed. The number of DCX+ and DCX/BrdU+ cells/mm of subgranular layer in cD2 KO mice increased significantly following SE (p<0.05). However, the number of newly born cells was very low and was significantly lower than in KA-treated wild type (wt) mice. To evaluate the impact of diminished neurogenesis on epileptogenesis and early epilepsy, we performed video-EEG monitoring of wt and cD2 KO mice for 16 days following SE. The number of animals with seizures did not differ between wt (11 out of 15) and cD2 KO (9 out of 12) mice. The median latency to the first spontaneous seizure was 4 days (range 2-10 days) in wt mice and 8 days (range 2-16 days) in cD2 KO mice and did not differ significantly between groups. Similarly, no differences were observed in median seizure frequency (wt: 1.23, range 0.1-3.4; cD2 KO: 0.57, range 0.1-2.0 seizures/day) or median seizure duration (wt: 51 s, range 23-103; cD2 KO: 51 s, range 23-103). Our results indicate that SE-induced epileptogenesis is not disrupted in mice with markedly reduced adult neurogenesis.

Clinical data demonstrate a 30-35\% lifetime prevalence of depression in patients with epilepsy, and patients diagnosed with depression have a three to sevenfold higher risk of developing epilepsy. Traditional epilepsy models partially replicate the clinical observations, with the demonstration of depressive traits in epileptic animals. Studies assessing pro-epileptogenic changes in models of depression, however, are more limited. Here, we examined whether a traditional rodent depression model--bilateral olfactory bulbectomy--predisposes the animals towards the development of epilepsy. Past studies have demonstrated increased neuronal excitability after bulbectomy, but continuous seizure monitoring had not been conducted. For the present study, we monitored control and bulbectomized animals by video-EEG 24/7 for approximately two weeks following the surgery to determine whether they develop spontaneous seizures. All seven bulbectomized mice exhibited seizures during the monitoring period. Seizures began about one week after surgery, and occurred in clusters with severity increasing over the monitoring period. These results suggest that olfactory bulbectomy could be a useful model of TBI-induced epilepsy, with advantages of relatively rapid seizure onset and a high number of individuals developing the disease. The model may also be useful for investigating the mechanisms underlying the bidirectional relationship between epilepsy and depression.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Dopamine is an endogenous neuromodulator in cortical circuits and the basal ganglia. In animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), seizure threshold is modulated to some extent by dopamine, with D1-receptors having a pro- and D2-receptors an anticonvulsant effect. We aimed to extend our previously reported results on decreased D2/D3 receptor binding in the lateral epileptogenic temporal lobe and to correlate them with demographic and seizure variables to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying involvement of the dopaminergic system in the epileptogenesis of TLE. METHODS: To quantify D2/D3 receptor binding, we studied 21 patients with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis (13 left- and eight right-sided) and 18 controls using PET with the high-affinity dopamine D2/D3-receptor ligand 18F-Fallypride to image striatal and extrastriatal binding. TLE was defined by interictal and ictal video-EEG, MRI and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET. Voxel-based statistical and regions-of-interest analyses were performed. RESULTS: 18F-Fallypride binding potential was significantly reduced in the affected temporal lobe and bilateral putamen. A positive correlation between age at onset of epilepsy and [18F]FP BPnd (binding potential non-displaceable) in temporal regions on the epileptogenic side was found, as well as a negative correlation between epilepsy duration and [18F]FP BPnd in the temporal pole on the epileptogenic side and a positive correlation between the estimated number of lifetime GTCS and [18F]FP BPnd in the hippocampus on the epileptogenic side. SIGNIFICANCE: The areas of reduced D2/D3 receptor availability correspond to ``the irritative zone'' surrounding the epileptogenic area. Moreover, reduced D2/D3 receptor availability was detectable in the basal ganglia, which are suspected to be involved in a control circuit for epileptic seizures. The correlational analysis additionally suggests that increased epilepsy duration leads to increasing impairment of the dopaminergic system.",

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: We investigated the behavioral, respiratory, and thermoregulatory responses elicited by acute exposure to both hypercapnic and hypoxic environments in Wistar audiogenic rats (WARs). The WAR strain represents a genetic animal model of epilepsy. METHODS: Behavioral analyses were performed using neuroethological methods, and flowcharts were constructed to illustrate behavioral findings. The body plethysmography method was used to obtain pulmonary ventilation (VE) measurements, and body temperature (Tb) measurements were taken via temperature sensors implanted in the abdominal cavities of the animals. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between the WAR and Wistar control group with respect to the thermoregulatory response elicited by exposure to both acute hypercapnia and acute hypoxia (p>0.05). However, we found that the VE of WARs was attenuated relative to that of Wistar control animals during exposure to both hypercapnic (WAR: 133 $\pm$ 11\% vs. Wistar: 243 $\pm$ 23\%, p<0.01) and hypoxic conditions (WAR: 138 $\pm$ 8\% vs. Wistar: 177 $\pm$ 8\%; p<0.01). In addition, we noted that this ventilatory attenuation was followed by alterations in the behavioral responses of these animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that WARs, a genetic model of epilepsy, have important alterations in their ability to compensate for changes in levels of various arterial blood gasses. WARs present an attenuated ventilatory response to an increased PaCO2 or decreased PaO2, coupled to behavioral changes, which make them a suitable model to further study respiratory risks associated to epilepsy.",

In epilepsy, HFOs might reflect a mechanism of epileptic phenomena, serving as a biomarker of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity. Despite the valuable information provided by HFOs, their correct identification is a challenging task. A comprehensive application, RIPPLELAB, was developed to facilitate the analysis of HFOs. RIPPLELAB provides a wide range of tools for HFOs manual and automatic detection and visual validation; all of them are accessible from an intuitive graphical user interface. Four methods for automated detection-as well as several options for visualization and validation of detected events-were implemented and integrated in the application. Analysis of multiple files and channels is possible, and new options can be added by users. All features and capabilities implemented in RIPPLELAB for automatic detection were tested through the analysis of simulated signals and intracranial EEG recordings from epileptic patients (n = 16; 3,471 analyzed hours). Visual validation was also tested, and detected events were classified into different categories. Unlike other available software packages for EEG analysis, RIPPLELAB uniquely provides the appropriate graphical and algorithmic environment for HFOs detection (visual and automatic) and validation, in such a way that the power of elaborated detection methods are available to a wide range of users (experts and non-experts) through the use of this application. We believe that this open-source tool will facilitate and promote the collaboration between clinical and research centers working on the HFOs field.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) are an inbreed Wistar rat strain widely used as a model of genetic generalised epilepsy with absence seizures. As in humans, the genetic architecture that results in genetic generalized epilepsy in GAERS is poorly understood. Here we present the strain-specific variants found among the epileptic GAERS and their related Non-Epileptic Control (NEC) strain. The GAERS and NEC represent a powerful opportunity to identify neurobiological factors that are associated with the genetic generalised epilepsy phenotype. METHODS: We performed whole genome sequencing on adult epileptic GAERS and adult NEC rats, a strain derived from the same original Wistar colony. We also generated whole genome sequencing on four double-crossed (GAERS with NEC) F2 selected for high-seizing (n = 2) and non-seizing (n = 2) phenotypes. RESULTS: Specific to the GAERS genome, we identified 1.12 million single nucleotide variants, 296.5K short insertion-deletions, and 354 putative copy number variants that result in complete or partial loss/duplication of 41 genes. Of the GAERS-specific variants that met high quality criteria, 25 are annotated as stop codon gain/loss, 56 as putative essential splice sites, and 56 indels are predicted to result in a frameshift. Subsequent screening against the two F2 progeny sequenced for having the highest and two F2 progeny for having the lowest seizure burden identified only the selected Cacna1h GAERS-private protein-coding variant as exclusively co-segregating with the two high-seizing F2 rats. SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights an approach for using whole genome sequencing to narrow down to a manageable candidate list of genetic variants in a complex genetic epilepsy animal model, and suggests utility of this sequencing design to investigate other spontaneously occurring animal models of human disease.",

In the present study, 20 epilepsy patients with personal or family history of heart rhythm disturbance/cardiac arrhythmias/sudden death were sequenced using a custom re-sequencing panel. Twenty-six relatives were genetically analysed to ascertain the family segregation in ten individuals. Four subjects revealed variants with positive genotype-phenotype segregation: four missense variants in the CDKL5, CNTNAP2, GRIN2A and ADGRV1 genes and one copy number variant in KCNQ1. The potential pathogenic role of variants in new candidate genes will need further studies in larger cohorts, and the evaluation of the potential pathogenic role in the cardio-cerebral mechanisms requires in vivo/in vitro studies. In addition to family segregation, evaluation of the potential pathogenic roles of these variants in cardio-cerebral mechanisms by in vivo/in vitro studies should also be performed. The potential pathogenic role of variants in new candidate genes will need further studies in larger cohorts.",

abstract = "Reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition has been implicated in both anxiety and epilepsy. GAD65-/- (NOD/LtJ) mice have significantly decreased basal GABA levels in the brain and a lowered threshold for seizure generation. One fifth of GAD65 -/- mice experienced stress-induced seizures upon exposure to an open field at 4 weeks of age. In each successive week until 8 weeks of age, the latency to seizures decreased with prior seizure experience. 100\% of GAD65-/- mice exhibited stress-induced seizures by the end of 8 weeks. GAD65-/- mice also exhibited marked impairment in open field exploratory behavior and deficits in spatial learning acquisition on a Barnes maze. Anxiety-like behavior in an open field was observed prior to seizure onset and was predictive of subsequent seizures. Immunohistochemical characterization of interneuron subtypes in GAD65-/- mice showed a selective decrease in GABA and neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels and no change in calbindin (CLB) or calretinin (CLR) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. Stem cells from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) were injected into the hippocampal hilus to restore GABAergic interneurons. One week after transplantation, MGE-transplanted mice demonstrated significant seizure resistance compared to sham surgical controls. The percent area of GFP+ MGE graft in the hippocampus correlated significantly with the increase in seizure latency. Our data indicate that impaired GABAergic neurotransmission can cause anxiety-like behavior and stress-induced seizures that can be rescued by MGE stem cell transplantation.",

abstract = "Hyperventilation is a known feature of Rett syndrome (RTT). However, how hyperventilation is related to other RTT symptoms such as hyperexcitability is unknown. Intense breathing during hyperventilation induces hypocapnia and culminates in respiratory alkalosis. Alkalinization of extracellular milieu can trigger epilepsy in patients who already have neuronal hyperexcitability. By combining patch-clamp electrophysiology and quantitative glutamate imaging, we compared excitability of CA1 neurons of WT and Mecp2 (-/y) mice, and analyzed the biophysical properties of subthreshold membrane channels. The results show that Mecp2 (-/y) CA1 neurons are hyperexcitable in normal pH (7.4) and are increasingly vulnerable to alkaline extracellular pH (8.4), during which their excitability increased further. Under normal pH conditions, an abnormal negative shift in the voltage-dependencies of HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) and calcium channels in the CA1 neurons of Mecp2 (-/y) mice was observed. Alkaline pH also enhanced excitability in wild-type (WT) CA1 neurons through modulation of the voltage dependencies of HCN- and calcium channels. Additionally alkaline pH augmented spontaneous glutamate release and burst firing in WT CA1 neurons. Conversely, acidic pH (6.4) and 8 mM Mg2+ exerted the opposite effect, and diminished hyperexcitability in Mecp2 (-/y) CA1 neurons. We propose that the observed effects of pH and Mg2+ are mediated by changes in the neuronal membrane surface potential, which consecutively modulates the gating of HCN and calcium channels. The results provide insight to pivotal cellular mechanisms that can regulate neuronal excitability and help to devise treatment strategies for hyperexcitability induced symptoms of Rett syndrome.",

abstract = "Clinical data suggest that the neuroendocrine stress response is chronically dysregulated in a subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), potentially contributing to both disease progression and the development of psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. Whether neuroendocrine dysregulation and psychiatric comorbidities reflect direct effects of epilepsy-related pathologies, or secondary effects of disease burden particular to humans with epilepsy (i.e. social estrangement, employment changes) is not clear. Animal models provide an opportunity to dissociate these factors. Therefore, we queried whether epileptic mice would reproduce neuroendocrine and behavioral changes associated with human epilepsy. Male FVB mice were exposed to pilocarpine to induce status epilepticus (SE) and the subsequent development of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Morning baseline corticosterone levels were elevated in pilocarpine treated mice at 1, 7 and 10 weeks post-SE relative to controls. Similarly, epileptic mice had increased adrenal weight when compared to control mice. Exposure to acute restraint stress resulted in hypersecretion of corticosterone 30 min after the onset of the challenge. Anatomical analyses revealed reduced Fos expression in infralimbic and prelimbic prefrontal cortex, ventral subiculum and basal amygdala following restraint. No differences in Fos immunoreactivity were found in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, hippocampal subfields or central amygdala. In order to assess emotional behavior, a second cohort of mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests, including sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, 24h home-cage monitoring and forced swim. Epileptic mice showed increased anhedonic behavior, hyperactivity and anxiety-like behaviors. Together these data demonstrate that epileptic mice develop HPA axis hyperactivity and exhibit behavioral dysfunction. Endocrine and behavioral changes are associated with impaired recruitment of forebrain circuits regulating stress inhibition and emotional reactivity. Loss of forebrain control may underlie pronounced endocrine dysfunction and comorbid psychopathologies seen in temporal lobe epilepsy.",

METHODS: 37 patients with focal epilepsy, based on clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) data, with non-lesional MRIs at clinical field strengths and 21 healthy controls were recruited for the 7T imaging study. The MRI protocol consisted of high resolution T1-weighted, T2-weighted and susceptibility weighted imaging sequences of the entire cortex. The images were read by two neuroradiologists, who were initially blind to clinical data, and then reviewed a second time with knowledge of the seizure onset zone. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients had findings with epileptogenic potential. In five patients these were definitely related to their epilepsy, confirmed through surgical intervention, in three they co-localized to the suspected seizure onset zone and likely caused the seizures. In seven patients the imaging findings co-localized to the suspected seizure onset zone but were not the definitive cause, and ten had cortical lesions with epileptogenic potential that did not localize to the suspected seizure onset zone. There were multiple other findings of uncertain significance found in both epilepsy patients and healthy controls. The susceptibility weighted imaging sequence was instrumental in guiding more targeted inspection of the other structural images and aiding in the identification of cortical lesions. SIGNIFICANCE: Information revealed by the improved resolution and enhanced contrast provided by 7T imaging is valuable in noninvasive identification of lesions in epilepsy patients who are non-lesional at clinical field strengths.",

abstract = "This study was designed to evaluate cardiac and respiratory dysfunction in a mouse model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy i.e., SUDEP. We simultaneously monitored respiration via plethysmography and the electrocardiogram via telemetry before, during, and after an audiogenic seizure. DBA/1 mice responded to an acoustic stimulus with one or two cycles of circling and jumping before entering a clonic/tonic seizure. This was followed by death unless the mice were resuscitated by mechanical ventilation using room air. During the initial clonic phase, respiration declined and cardiac rhythm is slowed. By the tonic phase, respiration had ceased, atrial P-waves were absent or dissociated from the QRS complex, and heart rate had decreased from 771$\pm$11 to 252$\pm$16 bpm. Heart rate further deteriorated terminating in asystole unless the mice were resuscitated at the end of the tonic phase which resulted in abrupt recovery of P-waves and a return to normal sinus rhythm, associated with gasping. Interestingly, P-waves were preserved in the mice treated with methylatropine during the pre-ictal period (to block parasympathetic stimulation) and heart rate remained unchanged through the end of the tonic phase (765$\pm$8 vs. 748$\pm$21 bpm), but as in control, methylatropine treated mice died from respiratory arrest. These results demonstrate that a clonic/tonic seizure in the DBA/1 mouse results in abrupt and simultaneous respiratory and cardiac depression. Although death clearly results from respiratory arrest, our results suggest that seizure activates two central nervous system pathways in this model-one inhibits respiratory drive, whereas the other inhibits cardiac function via vagal efferents. The abrupt and simultaneous recovery of both respiration and cardiac function with mechanical ventilation within an early post-ictal timeframe shows that the vagal discharge can be rapidly terminated. Understanding the central mechanism associated with the abrupt cardiorespiratory dysfunction and equally abrupt recovery may provide clues for therapeutic targets for SUDEP.",

abstract = "Patients with epilepsy, who later succumb to sudden unexpected death, show altered brain tissue volumes in selected regions. It is unclear whether the alterations in brain tissue volume represent changes in neurons or glial properties, since volumetric procedures have limited sensitivity to assess the source of volume changes (e.g., neuronal loss or glial cell swelling). We assessed a measure, entropy, which can determine tissue homogeneity by evaluating tissue randomness, and thus, shows tissue integrity; the measure is easily calculated from T1-weighted images. T1-weighted images were collected with a 3.0-Tesla MRI from 53 patients with tonic-clonic (TC) seizures and 53 healthy controls; images were bias-corrected, entropy maps calculated, normalized to a common space, smoothed, and compared between groups (TC patients and controls using ANCOVA; covariates, age and sex; SPM12, family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons, p<0.01). Decreased entropy, indicative of increased tissue homogeneity, appeared in major autonomic (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, dorsal and ventral medulla, deep cerebellar nuclei), motor (sensory and motor cortex), or both motor and autonomic regulatory sites (basal-ganglia, ventral-basal cerebellum), and external surfaces of the pons. The anterior and posterior thalamus and midbrain also showed entropy declines. Only a few isolated regions showed increased entropy. Among the spared autonomic regions was the anterior cingulate and anterior insula; the posterior insula and cingulate were, however, affected. The entropy alterations overlapped areas of tissue changes found earlier with volumetric measures, but were more extensive, and indicate widespread injury to tissue within critical autonomic and breathing regulatory areas, as well as prominent damage to more-rostral sites that exert influences on both breathing and cardiovascular regulation. The entropy measures provide easily-collected supplementary information using only T1-weighted images, showing aspects of tissue integrity other than volume change that are important for assessing function.",

abstract = "Recent technical developments have transformed how neuroscientists can probe brain function. What was once thought to be difficult and perhaps impossible, stimulating a single set of long range inputs among many, is now relatively straight-forward using optogenetic approaches. This has provided an avalanche of data demonstrating causal roles for circuits in a variety of behaviors. However, despite the critical role that neuropeptide signaling plays in the regulation of behavior and physiology of the brain, there have been remarkably few studies demonstrating how peptide release is causally linked to behaviors. This is likely due to both the different time scale by which peptides act on and the modulatory nature of their actions. For example, while glutamate release can effectively transmit information between synapses in milliseconds, peptide release is potentially slower [See the excellent review by Van Den Pol on the time scales and mechanisms of release ()] and it can only tune the existing signals via modulation. And while there have been some studies exploring mechanisms of release, it is still not as clearly known what is required for efficient peptide release. Furthermore, this analysis could be complicated by the fact that there are multiple peptides released, some of which may act in contrast. Despite these limitations, there are a number of groups making progress in this area. The goal of this review is to explore the role of peptide signaling in one specific structure, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, that has proven to be a fertile ground for peptide action.",

Fluctuations in neurosteroid concentrations are important in the regulation of a number of physiological responses including anxiety and stress, reproductive, and sexual behaviors. These effects are mediated in part by the direct binding of neurosteroids to $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type-A receptors (GABAARs), resulting in the potentiation of GABAAR-mediated currents. Extrasynaptic GABAARs containing the $\delta$ subunit, which contribute to the tonic conductance, are particularly sensitive to low nanomolar concentrations of neurosteroids and are likely their preferential target. Considering the large charge transfer generated by these persistently open channels, even subtle changes in neurosteroid concentrations can have a major impact on neuronal excitability. Consequently, aberrant levels of neurosteroids have been implicated in numerous disorders, including, but not limited to, anxiety, neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol abuse, epilepsy, and depression.

These abnormalities could affect membrane excitability and lead to overstimulation of neurons. Multiple overlapping processes refer to neural homeostatic responses develop in neurons that work together to restore neuronal firing rates to control levels. Nevertheless, homeostatic mechanisms are unable to restore normal neuronal excitability, and the epileptic hippocampus becomes hyperexcitable or hypoexcitable. Studies show that there is hyperexcitability even before starting recurrent spontaneous seizures, suggesting although hippocampal hyperexcitability may contribute to epileptogenesis, it alone is insufficient to produce epileptic seizures. This supports the concept that the hippocampus is not the only substrate for limbic seizure onset, and a broader hyperexcitable limbic structure may contribute to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) seizures. Nevertheless, seizures also occur in conditions where the hippocampus shows a hypoexcitable phenotype. Since TLE seizures most often originate in the hippocampus, it could therefore be assumed that both hippocampal hypoexcitability and hyperexcitability are undesirable states that make the epileptic hippocampal network less stable and may, under certain conditions, trigger seizures.",

The rapid advances in automated seizure detection and prediction algorithms provide a fundamental framework for their adaption in predicting SUDEP. If a SUDEP can be predicted, then there will be a potential for medical intervention to be administered, either by their caregivers or via an implanted device automatically delivering electrical stimulation or medication, and finally save lives from fatal seizures.

Although the CA3 region of the hippocampus has been suggested to be crucial for kainic acid-induced seizure, because of its strong expression of kainate glutamate receptors and its high degree of recurrent connectivity, the precise role of excitatory transmission in CA3 in the generation of seizure and the accompanying increase in neuronal oscillations remains largely untested.

abstract = "High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are an intriguing potential biomarker for epilepsy, typically categorized according to peak frequency as either ripples (100-250 Hz) or fast ripples (>250 Hz). In the hippocampus, fast ripples were originally thought to be more specific to epileptic tissue, but it is still very di cult to distinguish which HFOs are caused by normal versus pathological brain activity. In this study we use a computational model of hippocampus to investigate possible network mechanisms underpinning normal ripples, pathological ripples, and fast ripples. Our results unify several prior findings regarding HFO mechanisms, and also make several new predictions regarding abnormal HFOs. We show that HFOs are generic, emergent phenomena whose characteristics reflect a wide range of connectivity and network input. Although produced by di erent mechanisms, both normal and abnormal HFOs generate similar ripple frequencies, underscoring that peak frequency is unable to distinguish the two. Abnormal ripples are generic phenomena that arise when input to pyramidal cells overcomes network inhibition, resulting in high-frequency, uncoordinated firing. In addition, fast ripples transiently and sporadically arise from the precise conditions that produce abnormal ripples. Lastly, we show that such abnormal conditions do not require any specific network structure to produce coherent HFOs, as even completely asynchronous activity is capable of producing abnormal ripples and fast ripples in this manner. These results provide a generic, network-based explanation for the link between pathological ripples and fast ripples, and a unifying description for the entire spectrum from normal ripples to pathological fast ripples.",

abstract = "Mutations in a voltage-gated sodium channel (SCN1A) result in Dravet Syndrome (DS), a catastrophic childhood epilepsy. Zebrafish with a mutation in scn1Lab recapitulate salient phenotypes associated with DS, including seizures, early fatality, and resistance to antiepileptic drugs. To discover new drug candidates for the treatment of DS, we screened a chemical library of ∼1000 compounds and identified 4 compounds that rescued the behavioral seizure component, including 1 compound (dimethadione) that suppressed associated electrographic seizure activity. Fenfluramine, but not huperzine A, also showed antiepileptic activity in our zebrafish assays. The effectiveness of compounds that block neuronal calcium current (dimethadione) or enhance serotonin signaling (fenfluramine) in our zebrafish model suggests that these may be important therapeutic targets in patients with DS. Over 150 compounds resulting in fatality were also identified. We conclude that the combination of behavioral and electrophysiological assays provide a convenient, sensitive, and rapid basis for phenotype-based drug screening in zebrafish mimicking a genetic form of epilepsy.",

author = "Ning, Yao and Noebels, Jeffrey L and Aiba, Isamu",
abstract = "The Emx1-IRES-Cre transgenic mouse is commonly used to direct genetic recombination in forebrain excitatory neurons. However, the original study reported that Emx1-Cre is also expressed embryonically in peripheral autonomic ganglia, which could potentially affect the interpretation of targeted circuitry contributing to systemic phenotypes. Here, we report that Emx1-Cre is expressed in the afferent vagus nerve system involved in autonomic cardiorespiratory regulatory pathways. Our imaging studies revealed expression of Emx1-Cre driven tdtomato fluorescence in the afferent vagus nerve innervating the dorsal medulla of brainstem, cell bodies in the nodose ganglion, and their potential target structures at the carotid bifurcation such as the carotid sinus and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Photostimulation of the afferent terminals in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in vitro using Emx1-Cre driven ChR2 reliably evoked EPSCs in the postsynaptic neurons with electrophysiological characteristics consistent with the vagus afferent nerves. In addition, optogenetic stimulation targeting the Emx1-Cre expressing structures identified in this study, such as vagus nerve, carotid bifurcation, and the dorsal medulla surface transiently depressed cardiorespiratory rate in urethane anesthetized mice in vivo Together, our study demonstrates that Emx1-IRES-Cre is expressed in the key peripheral autonomic nerve system and can modulate cardiorespiratory function independently of forebrain expression. These results raise caution when interpreting systemic phenotypes of Emx1-IRES-Cre conditional recombinant mice, and also suggest the utility of this line to investigate modulators of the afferent vagal system.",

author = "Spampanato, Jay and Dudek, F Edward",
abstract = "The death of GABAergic interneurons has long been hypothesized to contribute to acquired epilepsy. These experiments tested the hypothesis that focal interneuron lesions cause acute seizures [i.e., status epilepticus (SE)] and/or chronic epilepsy [i.e., persistent spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs)]. To selectively ablate interneurons,Gad2-ires-Cremice were injected unilaterally in the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocampus with an adeno-associated virus containing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR). Simultaneously, an electrode, connected to a miniature telemetry device, was positioned at the injection site for chronic recordings of local field potentials (LFPs). Two weeks after virus transfection, intraperitoneal injection of DT consistently caused focal, specific, and extensive ablation of interneurons. Long-term, continuous monitoring revealed that all mice with DT-induced interneuron lesions had SRSs. Seizures lasted tens of seconds and interseizure intervals were several hours (or days); therefore, these interneuron lesions did not induce SE. The SRSs occurred 3-5 d after DT treatment, which is the estimated time required for DT-induced cell death; therefore, induction of SRSs occurred without the latent period typical of acquired epilepsy. In five of six DT-treated mice, SRSs stopped within days, suggesting that the DT-induced interneuron lesions did not usually cause epilepsy. In one mouse, however, SRSs occurred for $\geq$34 d after interneuron ablation, similar to epilepsy after experimental SE. Sham control mice had no detectable seizures, confirming that the SRSs were due to ablation of interneurons. These data show that selective interneuron ablation consistently caused SRSs but not SE; and, at least under the conditions used here, interneuron lesions rarely led to persistent SRSs (i.e., epilepsy).",

abstract = "Both the basal amygdala (BA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) can participate in contextual fear, but it is unclear if contextual fear engrams involve a direct interaction between these two brain regions. To determine if dorsal BNST (dBNST)-projecting neurons in the BA participate in contextual fear engrams, we combined the TetTag mouse with a retrograde tracer to label dBNST-projecting cells in the BA. We identified a population of neurons located in the anterior subdivision of the BA that was activated during fear conditioning and reactivated during retrieval, but that did not project to the dBNST. In contrast, dBNST-projecting neurons located in the posterior BA were activated during contextual fear conditioning, but were not reactivated during retrieval. Similarly, we found neurons in the oval BNST subdivision (ovBNST) that were activated during contextual fear conditioning without being reactivated during retrieval. However, the anterodorsal BNST subdivision (adBNST) was not activated during either contextual fear conditioning or retrieval, underscoring the divergent functionality of these two dBNST subdivisions. Finally, we found that the ovBNST receives a monosynaptic projection from neurons located in the BA. Our results indicate that anterior BA neurons that do not project to the dBNST participate in contextual fear engrams. In contrast, dBNST-projecting neurons in the BA do not appear to participate in contextual fear engrams, but might instead contain a BA $\rightarrow$ ovBNST pathway that is active during the initial encoding of contextual fear memories.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Both the basal amygdala (BA) and the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST) can participate in contextual fear, but it is unclear if this reflects a direct interaction between these two brain regions.

abstract = "Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, including in epilepsy research. However, rats and mice are social animals; and individual housing constitutes a stressful situation. The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of individual housing as compared to conditions maintaining social contact on stress markers and epilepsy. Control male mice socially housed during pretest and then transferred to individual cages for six weeks displayed anhedonia, increased anxiety and biological markers of stress as compared to pretest values or mice kept socially housed during six weeks. Pilocarpine (pilo)-treated mice housed together showed increased levels of anhedonia, anxiety and stress markers as well as decreased cognitive performance as compared to the control group. The differences were more significant in pilo-treated mice housed individually. Anxiety correlated linearly with cognitive performance and stress markers independently of the experimental conditions. In the male rat pilo model, seizures were sixteen times more frequent in singly housed animals as compared to animals kept in pairs. Daily interactions with an experimenter in otherwise singly housed animals was sufficient to produce results identical to those found in animals kept in pairs. We propose that social isolation produces a severe phenotype in terms of stress and seizure frequency as compared to animals maintaining social contact (at least in these two models), a factor that needs to be taken into account for data interpretation, in particular for preclinical studies.",

While the amygdala is necessary for context and cued fear conditioning, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for anxiety-like behavior and conditioned responses to diffuse and/or unpredictable threats. However, we still lack knowledge about how the BNST and amygdala nuclei act in coordination. Moreover, the incidence of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is substantially higher in women than in men, but most studies of fear conditioning are conducted in male rodents. Here, we asked whether the BNST and the lateral, basal, and central nuclei of the amygdala are active during the expression of fear conditioning in male and female rats using FOS immunohistochemistry. We first show that the BNST is indeed involved in context fear expression in males, but not in females. The lateral amygdala was active in both sexes during context fear expression. We next trained animals using tone cues paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), or tone cues which were unpaired with the US, and thus nonpredictive. Females displayed greater fear expression to these unpaired tones than males. FOS was upregulated in both the BNST and the basal amygdala during fear expression to unpaired tones in both sexes. The differential processing of fear responses by males and females highlights the need to acknowledge sex differences in conditioned fear memory.",

abstract = "Objective: Dravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with an increased incidence of sudden death. Evidence of interictal breathing deficits in DS suggests that alterations in subcortical projections to brainstem nuclei may exist, which might be driving comorbidities in DS. The aim of this study was to determine if a subcortical structure, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the extended amygdala, is activated by seizures, exhibits changes in excitability, and expresses any alterations in neurons projecting to a brainstem nucleus associated with respiration, stress response and homeostasis.Methods: Experiments were conducted using F1 mice generated by breeding 129.Scn1a+/- mice with wildtype C57BL/6J mice. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify neuronal c-fos activation in DS mice after observed spontaneous seizures. Whole cell patch clamp and current clamp electrophysiology recordings were conducted to evaluate changes in intrinsic and synaptic excitability in the BNST.Results: Spontaneous seizures in DS mice significantly enhanced neuronal c-fos expression in the BNST. Further, the BNST had altered AMPA/NMDA postsynaptic receptor composition and showed changes in spontaneous neurotransmission, with greater excitation and decreased inhibition. BNST to parabrachial nucleus (PBN) projection neurons exhibited intrinsic excitability in wildtype mice, while these projection neurons were hypoexcitable in DS mice.Significance: The findings suggest that there is altered excitability in neurons of the BNST, including BNST to PBN projection neurons, in DS mice. These alterations could potentially be driving comorbid aspects of DS outside of seizures, including respiratory dysfunction and sudden death.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDravet syndrome (DS) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with an increased risk of sudden death. We determined that there are alterations in a subcortical nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) of the extended amygdala, in a murine DS model.

We found enhanced activation in the BNST after seizures and alterations in basal synaptic neurotransmission-with enhanced spontaneous excitatory and decreased spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic events. Evaluating those neurons that project to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), a nucleus with multiple homeostatic roles, we found them to be hypoexcitable in DS.

abstract = "Genetic mutations in nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2) are associated with a wide spectrum of familial focal epilepsies, autism, and sudden unexpected death of epileptics (SUDEP), but the mechanisms by which NPRL2 contributes to these effects are not well known. NPRL2 is a requisite subunit of the Gap Activity TOward Rags 1 (GATOR1) complex, which functions as a negative regulator of mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase when intracellular amino acids are low. Here we show that loss of NPRL2 expression in mouse excitatory glutamatergic neurons causes seizures prior to death, consistent with SUDEP in humans with epilepsy. Additionally, the absence of NPRL2 expression increases mTORC1-dependent signal transduction and significantly alters amino acid homeostasis in the brain. Loss of NPRL2 reduces dendritic branching and increases the strength of electrically stimulated action potentials in neurons. The increased action potential strength is consistent with elevated expression of epilepsy-linked, voltage-gated sodium channels in the NPRL2-deficient brain. Targeted deletion of NPRL2 in primary neurons increases the expression of sodium channel Scn1A, whereas treatment with the pharmacological mTORC1 inhibitor called rapamycin prevents Scn1A upregulation. These studies demonstrate a novel role of NPRL2 and mTORC1 signaling in the regulation of sodium channels, which can contribute to seizures and early lethality.Significance StatementNPRL2 is a requisite subunit of the epilepsy-linked GATOR1 complex that functions as a negative regulator of mTORC1 kinase when intracellular amino acids are limited. Here we report the generation and characterization of a new neurological model of GATOR1-dependent mTORopathy, caused by the loss of NPRL2 function in glutamatergic neurons. Loss of NPRL2 increases mTORC1 signal transduction, significantly alters amino acid homeostasis in the brain, and causes SUDEP. In addition, loss of NPRL2 increases the strength of electrically stimulated action potentials and the expression of epilepsy-linked sodium channels. These data reveal an unanticipated link between intracellular amino acid signaling by NPRL2 and a novel mTORC1-dependent regulation of sodium-channel expression in epilepsy.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in individuals with refractory acquired epilepsy. Cardiorespiratory failure is the most likely cause in most cases, and central autonomic dysfunction has been implicated as a contributing factor to SUDEP. Neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brainstem vagal complex receive and integrate vagally mediated information regarding cardiorespiratory and other autonomic functions, and GABAergic inhibitory NTS neurons play an essential role in modulating autonomic output. We assessed the activity of GABAergic NTS neurons as a function of epilepsy development in the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Compared with age-matched controls, mice that survived SE had significantly lower survival rates by 150 d post-SE. GABAergic NTS neurons from mice that survived SE displayed a glutamate-dependent increase in spontaneous action potential firing rate by 12 wks post-SE. Increased spontaneous EPSC frequency was also detected, but vagal afferent synaptic release properties were unaltered, suggesting that an increase in glutamate release from central neurons developed in the NTS after SE. Our results indicate that long-term changes in glutamate release and activity of GABAergic neurons emerge in the NTS in association with epileptogenesis. These changes might contribute to increased risk of cardiorespiratory dysfunction and sudden death in this model of TLE.",

abstract = "It is not known why there is increased risk to have seizures with increased anxiety and stress after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Stressors cause the release of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) both from the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and from CNS neurons located in the central amygdala and GABAergic interneurons. We have previously shown that CRF signaling is plastic, becoming excitatory instead of inhibitory after the kindling model of epilepsy. Here, using Sprague-Dawley rats we have found that CRF signaling increased excitability after TBI. Following TBI, CRF type 1 receptor (CRFR1) mediated activity caused abnormally large electrical responses in the amygdala including fast ripples which are considered to be epileptogenic. After TBI, we also found the ripple (120 Hz-250 Hz) and fast ripple activity (> 250 Hz) was cross frequency coupled with theta (3-8 Hz) oscillations. CRFR1 antagonists reduced the incidence of phase coupling between ripples and fast ripples. Our observations indicate that pathophysiological signaling of the CRFR1 increases the incidence of epileptiform activity after TBI. The use for CRFR1 antagonist may be useful to reduce the severity and frequency of TBI associated epileptic seizures.Significance Statement The combination of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stress is known to increase the likelihood of post traumatic epilepsy. Here we show after moderate TBI that CRF increases the excitability of a number of limbic regions in the rat. In particular a tail pinch stress causes epileptiform activity that is characterized by the occurrence of fast ripples that are phase amplitude coupled to theta rhythm. This activity is blocked by CRF receptor 1 antagonist. Our data provide a possible mechanism by which stress exacerbates epileptiform activity.",

abstract = "Hilar mossy cells (HMCs) in the hippocampus receive glutamatergic input from dentate granule cells (DGCs) via mossy fibers (MFs) and back-projections from CA3 pyramidal neuron collateral axons. Many fundamental features of these excitatory synapses have not been characterized in detail despite their potential relevance to hippocampal cognitive processing and epilepsy-induced adaptations in circuit excitability. In this study, we compared pre- and postsynaptic parameters between MF and CA3 inputs to HMCs in young and adult mice of either sex and determined the relative contributions of the respective excitatory inputs during in vitro and in vivo models of hippocampal hyperexcitability. The two types of excitatory synapses both exhibited a modest degree of short-term plasticity, with MF inputs to HMCs exhibiting lower paired-pulse (PP) and frequency facilitation than was described previously for MF-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses. MF-HMC synapses exhibited unitary excitatory synaptic currents (EPSCs) of larger amplitude, contained postsynaptic kainate receptors, and had a lower NMDA/AMPA receptor ratio compared to CA3-HMC synapses. Pharmacological induction of hippocampal hyperexcitability in vitro transformed the abundant but relatively weak CA3-HMC connections to very large amplitude spontaneous bursts of compound EPSCs (cEPSCs) in young mice (∼P20) and, to a lesser degree, in adult mice (∼P70). CA3-HMC cEPSCs were also observed in slices prepared from mice with spontaneous seizures several weeks after intrahippocampal kainate injection. Strong excitation of HMCs during synchronous CA3 activity represents an avenue of significant excitatory network generation back to DGCs and might be important in generating epileptic networks.",

abstract = "The conceptual understanding of hippocampal function has been challenged recently by the finding that new granule cells are born throughout life in the mammalian dentate gyrus (DG). The number of newborn neurons is dynamically regulated by a variety of factors. Kainic acid-induced seizures, a rodent model of human temporal lobe epilepsy, strongly induce the proliferation of DG neurogenic progenitor cells and are also associated with long-term cognitive impairment. We show here that the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) potently blocked seizure-induced neurogenesis, an effect that appeared to be mainly mediated by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDAC) and normalizing HDAC-dependent gene expression within the epileptic dentate area. Strikingly, the inhibition of aberrant neurogenesis protected the animals from seizure-induced cognitive impairment in a hippocampus-dependent learning task. We propose that seizure-generated granule cells have the potential to interfere with hippocampal function and contribute to cognitive impairment caused by epileptic activity within the hippocampal circuitry. Furthermore, our data indicate that the effectiveness of VPA as an antiepileptic drug may be partially explained by the HDAC-dependent inhibition of aberrant neurogenesis induced by seizure activity within the adult hippocampus.",

author = "Favero, Morgana and Sotuyo, Nathaniel P and Lopez, Emily and Kearney, Jennifer A and Goldberg, Ethan M",
abstract = "Dravet syndrome is a severe, childhood-onset epilepsy largely due to heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the gene SCN1A, which encodes the type 1 neuronal voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channel $\alpha$ subunit Nav1.1. Prior studies in mouse models of Dravet syndrome (Scn1a+/- mice) indicate that, in cerebral cortex, Nav1.1 is predominantly expressed in GABAergic interneurons, in particular in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cell interneurons (PVINs). This has led to a model of Dravet syndrome pathogenesis in which Nav1.1 mutation leads to preferential dysfunction of interneurons, decreased synaptic inhibition, hyperexcitability, and epilepsy. However, such studies have been implemented at early developmental time points. Here, we performed electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices prepared from male and female Scn1a+/- mice as well as age-matched wild-type littermate controls and found that, later in development, the excitability of PVINs had normalized. Analysis of action potential waveforms indirectly suggests a reorganization of axonal Na+ channels in PVINs from Scn1a+/- mice, a finding supported by immunohistochemical data showing elongation of the axon initial segment. Our results imply that transient impairment of action potential generation by PVINs may contribute to the initial appearance of epilepsy, but is not the mechanism of ongoing, chronic epilepsy in Dravet syndrome.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Dravet syndrome is characterized by normal early development, temperature-sensitive seizures in infancy, progression to treatment-resistant epilepsy, developmental delay, autism, and sudden unexplained death due to mutation in SCN1A encoding the Na+ channel subunit Nav1.1. Prior work has revealed a preferential impact of Nav1.1 loss on the function of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. However, such data derive exclusively from recordings of neurons in young Scn1a+/- mice. Here, we show that impaired action potential generation observed in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (PVINs) in Scn1a+/- mice during early development has normalized by postnatal day 35. This work suggests that a transient impairment of PVINs contributes to epilepsy onset, but is not the mechanism of ongoing, chronic epilepsy in Dravet syndrome.",

abstract = "Although the amygdala complex has long been known to exert a profound influence on cardiovascular activity, the neuronal and connectional substrate mediating these influences remains unclear. This paper describes a direct amygdaloid projection to medullary sensory and motor structures involved in cardiovascular regulation, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the dorsal motor nucleus (DVN), by the use of autoradiographic anterograde transport and retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) techniques in rabbits. Since all of these structures are highly heterogeneous structurally and functionally, details of the specific areas of the neuronal origin and efferent distribution of the projection were examined in relation to these features and with reference to a cytoarchitecture description of the relevant forebrain regions in the rabbit. Amygdaloid projections to the NTS and DVN, as determined from HRP experiments, arise from an extensive population of neurons concentrated exclusively within the ipsilateral central nucleus and confined to and distributed throughout a large medial subdivision of this nucleus. Projection neurons, however, also distribute without apparent interruption beyond the amygdala dorsomedially into the sublenticular substantia innominata and the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and thus delineate a single entity of possible anatomical unity across all three structures, extending rostrocaudally within the basal forebrain as a diagonal band. Descending central nucleus connections, based upon autoradiographic experiments, project heavily and extensively to both the NTS and the DVN. Within both nuclei, the projections have a highly specific distribution pattern, appearing to correspond largely to structural subdivisions, including the dorsomedial, medial, ventrolateral, ventral, and commissural NTS, and to cell group ``a,'' a caudally located dorsomedial region, and peripheral regions of the DVN, some of which appear to be involved in cardiovascular regulation. The existence of such an extensive projection system connecting these specific regions is significant evidence in support to its potential for participation in the amygdaloid expression of cardiovascular influences and has important implications for the cellular analysis of the functional role of these influences.",

author = "Kodani, Shota and Soya, Shingo and Sakurai, Takeshi",
abstract = "Emotionally salient situations usually trigger arousal along with autonomic and neuroendocrine reactions. To determine whether the extended amygdala plays a role in sleep-wakefulness regulation, we examined the effects of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic excitation of GABAergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (GABABNST neurons). Acute optogenetic excitation of these cells during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep resulted in an immediate state transition to wakefulness, whereas stimulation during REM sleep showed no effect on sleep-wakefulness states in male mice. An anterograde tracing study suggested GABABNST neurons send axonal projections to several brain regions implicated in arousal, including the preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, deep mesencephalic nucleus, and parabrachial nucleus. A dual orexin receptor antagonist, DORA-22, did not affect the optogenetic transition from NREM sleep to wakefulness. Chemogenetic excitation of GABABNST neurons evoked a sustained wakefulness state, but this arousal effect was markedly attenuated by DORA-22. These observations suggest that GABABNST neurons play an important role in transition from NREM sleep to wakefulness without the function of orexin neurons, but prolonged excitation of these cells mobilizes the orexin system to sustain wakefulness.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We examined the role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the regulation of wakefulness. Optogenetic excitation of GABAergic neurons in the BNST (GABABNST neurons) during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice resulted in immediate transition to a wakefulness state without function of orexins. Prolonged excitation of GABABNST neurons by a chemogenetic method evoked a longer-lasting, sustained wakefulness state, which was abolished by preadministration of a dual orexin receptor antagonist, DORA-22. This study revealed a role of the BNST GABAergic system in sleep-wakefulness control, especially in shifting animals' behavioral states from NREM sleep to wakefulness, and provides an important insight into the pathophysiology of insomnia and the role of orexin in arousal regulation.",

abstract = "Excitatory signaling mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) has been shown to regulate mood disorders. However, current treatments targeting NMDAR subtypes have shown limited success in treating patients, highlighting a need for alternative therapeutic targets. Here, we identify a role for GluN2D-containing NMDARs in modulating emotional behaviors and neural activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Using a GluN2D knockout mouse line (GluN2D-/-), we assessed behavioral phenotypes across tasks modeling emotional behavior. We then used a combination of ex vivo electrophysiology and in vivo fiber photometry to assess changes in BNST plasticity, cell-specific physiology and cellular activity profiles. GluN2D-/- male mice exhibit evidence of exacerbated negative emotional behavior, and a deficit in BNST synaptic potentiation. We also found that GluN2D is functionally expressed on corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) positive BNST cells implicated in driving negative emotional states, and recordings in mice of both sexes revealed increased excitatory and reduced inhibitory drive onto GluN2D-/- BNST-CRF cells ex vivo, and increased activity in vivo Using a GluN2D conditional knockout line (GluN2Dflx/flx) to selectively delete the subunit from the BNST, we find that BNST-GluN2Dflx/flx male mice exhibit increased depressive-like behaviors, as well as altered NMDAR function and increased excitatory drive onto BNST-CRF neurons. Taken together, this study supports a role for GluN2D-NMDARs in regulating emotional behavior through their influence on excitatory signaling in a region-specific manner, and suggests that these NMDARs may serve as a novel target for selectively modulating glutamate signaling in stress-responsive structures and cell populations.Significance StatementExcitatory signaling mediated through NMDARs plays an important role in shaping emotional behavior, however the receptor subtypes/brain regions through which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that loss of GluN2D-containing NMDARs produces an increase in anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in mice, deficits in BNST synaptic potentiation, and increased activity in BNST-CRF neurons known to drive negative emotional behavior. Further, we determine that deleting GluN2D in the BNST leads to increased depressive-like behaviors and increased excitatory drive onto BNST-CRF cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate a role for GluN2D-NMDARs in regulating the activity of stress-responsive structures and neuronal populations in the adult brain, suggesting them as a potential target for treating negative emotional states in mood related disorders.",

In both human patients and animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy, mossy fibers sprout to form an aberrant glutamatergic network between dentate granule cells. These new synapses operate via long-lasting kainate receptor-mediated events, which are not present in the naive condition. Here, we report that in chronic epileptic rat, aberrant kainate receptors in interplay with the persistent sodium current dramatically expand the temporal window for synaptic integration. This introduces a multiplicative gain change in the input--output operation of dentate granule cells. As a result, their sparse firing is switched to an abnormal sustained and rhythmic mode.

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been linked to respiratory dysfunction, but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Here we found that both focal and generalized convulsive seizures in epilepsy patients caused a prolonged decrease in the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR; a measure of respiratory CO2 chemoreception). We then studied Scn1aR1407X/+ (Dravet Syndrome, DS) and Scn8aN1768D/+ (D/+) mice of both sexes, two models of SUDEP, and found that convulsive seizures caused a post-ictal decrease in ventilation and severely depressed the HCVR in a subset of animals. Those mice with severe post-ictal depression of the HCVR also exhibited transient post-ictal hypothermia. A combination of blunted HCVR and abnormal thermoregulation is known to occur with dysfunction of the serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system in mice. Depleting 5-HT with para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) mimicked seizure-induced hypoventilation, partially occluded the post-ictal decrease in the HCVR, exacerbated hypothermia, and increased post-ictal mortality in DS mice. Conversely, pretreatment with the 5-HT agonist fenfluramine reduced post-ictal inhibition of the HCVR and hypothermia. These results are consistent with the previous observation that seizures cause transient impairment of serotonergic neuron function, which would be expected to inhibit the many aspects of respiratory control dependent on 5-HT, including baseline ventilation and the HCVR. These results provide a scientific rationale to investigate the inter-ictal and/or post-ictal HCVR as noninvasive biomarkers for those at high risk of seizure-induced death, and to prevent SUDEP by enhancing post-ictal 5-HT tone.Significance Statement:There is increasing evidence that seizure-induced respiratory dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). However, the cellular basis of this dysfunction has not been defined. Here we show that seizures impair CO2 chemoreception in some epilepsy patients. In two mouse models of SUDEP we found that generalized convulsive seizures impaired CO2 chemoreception, and induced hypothermia, two effects reported with serotonergic neuron dysfunction. The defects in chemoreception and thermoregulation were exacerbated by chemical depletion of serotonin and prevented with fenfluramine, suggesting that seizure-induced respiratory dysfunction may be due to impairment of serotonin neuron function. These findings suggest that impaired chemoreception due to transient inhibition of serotonergic neurons may contribute to the pathophysiology of SUDEP.",

The validity of the pilocarpine model has been challenged based largely on concerns that seizures might initiate in different brain regions in rats than in patients. The present study used 32 recording electrodes per rat to evaluate spontaneous seizures in various brain regions including the septum, dorsomedial thalamus, amygdala, olfactory cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus, substantia nigra, entorhinal cortex, and ventral subiculum. Compared with published results from patients, seizures in rats tended to be shorter, spread faster and more extensively, generate behavioral manifestations more quickly, and produce generalized convulsions more frequently. Similarities to patients included electrographic waveform patterns at seizure onset, variability in sites of earliest seizure activity within individuals, and variability in patterns of seizure spread. Like patients, the earliest seizure activity in rats was recorded most frequently within the hippocampal formation. The ventral hippocampus and ventral subiculum displayed the earliest seizure activity. Amygdala, olfactory cortex, and septum occasionally displayed early seizure latencies, but not above chance levels. Substantia nigra and dorsomedial thalamus demonstrated consistently late seizure onsets, suggesting their unlikely involvement in seizure initiation. The results of the present study reveal similarities in onset sites of spontaneous seizures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and pilocarpine-treated rats that support the model's validity.",

However, the underlying circuit and cellular mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we show that mice with Erbb4 gene deficiency in somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) neurons exhibit heightened anxiety as measured in the elevated plus maze test and the open field test, two assays commonly used to assess anxiety-related behaviors in rodents. Using a combination of electrophysiological, molecular, genetic, and pharmacological techniques, we demonstrate that the abnormal anxiety in the mutant mice is caused by enhanced excitatory synaptic inputs onto SOM+ neurons in the central amygdala (CeA), and the resulting reduction in inhibition onto downstream SOM+ neurons in the BNST. Notably, our results indicate that an increase in dynorphin signaling in SOM+ CeA neurons mediates the paradoxical reduction in inhibition onto SOM+ BNST neurons, and that the consequent enhanced activity of SOM+ BNST neurons is both necessary for and sufficient to drive the elevated anxiety. Finally, we show that the elevated anxiety and the associated synaptic dysfunctions and increased dynorphin signaling in the CeA-BNST circuit of the Erbb4 mutant mice can be recapitulated by stress in wild-type mice. Together, our results unravel previously unknown circuit and cellular processes in the central extended amygdala that can cause maladaptive anxiety.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The central extended amygdala has been implicated in anxiety-related behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear.

abstract = "Mutations in SCN1A and other ion channel genes can cause different epileptic phenotypes, but the precise mechanisms underlying the development of hyperexcitable networks are largely unknown. Here, we present a multisystem analysis of an SCN1A mouse model carrying the NaV1.1-R1648H mutation, which causes febrile seizures and epilepsy in humans. We found a ubiquitous hypoexcitability of interneurons in thalamus, cortex, and hippocampus, without detectable changes in excitatory neurons. Interestingly, somatic Na(+) channels in interneurons and persistent Na(+) currents were not significantly changed. Instead, the key mechanism of interneuron dysfunction was a deficit of action potential initiation at the axon initial segment that was identified by analyzing action potential firing. This deficit increased with the duration of firing periods, suggesting that increased slow inactivation, as recorded for recombinant mutated channels, could play an important role. The deficit in interneuron firing caused reduced action potential-driven inhibition of excitatory neurons as revealed by less frequent spontaneous but not miniature IPSCs. Multiple approaches indicated increased spontaneous thalamocortical and hippocampal network activity in mutant mice, as follows: (1) more synchronous and higher-frequency firing was recorded in primary neuronal cultures plated on multielectrode arrays; (2) thalamocortical slices examined by field potential recordings revealed spontaneous activities and pathological high-frequency oscillations; and (3) multineuron Ca(2+) imaging in hippocampal slices showed increased spontaneous neuronal activity. Thus, an interneuron-specific generalized defect in action potential initiation causes multisystem disinhibition and network hyperexcitability, which can well explain the occurrence of seizures in the studied mouse model and in patients carrying this mutation.",

abstract = "$\alpha$2-adrenergic receptors (AR) within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) reduce stress-reward interactions in rodent models. In addition to their roles as autoreceptors, BNST $\alpha$(2A)-ARs suppress glutamatergic transmission. One prominent glutamatergic input to the BNST originates from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and consists of asymmetric axosomatic synapses containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vGluT2. Here we provide immunoelectron microscopic data showing that many asymmetric axosomatic synapses in the BNST contain $\alpha$(2A)-ARs. Further, we examined optically evoked glutamate release ex vivo in BNST from mice with virally delivered channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) expression in PBN. In BNST from these animals, ChR2 partially colocalized with CGRP, and activation generated EPSCs in dorsal anterolateral BNST neurons that elicited two cell-type-specific outcomes: (1) feedforward inhibition or (2) an EPSP that elicited firing. We found that the $\alpha$(2A)-AR agonist guanfacine selectively inhibited this PBN input to the BNST, preferentially reducing the excitatory response in ex vivo mouse brain slices. To begin to assess the overall impact of $\alpha$(2A)-AR control of this PBN input on BNST excitatory transmission, we used a Thy1-COP4 mouse line with little postsynaptic ChR2 expression nor colocalization of ChR2 with CGRP in the BNST. In slices from these mice, we found that guanfacine enhanced, rather than suppressed, optogenetically initiated excitatory drive in BNST. Thus, our study reveals distinct actions of PBN afferents within the BNST and suggests that $\alpha$(2A)-AR agonists may filter excitatory transmission in the BNST by inhibiting a component of the PBN input while enhancing the actions of other inputs.",

In 2009, Walker, Miles, and Davis proposed a model of amygdala-BNST interactions to explain these functional differences. This model became extremely influential and now guides a new wave of studies on the role of BNST in humans. Here, we consider evidence for and against this model, in the process highlighting central principles of BNST organization. This analysis leads us to conclude that BNST's influence is not limited to the generation of anxiety-like responses to diffuse threats, but that it also shapes the impact of discrete threatening stimuli. It is likely that BNST-CeA interactions are involved in modulating responses to such threats. In addition, whereas current views emphasize the contributions of the anterolateral BNST region in anxiety, accumulating data indicate that the anteromedial and anteroventral regions also play a critical role. The presence of multiple functional subregions within the small volume of BNST raises significant technical obstacles for functional imaging studies in humans.",

abstract = "UNLABELLED: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is increasingly recognized as a common and devastating problem. Because impaired breathing is thought to play a critical role in these deaths, we sought to identify forebrain sites underlying seizure-evoked hypoventilation in humans. We took advantage of an extraordinary clinical opportunity to study a research participant with medically intractable epilepsy who had extensive bilateral frontotemporal electrode coverage while breathing was monitored during seizures recorded by intracranial electrodes and mapped by high-resolution brain imaging. We found that central apnea and O2 desaturation occurred when seizures spread to the amygdala. In the same patient, localized electrical stimulation of the amygdala reproduced the apnea and O2 desaturation. Similar effects of amygdala stimulation were observed in two additional subjects, including one without a seizure disorder. The participants were completely unaware of the apnea evoked by stimulation and expressed no dyspnea, despite being awake and vigilant. In contrast, voluntary breath holding of similar duration caused severe dyspnea. These findings suggest a functional connection between the amygdala and medullary respiratory network in humans. Moreover, they suggest that seizure spread to the amygdala may cause loss of spontaneous breathing of which patients are unaware, and thus has potential to contribute to SUDEP. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common cause of death in patients with chronic refractory epilepsy. Impaired breathing during and after seizures is common and suspected to play a role in SUDEP. Understanding the cause of this peri-ictal hypoventilation may lead to preventative strategies. In epilepsy patients, we found that seizure invasion of the amygdala co-occurred with apnea and oxygen desaturation, and electrical stimulation of the amygdala reproduced these respiratory findings. Strikingly, the subjects were unaware of the apnea. These findings indicate a functional connection between the amygdala and brainstem respiratory network in humans and suggest that amygdala seizures may cause loss of spontaneous breathing of which patients are unaware-a combination that could be deadly.",

abstract = "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe early-onset epilepsy associated with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A Animal models of DS with global Scn1a haploinsufficiency recapitulate the DS phenotype including seizures, premature death, and impaired spatial memory performance. Spatial memory requires hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-R), which consist of high-frequency field potential oscillations (ripples, 100-260 Hz) superimposed on a slower sharp wave (SPW). Published in vitro electrophysiologic recordings in DS mice demonstrate reduced firing of GABAergic inhibitory neurons, which are essential for the formation of SPW-R complexes. Here, in vivo electrophysiologic recordings of hippocampal local field potential (LFP) in both male and female mice demonstrate that Scn1a haploinsufficiency slows intrinsic ripple frequency and reduces the rate of SPW-R occurrence. In DS mice, peak ripple band power is shifted to lower frequencies, average inter-trough intervals of individually detected ripples are slower and the rate of SPW-R generation is reduced, while SPW amplitude remains unaffected. These alterations in SPW-R properties, in combination with published reductions in interneuron function in DS, suggest a direct link between reduced inhibitory neuron excitability and impaired SPW-R function. A simple interconnected, conductance-based in silico interneuron network model was utilized to determine if reduced sodium conductance is sufficient to slow ripple frequency, and stimulation with a modeled SPW demonstrates that reduced sodium conductance alone is sufficient to slow oscillatory frequencies. These findings forge a potential mechanistic link between impaired SPW-R generation and Scn1a mutation in DS mice, expanding the set of disorders in which SPW-R dysfunction contributes to impaired memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDisruption of sharp wave ripples, a characteristic hippocampal rhythm coordinated by the precise timing of GABAergic interneurons, impairs spatial learning and memory. Prior in vitro patch clamp recordings in brain slices from genetic mouse models of Dravet syndrome (DS) reveal reduced sodium current and excitability in GABAergic interneurons but not excitatory cells, suggesting a causal role for impaired interneuron activity in seizures and cognitive impairment. Here, heterozygous Scn1a mutation in DS mice reduces hippocampal sharp wave ripple occurrence and slows internal ripple frequency in vivo and a simple in silico model demonstrates reduction in interneuron function alone is sufficient to slow model oscillations.

abstract = "Stress is a precipitating agent in neuropsychiatric disease and initiates relapse to drug-seeking behavior in addicted patients. Targeting the stress system in protracted abstinence from drugs of abuse with anxiolytics may be an effective treatment modality for substance use disorders. $\alpha$2A-adrenergic receptors ($\alpha$2A-ARs) in extended amygdala structures play key roles in dampening stress responses. Contrary to early thinking, $\alpha$2A-ARs are expressed at non-noradrenergic sites in the brain. These non-noradrenergic $\alpha$2A-ARs play important roles in stress responses, but their cellular mechanisms of action are unclear. In humans, the $\alpha$2A-AR agonist guanfacine reduces overall craving and uncouples craving from stress, yet minimally affects relapse, potentially due to competing actions in the brain. Here, we show that heteroceptor $\alpha$2A-ARs postsynaptically enhance dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST) neuronal activity in mice of both sexes. This effect is mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels because inhibition of these channels is necessary and sufficient for excitatory actions. Finally, this excitatory action is mimicked by clozapine-N-oxide activation of the Gi-coupled DREADD hM4Di in dBNST neurons and its activation elicits anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Together, these data provide a framework for elucidating cell-specific actions of GPCR signaling and provide a potential mechanism whereby competing anxiogenic and anxiolytic actions of guanfacine may affect its clinical utility in the treatment of addiction.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Stress affects the development of neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and addiction. Guanfacine is an $\alpha$2A-adrenergic receptor ($\alpha$2A-AR) agonist with actions in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that produces antidepressant actions and uncouples stress from reward-related behaviors. Here, we show that guanfacine increases dorsal BNST neuronal activity through actions at postsynaptic $\alpha$2A-ARs via a mechanism that involves hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated cation channels. This action is mimicked by activation of the designer receptor hM4Di expressed in the BNST, which also induces anxiety-like behaviors. Together, these data suggest that postsynaptic $\alpha$2A-ARs in BNST have excitatory actions on BNST neurons and that these actions can be phenocopied by the so-called ``inhibitory'' DREADDs, suggesting that care must be taken regarding interpretation of data obtained with these tools.",

abstract = "Epilepsy after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with poor quality of life. This study aimed to characterize post-traumatic epilepsy in a mouse model of pediatric brain injury, and to evaluate the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling as a target for pharmacological intervention. Male mice received a controlled cortical impact or sham surgery at postnatal day 21, approximating a toddler-aged child. Mice were treated acutely with an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; 100 mg/kg s.c.) or vehicle. Spontaneous and evoked seizures were evaluated from video-EEG recordings. Behavioral assays tested for functional outcomes, post-mortem analyses assessed neuropathology, and brain atrophy was detected by ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging. At 2 weeks and 3 months post-injury, TBI mice showed an elevated seizure response to the convulsant pentylenetetrazol compared to sham mice, associated with abnormal hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting. A robust increase in IL-1$\beta$ and IL-1 receptor were detected after TBI. IL-1Ra treatment reduced seizure susceptibility 2 weeks after TBI compared to vehicle, and a reduction in hippocampal astrogliosis. In a chronic study, IL-1Ra-TBI mice showed improved spatial memory at 4 months post-injury. At 5 months, most TBI mice exhibited spontaneous seizures during a 7 day video-EEG recording period. At 6 months, IL-1Ra-TBI mice had fewer evoked seizures compared to vehicle controls, coinciding with greater preservation of cortical tissue. Findings demonstrate this model's utility to delineate mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis after pediatric brain injury, and provide evidence of IL-1 signaling as a mediator of post-traumatic astrogliosis and seizure susceptibility.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEpilepsy is a common cause of morbidity after traumatic brain injury in early childhood. However, a limited understanding of how epilepsy develops, particularly in the immature brain, likely contributes to the lack of efficacious treatments. In this preclinical study, we first demonstrate that a mouse model of traumatic injury to the pediatric brain reproduces many neuropathological and seizure-like hallmarks characteristic of epilepsy. Secondly, we demonstrate that targeting the acute inflammatory response reduces cognitive impairments, the degree of neuropathology, and seizure susceptibility, after pediatric brain injury in mice. These findings provide evidence that inflammatory cytokine signaling is a key process underlying epilepsy development after an acquired brain insult, which represents a feasible therapeutic target to improve quality of life for survivors.",

abstract = "Stress contributes to numerous psychiatric disorders. CRF signaling and CRF neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) drive negative affective behaviors, thus agents that decrease activity of these cells may be of therapeutic interest. Here, we show that acute restraint stress increases cFos expression in CRF neurons in the mouse dorsal BNST, consistent with a role for these neurons in stress-related behaviors. We find that activation of $\alpha$2A-adrenergic receptors (ARs) by the agonist guanfacine reduced cFos expression in these neurons both in stressed and unstressed conditions. Further, we find that $\alpha$- and $\beta$-ARs differentially regulate excitatory drive onto these neurons. Pharmacological and channelrhodopsin-assisted mapping experiments suggest that $\alpha$2A-ARs specifically reduce excitatory drive from parabrachial nucleus (PBN) afferents onto CRF neurons. Given that the $\alpha$2A-AR is a Gi-linked GPCR, we assessed the impact of activating the Gi-coupled DREADD hM4Di in the PBN on restraint stress regulation of BNST CRF neurons. CNO activation of PBN hM4Di reduced stress-induced Fos in BNST Crh neurons. Further, utilizing Prkcd as an additional marker of BNST neuronal identity, we uncovered a female-specific upregulation of the co-expression of Prkcd/Crh in BNST neurons following stress, which was prevented by ovariectomy. These findings show that stress activates BNST CRF neurons, and that $\alpha$2A-AR activation suppresses the in vivo activity of these cells, at least in part by suppressing excitatory drive from PBN inputs onto CRF neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTStress is a major variable contributing to mood disorders. Here, we show that stress increases activation of BNST CRF neurons that drive negative affective behavior. We find that the clinically well-tolerated $\alpha$2A-AR agonist guanfacine reduces activity of these cells in vivo, and reduces excitatory PBN inputs onto these cells ex vivo Additionally, we uncover a novel sex-dependent co-expression of Prkcd with Crh in female BNST neurons after stress, an effect abolished by ovariectomy. These results demonstrate input-specific interactions between NE and CRF, and point to an action by which guanfacine may reduce negative affective responses.",

abstract = "Postinjury epilepsy is an potentially preventable sequela in as many as 20\% of patients with brain insults. For these cases biomarkers of epileptogenesis are critical to facilitate identification of patients at high-risk of developing epilepsy and to introduce effective anti-epileptogenic interventions. Here, we demonstrate that delayed brain-heart coincidences serve as a reliable biomarker. In a murine model of post-infection acquired epilepsy, we used long-term simultaneous measurements of the brain activity via electroencephalography and autonomic cardiac activity via electrocardiography, in male mice, to quantitatively track brain-heart interactions during epileptogenesis. We find that abnormal cortical discharges precede abnormal fluctuations in the cardiac rhythm at the resolution of single beat-to-beat intervals. The delayed brain-heart coincidence is detectable as early as the onset of chronic measurements, 2-14 weeks before the first seizure, only in animals that become epileptic, and increases during epileptogenesis. Therefore, delayed brain-heart coincidence serves as a biomarker of epileptogenesis and could be used for phenotyping, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT No biomarker that readily predicts and tracks epileptogenesis currently exists for the wide range of human acquired epilepsies. Here, we used long-term measurements of brain and heart activity in a mouse model of post-infection acquired epilepsy to investigate the potential of brain-heart interaction as a biomarker of epileptogenesis. We found that delayed coincidences from brain to heart can clearly separate the mice that became epileptic from those that did not weeks before development of epilepsy. Our findings allow for phenotyping and tracking of epileptogenesis in this and likely other models of acquired epilepsy. Such capability is critical for efficient adjunctive treatment development and for tracking the efficacy of such treatments.",

Previous work in disorders of consciousness including the postictal state suggests that bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic intralaminar central lateral nucleus (CL) may improve level of arousal. We tested the effects of postictal thalamic CL DBS in a rat model of secondarily generalized seizures elicited by electrical hippocampal stimulation. Thalamic CL DBS was delivered at 100 Hz during the postictal period in 21 female rats while measuring cortical electrophysiology and behavior. The postictal period was characterized by frontal cortical slow waves, like other states of depressed consciousness. In addition, rats exhibited severely impaired responses on two different behavioral tasks in the postictal state. Thalamic CL stimulation prevented postictal cortical slow wave activity but produced only modest behavioral improvement on a spontaneous licking sucrose reward task. We therefore also tested responses using a lever-press shock escape/avoidance (E/A) task. Rats achieved high success rates responding to the sound warning on the E/A task even during natural slow wave sleep but were severely impaired in the postictal state. Unlike the spontaneous licking task, thalamic CL DBS during the E/A task produced a marked improvement in behavior, with significant increases in lever-press shock avoidance with DBS compared with sham controls. These findings support the idea that DBS of subcortical arousal structures may be a novel therapeutic strategy benefitting patients with medically and surgically refractory epilepsy.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The postictal state following seizures is characterized by impaired consciousness and has a major negative impact on individuals with epilepsy. For the first time, we developed two behavioral tasks and demonstrate that bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic intralaminar central lateral nucleus (CL) decreased cortical slow wave activity and improved task performance in the postictal period. Because preclinical task performance studies are crucial to explore the effectiveness and safety of DBS treatment, our work is clinically relevant as it could support and help set the foundations for a human neurostimulation trial to improve postictal responsiveness in patients with medically and surgically refractory epilepsy.",

There is currently no evidence for the activation of kainate receptors (KARs) at recurrent mossy fiber synapses in epileptic animals, despite their important role at control mossy fiber synapses. We report that KARs are involved in ongoing glutamatergic transmission in granule cells from chronic epileptic but not control animals. KARs provide a substantial component of glutamatergic activity, because they support half of the non-NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory drive in these cells. KAR-mediated EPSCKAs are selectively generated by recurrent mossy fiber inputs and have a slower kinetics than EPSCAMPA. Therefore, in addition to axonal rewiring, sprouting of mossy fibers induces a shift in the nature of glutamatergic transmission in granule cells that may contribute to the physiopathology of the dentate gyrus in epileptic animals.",

author = "Shetty, Ashok K and Zaman, Vandana and Hattiangady, Bharathi",
abstract = "Intracerebroventricular kainate administration in rat, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), causes degeneration of the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal and dentate hilar neurons. This leads to a robust but aberrant sprouting of the granule cell axons (mossy fibers) into the dentate supragranular layer and the CA3 stratum oriens. Because this plasticity is linked to an increased seizure susceptibility in TLE, strategies that restrain the aberrant mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) are perceived to be important for preventing the TLE development after the hippocampal injury. We ascertained the efficacy of fetal hippocampal CA3 or CA1 cell grafting into the kainate-lesioned CA3 region of the adult rat hippocampus at early post-kainic acid injury for providing a lasting inhibition of the aberrant MFS. Analyses at 12 months after grafting revealed that host mossy fibers project vigorously into CA3 cell grafts but avoid CA1 cell grafts. Consequently, in animals receiving CA3 cell grafts, the extent of aberrant MFS was minimal, in comparison with the robust MFS observed in both ``lesion-only'' animals and animals receiving CA1 cell grafts. Analyses of the graft axon growth revealed strong graft efferent projections into the dentate supragranular layer with CA3 cell grafting but not with CA1 cell grafting. Thus, the formation of reciprocal circuitry between the dentate granule cells and the grafted CA3 pyramidal neurons is likely the basis of inhibition of the aberrant MFS by CA3 cell grafts. The results also underscore that grafting of cells capable of differentiating into CA3 pyramidal neurons is highly efficacious for a lasting inhibition of the abnormal mossy fiber circuitry development in the injured hippocampus.",

abstract = "Carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation lowers brain pH and induces anxiety, fear, and panic responses in humans. In mice, CO2 produces freezing and avoidance behavior that has been suggested to depend on the amygdala. However, a recent study in humans with bilateral amygdala lesions revealed that CO2 can trigger fear and panic even in the absence of amygdalae, suggesting the importance of extra-amygdalar brain structures. Because the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) contributes to fear- and anxiety-related behaviors and expresses acid-sensing ion channel-1A (ASIC1A), we hypothesized that the BNST plays an important role in CO2-evoked fear-related behaviors in mice. We found that BNST lesions decreased both CO2-evoked freezing and CO2-conditioned place avoidance. In addition, we found that CO2 inhalation caused BNST acidosis and that acidosis was sufficient to depolarize BNST neurons and induce freezing behavior; both responses depended on ASIC1A. Finally, disrupting Asic1a specifically in the BNST reduced CO2-evoked freezing, whereas virus-vector-mediated expression of ASIC1A in the BNST of Asic1a(-/-) and Asic1a(+/+) mice increased CO2-evoked freezing. Together, these findings identify the BNST as an extra-amygdalar fear circuit structure important in CO2-evoked fear-related behavior.",

abstract = "Seizure-related apnea is common and can be lethal. Its mechanisms however remain unclear and preventive strategies are lacking. We postulate that brainstem spreading depolarization (SD), previously associated with lethal seizures in animal models, initiates apnea upon invasion of brainstem respiratory centers. To study this, we assessed effects of brainstem seizures on brainstem function and respiration in male and female mice carrying a homozygous S218L missense mutation that leads to gain-of-function of voltage-gated CaV2.1 Ca2+ channels and high risk for fatal seizures. Recordings of brainstem DC potential and neuronal activity, cardiorespiratory activity and local tissue oxygen were performed in freely behaving animals. Brainstem SD occurred during all spontaneous fatal seizures and, unexpectedly, during a subset of non-fatal seizures. Seizure-related SDs in the ventrolateral medulla correlated with respiratory suppression. Seizures induced by stimulation of the inferior colliculus could evoke SD that spread in a rostro-caudal direction, preceding local tissue hypoxia and apnea, indicating that invasion of SD into medullary respiratory centers initiated apnea and hypoxia rather than vice versa Fatal outcome was prevented by timely resuscitation. Moreover, NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and memantine prevented seizure-related SD and apnea, which supports brainstem SD as a prerequisite for brainstem seizure-related apnea in this animal model and has translational value for developing strategies that prevent fatal ictal apnea.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTApnea during and following seizures is common, but also likely implicated in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This underlines the need to understand mechanisms for potentially lethal seizure-related apnea. In the present work we show, in freely behaving SUDEP-prone transgenic mice, that apnea is induced when spontaneous brainstem seizure-related spreading depolarization (SD) reaches respiratory nuclei in the ventrolateral medulla. We show that brainstem seizure-related medullary SD is followed by local hypoxia and recovers during non-fatal seizures, but not during fatal events. NMDA receptor antagonists prevented medullary SD and apnea, which may be of translational value.",

Herein, we employed a combination of immunoblotting, neuropharmacological and transgenic procedures to investigate the role for metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) signaling within the BNST in excessive drinking. We discovered that mGlu5 signaling in the BNST is linked to excessive alcohol consumption in a manner distinct from behavioral or neuropharmacological endophenotypes that have been previously implicated as triggers for heavy drinking. Our studies demonstrate that, in male mice, a history of chronic binge alcohol-drinking elevates BNST levels of the mGlu5-scaffolding protein Homer2 and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in an adaptive response to limit alcohol consumption. Male and female transgenic mice expressing a point mutation of mGlu5 that cannot be phosphorylated by ERK exhibit excessive alcohol-drinking, despite greater behavioral signs of alcohol intoxication and reduced anxiety, and are insensitive to local manipulations of signaling in the BNST. These transgenic mice also show selective insensitivity to alcohol-aversion and increased novelty-seeking, which may be relevant to excessive drinking. Further, the insensitivity to alcohol-aversion exhibited by male mice can be mimicked by the local inhibition of ERK signaling within the BNST. Our findings elucidate a novel mGluR5-linked signaling state within BNST that plays a central and unanticipated role in excessive alcohol consumption.Significance StatementThe bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is part of the limbic-hypothalamic system important for behavioral responses to stress and alcohol, and glutamate transmission within BNST is implicated in the neurobiology of alcoholism. The present study provides evidence that a history of excessive alcohol drinking increases signaling through the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) receptor within the BNST in an adaptive response to limit alcohol consumption. In particular, disruption of mGlu5 phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) within this brain region induces excessive alcohol-drinking,that reflects a selective insensitivity to the aversive properties of alcohol intoxication. These data indicate that a specific signaling state of mGlu5 within BNST plays a central and unanticipated role in excessive alcohol consumption.",

Despite significant evidence from clinical studies reporting hyperactivity of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) under these conditions, the role of BNST in fear learning and expression is still not clarified. Here, we tested how BNST modulates fear learning in male mice using a chemogenetic approach. Activation of GABAergic neurons of BNST during fear conditioning or memory consolidation resulted in enhanced cue-related fear recall. Importantly, BNST activation had no acute impact on fear expression during conditioning or recalls, but it enhanced cue-related fear recall subsequently, potentially via altered activity of downstream regions. Enhanced fear memory consolidation could be replicated by selectively activating somatostatin (SOM), but not corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), neurons of the BNST, which was accompanied by increased fear generalization. Our findings suggest the significant modulation of fear memory strength by specific circuits of the BNST.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) mediates different defensive behaviors, and its connections implicate its integrative modulatory role in fear memory formation; however, the involvement of BNST in fear learning has yet to be elucidated in detail. Our data highlight that BNST stimulation enhances fear memory formation without direct effects on fear expression. Our study identified somatostatin (SOM) cells within the extended amygdala as specific neurons promoting fear memory formation.

abstract = "The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) is implicated in the control of breathing, but the neuronal phenotype and circuit mechanism involved in such a physiological function remain incompletely understood. This study focused on the respiratory role of paired-like homeobox 2b gene (Phox2b)-expressing NTS neurons and sought to determine whether selective stimulation of this set of neurons activates breathing in male mice. A Cre-dependent vector encoding a Gq-coupled human M3 muscarinic receptor (hM3Dq) was microinjected into the NTS of Phox2b-Cre transgenic mice. The hM3Dq-transduced neurons were pharmacologically activated in conscious mice while respiratory effects were measured by plethysmography. We demonstrate that chemogenetic stimulation of Phox2b-expressing NTS neurons significantly increased baseline minute volume via an increase in respiratory frequency rather than tidal volume. Chemogenetic stimulation also synergized with moderate CO2 stimulation to enhance pulmonary ventilatory response. Selective ablation of Phox2b-expressing NTS neurons notably attenuated a hypercapnic ventilatory response. Moreover, histological evidence revealed that stimulation of Phox2b-expressing NTS neurons increased neuronal activity of the preB{\"o}tzinger complex. Finally, we presented the neuroanatomical evidence of direct projection of Phox2b-expressing NTS neurons to putative respiratory central pattern generator. Overall, these findings suggest that selective activation of Phox2b-expressing NTS neurons potentiates baseline pulmonary ventilation via an excitatory drive to respiratory central pattern generator and this group of neurons is also required for the hypercapnic ventilatory response.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) has been implicated in the control of breathing.

Genetic ablation of these neurons attenuates the hypercapnic ventilatory response. We also suggest that a fraction of Phox2b-expressing neurons exhibit CO2 sensitivity and presumably function as central respiratory chemoreceptors.

abstract = "Hippocampal specimens resected to cure medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) provide a unique possibility to study functional consequences of morphological alterations. One intriguing alteration predominantly observed in cases of hippocampal sclerosis is an uncommon network of granule cells monosynaptically interconnected via aberrant supragranular mossy fibers. We investigated whether granule cell populations in slices from sclerotic and nonsclerotic hippocampi would develop ictaform activity when challenged by low-frequency hilar stimulation in the presence of elevated extracellular potassium concentration (10 and 12 mm) and whether the experimental activity differs according to the presence of aberrant mossy fibers. We found that ictaform activity could be evoked in slices from sclerotic and nonsclerotic hippocampi (27 of 40 slices, 14 of 20 patients; and 11 of 22 slices, 6 of 12 patients, respectively). However, the two patient groups differed with respect to the pattern of ictaform discharges and the potassium concentration mandatory for its induction. Seizure-like events were already induced with 10 mm K+. They exclusively occurred in slices from sclerotic hippocampi, of which 80\% displayed stimulus-induced oscillatory population responses (250-300 Hz). In slices from nonsclerotic hippocampi, atypical negative field potential shifts were predominantly evoked with 12 mm K+. In both groups, the ictaform activity was sensitive to ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and lowering of [Ca2+]o. Our results show that, in granule cell populations of hippocampal slices from TLE patients, high K+-induced seizure-like activity and ictal spiking coincide with basic electrophysiological abnormalities, hippocampal sclerosis, and mossy fiber sprouting, suggesting that network reorganization could play a crucial role in determining type and threshold of such activity.",

abstract = "Hypoxic encephalopathy is the most common cause of neonatal seizures and can lead to chronic epilepsy. In rats at postnatal days 10--12 (P10--12), global hypoxia induces spontaneous seizures and chronically decreases seizure threshold, thus mimicking clinical aspects of neonatal hypoxia. We have shown previously that the acute and chronic epileptogenic effects of hypoxia are age-dependent and require AMPA receptor activation. In this study, we aimed to determine whether hypoxia-induced seizures and epileptogenesis are associated with maturational and seizure-induced changes in AMPA receptor composition and function. Northern and Western blots indicated that glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) mRNA and protein expression were significantly lower in neocortex and hippocampus at P10--12 compared with adult. After hypoxia-induced seizures at P10, GluR2 mRNA was significantly decreased within 48 hr, and GluR2 protein was significantly decreased within 96 hr. AMPA-induced Co2+ uptake by neurons in hippocampal slices indicated higher expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors in immature pyramidal neurons compared with adult. In slices obtained 96 hr after hypoxia-induced seizures, AMPA-induced Co2+ uptake was significantly increased compared with age-matched controls, and field recordings revealed increased tetanus-induced afterdischarges that could be kindled in the absence of NMDA receptor activation. In situ end labeling showed no acute or delayed cell death after hypoxia-induced seizures. Our results indicate that susceptibility to hypoxia-induced seizures occurs during a developmental stage in which the expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors is relatively high. Furthermore, perinatal hypoxia-induced seizures induce increased expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors and an increased capacity for AMPA receptor-mediated epileptogenesis without inducing cell death.",

abstract = "Loss-of-function mutations of Na(V)1.1 channels cause severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI), which is accompanied by severe ataxia that contributes substantially to functional impairment and premature deaths. Mutant mice lacking Na(V)1.1 channels provide a genetic model for SMEI, exhibiting severe seizures and premature death on postnatal day 15. Behavioral assessment indicated severe motor deficits in mutant mice, including irregularity of stride length during locomotion, impaired motor reflexes in grasping, and mild tremor in limbs when immobile, consistent with cerebellar dysfunction. Immunohistochemical studies showed that Na(V)1.1 and Na(V)1.6 channels are the primary sodium channel isoforms expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. The amplitudes of whole-cell peak, persistent, and resurgent sodium currents in Purkinje neurons were reduced by 58-69\%, without detectable changes in the kinetics or voltage dependence of channel activation or inactivation. Nonlinear loss of sodium current in Purkinje neurons from heterozygous and homozygous mutant animals suggested partial compensatory upregulation of Na(V)1.6 channel activity. Current-clamp recordings revealed that the firing rates of Purkinje neurons from mutant mice were substantially reduced, with no effect on threshold for action potential generation. Our results show that Na(V)1.1 channels play a crucial role in the excitability of cerebellar Purkinje neurons, with major contributions to peak, persistent, and resurgent forms of sodium current and to sustained action potential firing. Loss of these channels in Purkinje neurons of mutant mice and SMEI patients may be sufficient to cause their ataxia and related functional deficits.",

abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a forebrain region highly responsive to stress that expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and is implicated in mood disorders, such as anxiety. However, the exact mechanism by which chronic stress induces CRH-mediated dysfunction in BNST and maladaptive behaviors remains unclear. Here, we first confirmed that selective acute optogenetic activation of the oval nucleus BNST (ovBNST) increases maladaptive avoidance behaviors in male mice. Next, we found that a 6 week chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) paradigm resulted in maladaptive behaviors and increased cellular excitability of ovBNST CRH neurons by potentiating mEPSC amplitude, altering the resting membrane potential, and diminishing M-currents (a voltage-gated K+ current that stabilizes membrane potential) in ex vivo slices. CVMS also increased c-fos+ cells in ovBNST following handling. We next investigated potential molecular mechanism underlying the electrophysiological effects and observed that CVMS increased CRH+ and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide+ (PACAP; a CRH upstream regulator) cells but decreased striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase+ (a STEP CRH inhibitor) cells in ovBNST. Interestingly, the electrophysiological effects of CVMS were reversed by CRHR1-selective antagonist R121919 application. CVMS also activated protein kinase A (PKA) in BNST, and chronic infusion of the PKA-selective antagonist H89 into ovBNST reversed the effects of CVMS. Coadministration of the PKA agonist forskolin prevented the beneficial effects of R121919. Finally, CVMS induced an increase in surface expression of phosphorylated GluR1 (S845) in BNST. Collectively, these findings highlight a novel and indispensable stress-induced role for PKA-dependent CRHR1 signaling in activating BNST CRH neurons and mediating maladaptive behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Chronic stress and acute activation of oval bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST) induces maladaptive behaviors in rodents. However, the precise molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chronic variable mild stress activates corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-associated stress signaling and CRH neurons in ovBNST by potentiating mEPSC amplitude and decreasing M-current in male mice. These electrophysiological alterations and maladaptive behaviors were mediated by BNST protein kinase A-dependent CRHR1 signaling.

abstract = "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which mediates the body's response to stress, is largely under GABAergic control. Here we demonstrate that corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons are modulated by the stress-derived neurosteroid, THDOC, acting on $\delta$ subunit-containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs). Under normal conditions, THDOC potentiates the inhibitory effects of GABA on CRH neurons, decreasing the activity of the HPA axis. Counter-intuitively, following stress, THDOC activates the HPA axis due to dephosphorylation of KCC2 residue Ser940, resulting in a collapse of the chloride gradient and excitatory GABAergic transmission. The effects of THDOC on CRH neurons are mediated by actions on GABAAR $\delta$ subunit-containing receptors since these effects are abolished in Gabrd−/− mice under both control and stress conditions. Interestingly, blocking neurosteroidogenesis with finasteride is sufficient to block the stress-induced elevations in corticosterone and prevent stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice. These data demonstrate that positive feedback of neurosteroids onto CRH neurons is required to mount the physiological response to stress. Further, GABAAR $\delta$ subunit-containing receptors and phosphorylation of KCC2 residue Ser940 may be novel targets for control of the stress response, which has therapeutic potential for numerous disorders associated with hyperexcitability of the HPA axis, including Cushing's syndrome, epilepsy, and major depression.",

author = "Zelano, Christina and Jiang, Heidi and Zhou, Guangyu and Arora, Nikita and Schuele, Stephan and Rosenow, Joshua and Gottfried, Jay A",
abstract = "The need to breathe links the mammalian olfactory system inextricably to the respiratory rhythms that draw air through the nose. In rodents and other small animals, slow oscillations of local field potential activity are driven at the rate of breathing (∼2-12 Hz) in olfactory bulb and cortex, and faster oscillatory bursts are coupled to specific phases of the respiratory cycle. These dynamic rhythms are thought to regulate cortical excitability and coordinate network interactions, helping to shape olfactory coding, memory, and behavior. However, while respiratory oscillations are a ubiquitous hallmark of olfactory system function in animals, direct evidence for such patterns is lacking in humans. In this study, we acquired intracranial EEG data from rare patients (Ps) with medically refractory epilepsy, enabling us to test the hypothesis that cortical oscillatory activity would be entrained to the human respiratory cycle, albeit at the much slower rhythm of ∼0.16-0.33 Hz. Our results reveal that natural breathing synchronizes electrical activity in human piriform (olfactory) cortex, as well as in limbic-related brain areas, including amygdala and hippocampus. Notably, oscillatory power peaked during inspiration and dissipated when breathing was diverted from nose to mouth. Parallel behavioral experiments showed that breathing phase enhances fear discrimination and memory retrieval. Our findings provide a unique framework for understanding the pivotal role of nasal breathing in coordinating neuronal oscillations to support stimulus processing and behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Animal studies have long shown that olfactory oscillatory activity emerges in line with the natural rhythm of breathing, even in the absence of an odor stimulus. Whether the breathing cycle induces cortical oscillations in the human brain is poorly understood. In this study, we collected intracranial EEG data from rare patients with medically intractable epilepsy, and found evidence for respiratory entrainment of local field potential activity in human piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. These effects diminished when breathing was diverted to the mouth, highlighting the importance of nasal airflow for generating respiratory oscillations. Finally, behavioral data in healthy subjects suggest that breathing phase systematically influences cognitive tasks related to amygdala and hippocampal functions.",

author = "Cai, You-Qing and Wang, Wei and Paulucci-Holthauzen, Adriana and Pan, Zhizhong Z",
abstract = "The amygdala is important for processing emotion, including negative emotion such as anxiety and depression induced by chronic pain. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in recent years on amygdala regulation of both negative (fear) and positive (reward) behavioral responses, our current understanding is still limited regarding how the amygdala processes and integrates these negative and positive emotion responses within the amygdala circuits. In this study with optogenetic stimulation of specific brain circuits, we investigated how amygdala circuits regulate negative and positive emotion behaviors, using pain as an emotional assay in male rats. We report here that activation of the excitatory pathway from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) that relays peripheral pain signals to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) is sufficient to cause behaviors of negative emotion including anxiety, depression, and aversion in normal rats. In strong contrast, activation of the excitatory pathway from basolateral amygdala (BLA) that conveys processed corticolimbic signals to CeA dramatically opposes these behaviors of negative emotion, reducing anxiety and depression, and induces behavior of reward. Surprisingly, activating the PBN-CeA pathway to simulate pain signals does not change pain sensitivity itself, but activating the BLA-CeA pathway inhibits basal and sensitized pain. These findings demonstrate that the pain signal conveyed through the PBN-CeA pathway is sufficient to drive negative emotion and that the corticolimbic signal via the BLA-CeA pathway counteracts the negative emotion, suggesting a top-down brain mechanism for cognitive control of negative emotion under stressful environmental conditions such as pain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT It remains unclear how the amygdala circuits integrate both negative and positive emotional responses and the brain circuits that link peripheral pain to negative emotion are largely unknown. Using optogenetic stimulation, this study shows that the excitatory projection from the parabrachial nucleus to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) is sufficient to drive behaviors of negative emotion including anxiety, depression, and aversion in rats. Conversely, activation of the excitatory projection from basolateral amygdala to CeA counteracts each of these behaviors of negative emotion. Thus, this study identifies a brain pathway that mediates pain-driven negative emotion and a brain pathway that counteracts these emotion behaviors in a top-down mechanism for brain control of negative emotion.",

To characterize the mechanisms underlying FR oscillations (200-600 Hz), we studied activity of single neurons and neuronal networks in rat hippocampal slices in vitro. The correlation between the action potentials of bursting pyramidal cells and local field potential oscillations suggests that synchronous onset of action potential bursts and similar intrinsic firing patterns among local neurons are both necessary conditions for FR oscillations. Increasing the fidelity of individual pyramidal cell spike train timing by blocking accommodation dramatically increased FR amplitude, whereas blockade of potassium conductances decreased the fidelity of action potential timing in individual pyramidal cell action potential bursts and decreased FR amplitude. Blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors desynchronized onset of action potential bursts in individual pyramidal cells and abolished fast ripples. Thus, synchronous burst onset mediated by recurrent excitatory synaptic transmission and similar intrinsic spike timing mechanisms in neighboring pyramidal cells are necessary conditions for FR oscillations within the hippocampal network.",

abstract = "Developing neurons must regulate morphology, intrinsic excitability, and synaptogenesis to form neural circuits. When these processes go awry, disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or epilepsy, may result. The phosphatase Pten is mutated in some patients having ASD and seizures, suggesting that its mutation disrupts neurological function in part through increasing neuronal activity. Supporting this idea, neuronal knock-out of Pten in mice can cause macrocephaly, behavioral changes similar to ASD, and seizures. However, the mechanisms through which excitability is enhanced following Pten depletion are unclear. Previous studies have separately shown that Pten-depleted neurons can drive seizures, receive elevated excitatory synaptic input, and have abnormal dendrites. We therefore tested the hypothesis that developing Pten-depleted neurons are hyperactive due to increased excitatory synaptogenesis using electrophysiology, calcium imaging, morphological analyses, and modeling. This was accomplished by coinjecting retroviruses to either ``birthdate'' or birthdate and knock-out Pten in granule neurons of the murine neonatal dentate gyrus. We found that Pten knock-out neurons, despite a rapid onset of hypertrophy, were more active in vivo. Pten knock-out neurons fired at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, displayed greater peak spike rates, and were more sensitive to depolarizing synaptic input. The increased sensitivity of Pten knock-out neurons was due, in part, to a higher density of synapses located more proximal to the soma. We determined that increased synaptic drive was sufficient to drive hypertrophic Pten knock-out neurons beyond their altered action potential threshold. Thus, our work contributes a developmental mechanism for the increased activity of Pten-depleted neurons.",

abstract = "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent form of focal epilepsies and is generally associated with malfunctioning of the hippocampal formation. Recently, a preferential loss of parvalbumin (PV) neurons has been observed in the subiculum of TLE patients and in animal models of TLE. To demonstrate a possible causative role of defunct PV neurons in the generation of TLE, we permanently inhibited GABA release selectively from PV neurons of the ventral subiculum by injecting a viral vector expressing tetanus toxin light chain in male mice. Subsequently, mice were subjected to telemetric EEG recording and video monitoring. Eighty-eight percent of the mice presented clusters of spike-wave discharges (C-SWDs; 40.0 $\pm$ 9.07/month), and 64\% showed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs; 5.3 $\pm$ 0.83/month). Mice injected with a control vector presented with neither C-SWDs nor SRSs. No neurodegeneration was observed due to vector injection or SRS. Interestingly, mice that presented with only C-SWDs but no SRSs, developed SRSs upon injection of a subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole after 6 weeks. The initial frequency of SRSs declined by ∼30\% after 5 weeks. In contrast to permanent silencing of PV neurons, transient inhibition of GABA release from PV neurons through the designer receptor hM4Di selectively expressed in PV-containing neurons transiently reduced the seizure threshold of the mice but induced neither acute nor recurrent seizures. Our data demonstrate a critical role for perisomatic inhibition mediated by PV-containing interneurons, suggesting that their sustained silencing could be causally involved in the development of TLE.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) generally takes years after an initial insult during which maladaptation of hippocampal circuitries takes place. In human TLE and in animal models of TLE, parvalbumin neurons are selectively lost in the subiculum, the major output area of the hippocampus. The present experiments demonstrate that specific and sustained inhibition of GABA release from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (mostly basket cells) in sector CA1/subiculum is sufficient to induce hyperexcitability and spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice. As in patients with nonlesional TLE, these mice developed epilepsy without signs of neurodegeneration. The experiments highlight the importance of the potent inhibitory action mediated by parvalbumin cells in the hippocampus and identify a potential mechanism in the development of TLE.",

author = "Gungor, Nur Zeynep and Pare, Denis",
abstract = "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is thought to generate anxiety-like states via its projections to autonomic and neuroendocrine regulatory structures of the brain. However, because most BNST cells are GABAergic, they are expected to inhibit target neurons. In contrast with this, infusion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) into BNST was reported to potentiate anxiety while activating BNST targets. The present study aimed to shed light on this paradox. The CGRP innervation of BNST originates in the pontine parabrachial nucleus and targets its anterolateral sector (BNST-AL). Thus, we investigated the effects of CGRP on BNST-AL neurons using patch recordings in vitro in male rats. CGRP did not alter the passive properties of BNST-AL cells but increased the amplitude of IPSPs evoked by stimulation of the stria terminalis (ST). However, IPSP paired-pulse ratios were unchanged by CGRP, and there was no correlation between IPSP potentiation and variance, suggesting that CGRP acts postsynaptically. Consistent with this, CGRP hyperpolarized the GABA-A reversal of BNST-AL cells. These results indicate that CGRP increases ST-evoked GABA-A IPSPs and hyperpolarizes their reversal potential through a postsynaptic change in Cl(-) homeostasis. Overall, our findings suggest that CGRP potentiates anxiety-like behaviors and increases neural activity in BNST targets, by inhibiting BNST-AL cells, supporting the conclusion that BNST-AL exerts anxiolytic effects.",

abstract = "The dentate hilus has been extensively studied in relation to its potential role in memory and in temporal lobe epilepsy. Little is known, however, about the synapses formed between the two major cell types in this region, glutamatergic mossy cells and hilar interneurons, or the organization of local circuits involving these cells. Using triple and quadruple simultaneous intracellular recordings in rat hippocampal slices, we find that mossy cells evoke EPSPs with high failure rates onto hilar neurons. Mossy cells show profound synapse specificity; 87.5\% of their intralamellar connections are onto hilar interneurons. Hilar interneurons also show synapse specificity and preferentially inhibit mossy cells; 81\% of inhibitory hilar synapses are onto mossy cells. Hilar IPSPs have low failure rates, are blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine, and exhibit short-term depression when tested at 17 Hz. Surprisingly, more than half (57\%) of the mossy cell synapses we found onto interneurons were part of reciprocal excitatory/inhibitory local circuit motifs. Neither the high degree of target cell specificity, nor the significant enrichment of structured polysynaptic local circuit motifs, could be explained by nonrandom sampling or somatic proximity. Intralamellar hilar synapses appear to function primarily by integrating synchronous inputs and presynaptic burst discharges, allowing hilar cells to respond over a large dynamic range of input strengths. The reciprocal mossy cell/interneuron local circuit motifs we find enriched in the hilus may generate sparse neural representations involved in hippocampal memory operations.",

abstract = "The ability to adaptively regulate responses to the proximity of potential danger is critical to survival and imbalance in this system may contribute to psychopathology. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is implicated in defensive responding during uncertain threat anticipation whereas the amygdala may drive responding upon more acute danger. This functional dissociation between the BNST and amygdala is however controversial, and human evidence scarce. Here we used data from two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies [n = 108 males and n = 70 (45 females)] to probe how coordination between the BNST and amygdala may regulate responses during shock anticipation and actual shock confrontation. In a subset of participants from Sample 2 (n = 48) we demonstrate that anticipation and confrontation evoke bradycardic and tachycardic responses, respectively. Further, we show that in each sample when going from shock anticipation to the moment of shock confrontation neural activity shifted from a region anatomically consistent with the BNST toward the amygdala. Comparisons of functional connectivity during threat processing showed overlapping yet also consistently divergent functional connectivity profiles for the BNST and amygdala. Finally, childhood maltreatment levels predicted amygdala, but not BNST, hyperactivity during shock anticipation. Our results support an evolutionary conserved, defensive distance-dependent dynamic balance between BNST and amygdala activity. Shifts in this balance may enable shifts in defensive reactions via the demonstrated differential functional connectivity. Our results indicate that early life stress may tip the neural balance toward acute threat responding and via that route predispose for affective disorder.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Previously proposed differential contributions of the BNST and amygdala to fear and anxiety have been recently debated. Despite the significance of understanding their contributions to defensive reactions, there is a paucity of human studies that directly compared these regions on activity and connectivity during threat processing. We show strong evidence for a dissociable role of the BNST and amygdala in threat processing by demonstrating in two large participant samples that they show a distinct temporal signature of threat responding as well as a discriminable pattern of functional connections and differential sensitivity to early life threat.",

abstract = "KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 potassium channels have emerged as central regulators of pyramidal neuron excitability and spiking behavior. However, despite an abundance of evidence demonstrating that KCNQ2/3 heteromers underlie critical potassium conductances, it is unknown whether KCNQ2, KCNQ3, or both are obligatory for maintaining normal pyramidal neuron excitability. Here, we demonstrate that conditional deletion of Kcnq2 from cerebral cortical pyramidal neurons in mice results in abnormal electrocorticogram activity and early death, whereas similar deletion of Kcnq3 does not. At the cellular level, Kcnq2-null, but not Kcnq3-null, CA1 pyramidal neurons show increased excitability manifested as a decreased medium afterhyperpolarization and a longer-lasting afterdepolarization. As a result, these Kcnq2-deficient neurons are hyperexcitable, responding to current injections with an increased number and frequency of action potentials. Biochemically, the Kcnq2 deficiency secondarily results in a substantial loss of KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 protein levels, whereas loss of Kcnq3 only leads to a modest reduction of other KCNQ channels. Consistent with this finding, KCNQ allosteric activators can still markedly dampen neuronal excitability in Kcnq3-null pyramidal neurons, but have only weak effects in Kcnq2-null pyramidal neurons. Together, our data reveal the indispensable function of KCNQ2 channels at both the cellular and systems levels, and demonstrate that pyramidal neurons have near normal excitability in the absence of KCNQ3 channels.",

abstract = "UNLABELLED: Impaired breathing, cardiac function, and arousal during and after seizures are important causes of morbidity and mortality. Previous work suggests that these changes are associated with depressed brainstem function in the ictal and post-ictal periods. Lower brainstem serotonergic systems are postulated to play an important role in cardiorespiratory changes during and after seizures, whereas upper brainstem serotonergic and other systems regulate arousal. However, direct demonstration of seizure-associated neuronal activity changes in brainstem serotonergic regions has been lacking. Here, we performed multiunit and single-unit recordings from medullary raphe and midbrain dorsal raphe nuclei in an established rat seizure model while measuring changes in breathing rate and depth as well as heart rate. Serotonergic neurons were identified by immunohistochemistry. Respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation were all significantly decreased during and after seizures in this model. We found that population firing of neurons in the medullary and midbrain raphe on multiunit recordings was significantly decreased during the ictal and post-ictal periods. Single-unit recordings from identified serotonergic neurons in the medullary raphe revealed highly consistently decreased firing during and after seizures. In contrast, firing of midbrain raphe serotonergic neurons was more variable, with a mixture of increases and decreases. The markedly suppressed firing of medullary serotonergic neurons supports their possible role in simultaneously impaired cardiorespiratory function in seizures. Decreased arousal likely arises from depressed population activity of several neuronal pools in the upper brainstem and forebrain. These findings have important implications for preventing morbidity and mortality in people living with epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Seizures often cause impaired breathing, cardiac dysfunction, and loss of consciousness. The brainstem and, specifically, brainstem serotonin neurons are thought to play an important role in controlling breathing, cardiac function, and arousal. We used an established rat seizure model to study the overall neuronal activity in the brainstem as well as firing of specific serotonin neurons while measuring cardiorespiratory function. Our results demonstrated overall decreases in brainstem neuronal activity and marked downregulation of lower brainstem serotonin neuronal firing in association with decreased breathing and heart rate during and after seizures. These findings point the way toward new treatments to augment brainstem function and serotonin, aiming to prevent seizure complications and reduce morbidity and mortality in people living with epilepsy.",

abstract = "Endocannabinoid signaling is a key regulator of synaptic neurotransmission throughout the brain. Compelling evidence shows that its perturbation leads to development of epileptic seizures, thus indicating that endocannabinoids play an intrinsic protective role in suppressing pathologic neuronal excitability. To elucidate whether long-term reorganization of endocannabinoid signaling occurs in epileptic patients, we performed comparative expression profiling along with quantitative electron microscopic analysis in control (postmortem samples from subjects with no signs of neurological disorders) and epileptic (surgically removed from patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy) hippocampal tissue. Quantitative PCR measurements revealed that CB(1) cannabinoid receptor mRNA was downregulated to one-third of its control value in epileptic hippocampus. Likewise, the cannabinoid receptor-interacting protein-1a mRNA was decreased, whereas 1b isoform levels were unaltered. Expression of diacylglycerol lipase-alpha, an enzyme responsible for 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis, was also reduced by approximately 60\%, whereas its related beta isoform levels were unchanged. Expression level of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D and fatty acid amide hydrolase, metabolic enzymes of anandamide, and 2-arachidonoylglycerol's degrading enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase did not change. The density of CB(1) immunolabeling was also decreased in epileptic hippocampus, predominantly in the dentate gyrus, where quantitative electron microscopic analysis did not reveal changes in the ratio of CB(1)-positive GABAergic boutons, but uncovered robust reduction in the fraction of CB(1)-positive glutamatergic axon terminals. These findings show that a neuroprotective machinery involving endocannabinoids is impaired in epileptic human hippocampus and imply that downregulation of CB(1) receptors and related molecular components of the endocannabinoid system may facilitate the deleterious effects of increased network excitability.",

How these hemodynamic events correlate with actual changes in tissue oxygenation is also not known. Using laser Doppler flowmetry, oxygen microsensors and intrinsic optical imaging spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the dip in hemoglobin in the focus correlates with a profound but temporary decrease in tissue oxygenation despite a large increase in CBF. Furthermore, CBF simultaneously decreases in the cortex immediately adjacent to the focus. These events are then replaced with a longer duration, less focal increase in CBF, cerebral blood volume, and hyperoxygenation, the duration of which correlates with the duration of the seizure. These findings raise the question of whether transient focal hypoxia and vascular steal might contribute to progressive deleterious effects of chronic epilepsy on the adult and developing brain.

author = "Tu, Bin and Timofeeva, Olga and Jiao, Yiqun and Nadler, J Victor",
abstract = "In the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy, mossy fibers coexpress the inhibitory transmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) with glutamate. The effects of endogenous and applied NPY on recurrent mossy fiber synaptic transmission were investigated with the use of whole-cell voltage-clamp and field recordings in rat hippocampal slices. Applied NPY reversibly inhibited synaptic transmission at recurrent mossy fiber synapses on dentate granule cells but not at perforant path or associational-commissural synapses. It also reduced the frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in granule cells from epileptic, but not control, rats and depressed granule cell epileptiform activity dependent on the recurrent mossy fiber pathway. These actions of NPY were mediated by activation of presynaptic Y2 receptors. The Y2 receptor antagonist (S)-N2-[[1-[2-[4-[(R,S)-5,11-dihydro-6(6H)-oxodibenz[b,e]azepin-11-yl]-1-piperazinyl]-2-oxoethyl]cyclopentyl]acetyl]-N-[2-[1,2-dihydro-3,5(4H)-dioxo-1,2-diphenyl-3H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl]ethyl]argininamide (BIIE0246) not only blocked the effects of NPY but also enhanced recurrent mossy fiber synaptic transmission, the frequency of mEPSCs, and the magnitude of mossy fiber-evoked granule cell epileptiform activity when applied by itself. Several observations supported the selectivity of BIIE0246. These results suggest that even the spontaneous release of NPY (or an active metabolite) from recurrent mossy fibers is sufficient to depress glutamate release from this pathway. Tonic release of NPY accounts at least partially for the low probability of glutamate release from recurrent mossy fiber terminals, impedes the ability of these fibers to synchronize granule cell discharge, and may protect the hippocampus from seizures that involve the entorhinal cortex. This pathway may synchronize granule cell discharge more effectively in human brain than in rat because of its lower expression of NPY.",

Granule cell axon (mossy fiber) sprouting is a common neuropathological finding in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, but its role in epileptogenesis is unclear and controversial. Focally infused or systemic rapamycin inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and suppresses mossy fiber sprouting in rats. We tested whether long-term systemic treatment with rapamycin, beginning 1 d after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in mice, would suppress mossy fiber sprouting and affect the development of spontaneous seizures. Mice that had experienced status epilepticus and were treated for 2 months with rapamycin displayed significantly less mossy fiber sprouting (42\% of vehicle-treated animals), and the effect was dose dependent. However, behavioral and video/EEG monitoring revealed that rapamycin- and vehicle-treated mice displayed spontaneous seizures at similar frequencies. These findings suggest mossy fiber sprouting is neither pro- nor anti-convulsant; however, there are caveats. Rapamycin treatment also reduced epilepsy-related hypertrophy of the dentate gyrus but did not significantly affect granule cell proliferation, hilar neuron loss, or generation of ectopic granule cells. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that hilar neuron loss and ectopic granule cells might contribute to temporal lobe epileptogenesis.",

CIH induces an increase in NTS postsynaptic cell activity initiated by spontaneous presynaptic transmitter release that is counterbalanced by a reduction in evoked synaptic transmission between sensory afferents and NTS second-order cells.

author = "Hester, Michael S and Danzer, Steve C",
abstract = "Accumulation of abnormally integrated, adult-born, hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs) is hypothesized to contribute to the development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). DGCs have long been implicated in TLE, because they regulate excitatory signaling through the hippocampus and exhibit neuroplastic changes during epileptogenesis. Furthermore, DGCs are unusual in that they are continually generated throughout life, with aberrant integration of new cells underlying the majority of restructuring in the dentate during epileptogenesis. Although it is known that these abnormal networks promote abnormal neuronal firing and hyperexcitability, it has yet to be established whether they directly contribute to seizure generation. If abnormal DGCs do contribute, a reasonable prediction would be that the severity of epilepsy will be correlated with the number or load of abnormal DGCs. To test this prediction, we used a conditional, inducible transgenic mouse model to fate map adult-generated DGCs. Mossy cell loss, also implicated in epileptogenesis, was assessed as well. Transgenic mice rendered epileptic using the pilocarpine-status epilepticus model of epilepsy were monitored continuously by video/EEG for 4 weeks to determine seizure frequency and severity. Positive correlations were found between seizure frequency and (1) the percentage of hilar ectopic DGCs, (2) the amount of mossy fiber sprouting, and (3) the extent of mossy cell death. In addition, mossy fiber sprouting and mossy cell death were correlated with seizure severity. These studies provide correlative evidence in support of the hypothesis that abnormal DGCs contribute to the development of TLE and also support a role for mossy cell loss.",

Hilar mossy cells, in particular, are thought to show dramatic numerical reductions in pathological conditions, and one prominent theory of epileptogenesis is based on the assumption that mossy cell loss directly results in granule cell hyperexcitability. However, whether it is the disappearance of hilar mossy cells from the dentate gyrus circuitry after various insults or the subsequent synaptic-cellular alterations (e.g., reactive axonal sprouting) that lead to dentate hyperexcitability has not been rigorously tested, because of the lack of available techniques to rapidly remove specific classes of nonprincipal cells from neuronal networks. We developed a fast, cell-specific ablation technique that allowed the targeted lesioning of either mossy cells or GABAergic interneurons in horizontal as well as axial (longitudinal) slices of the hippocampus. The results demonstrate that mossy cell deletion consistently decreased the excitability of granule cells to perforant path stimulation both within and outside of the lamella where the mossy cell ablation took place. In contrast, ablation of interneurons caused the expected increase in excitability, and control aspirations of the hilar neuropil or of interneurons in the presence of GABA receptor blockers caused no alteration in granule cell excitability. These data do not support the hypothesis that loss of mossy cells from the dentate hilus after seizures or traumatic brain injury directly results in hyperexcitability.",

Here, we performed video-EEG recordings in mice carrying mutant human APPswe and PS1dE9 genes (APdE9 mice) and their wild-type littermates to determine the prevalence of unprovoked seizures. In two recording episodes at the onset of amyloid beta (Abeta) pathogenesis (3 and 4.5 months of age), at least one unprovoked seizure was detected in 65\% of APdE9 mice, of which 46\% had multiple seizures and 38\% had a generalized seizure. None of the wild-type mice had seizures. In a subset of APdE9 mice, seizure phenotype was associated with a loss of calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity in dentate granular cells and ectopic expression of neuropeptide Y in mossy fibers. In APdE9 mice, persistently decreased resting membrane potential in neocortical layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells underpinned increased network excitability as identified by patch-clamp electrophysiology. At stimulus strengths evoking single-component EPSPs in wild-type littermates, APdE9 mice exhibited decreased action potential threshold and burst firing of pyramidal cells. Bath application (1 h) of Abeta1-42 or Abeta25-35 (proto-)fibrils but not oligomers induced significant membrane depolarization of pyramidal cells and increased the activity of excitatory cell populations as measured by extracellular field recordings in the juvenile rodent brain, confirming the pathogenic significance of bath-applied Abeta (proto-)fibrils.

Here we used 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid (ATPA), a potent and selective agonist of kainate receptors that include the GluK1 subunit, in conjunction with mice deficient in GluK1 and GluK2 kainate receptor subunits to assess the role of GluK1 kainate receptors in provoking seizures and in kindling epileptogenesis. We found that systemic ATPA, acting specifically via GluK1 kainate receptors, causes locomotor arrest and forelimb extension (a unique behavioral characteristic of GluK1 activation) and induces myoclonic behavioral seizures and electrographic seizure discharges in the BLA and hippocampus. In contrast, the proconvulsant activity of systemic AMPA, kainate, and pentylenetetrazol is not mediated by GluK1 kainate receptors, and deletion of these receptors does not elevate the threshold for seizures in the 6 Hz model. ATPA also specifically activates epileptiform discharges in BLA slices in vitro via GluK1 kainate receptors. Olfactory bulb kindling developed similarly in wild-type, GluK1, and GluK2 knock-out mice, demonstrating that GluK1 kainate receptors are not required for epileptogenesis or seizure expression in this model. We conclude that selective activation of kainate receptors containing the GluK1 subunit can trigger seizures, but these receptors are not necessary for seizure generation in models commonly used to identify therapeutic agents for the treatment of epilepsy.",

However, correlations between the extent of mossy fiber sprouting and seizure frequency are weak. Additional potential sources of granule cell recurrent excitation that would not have been detected by markers of mossy fiber sprouting in previous studies include surviving mossy cells and proximal CA3 pyramidal cells. To test those possibilities in hippocampal slices from epileptic pilocarpine-treated rats, laser-scanning glutamate uncaging was used to randomly and focally activate neurons in the granule cell layer, hilus, and proximal CA3 pyramidal cell layer while measuring evoked EPSCs in normotopic granule cells. Consistent with mossy fiber sprouting, a higher proportion of glutamate-uncaging spots in the granule cell layer evoked EPSCs in epileptic rats compared with controls. In addition, stimulation spots in the hilus and proximal CA3 pyramidal cell layer were more likely to evoke EPSCs in epileptic rats, despite significant neuron loss in those regions. Furthermore, synaptic strength of recurrent excitatory inputs to granule cells from CA3 pyramidal cells and other granule cells was increased in epileptic rats. These findings reveal substantial levels of excessive, recurrent, excitatory synaptic input to granule cells from neurons in the hilus and proximal CA3 field.

In ``responsive'' neurostimulation the strategy is to interfere as early as possible with the accumulation of seizure activity to prematurely abort or even prevent an upcoming seizure. The design of technology required for responsive stimulation is more challenging compared with devices for open-loop neurostimulation. The achievement of therapeutic success is dependent on adequate sensing and stimulation algorithms and a fast coupling between both.

abstract = "Sudden and unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common type of death among patients with epilepsy. Here, we address the importance of the experimental models in search of the mechanisms underlying SUDEP. Most studies have investigated the cardiovascular responses in animal models of epilepsy. However, there are few proposed SUDEP models in literature. Hypoventilation, apnea, respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, autonomic dysregulation and arrhythmia are common findings in epilepsy models. Impairments on adenosinergic and serotonergic systems, brainstem spreading depolarization, seizure-activation of neural substrates related to cardiorespiratory control, altered autonomic control, and mutations on sodium and potassium channels are hypothesis suggested. Overall, current research highlights the evident multifactorial nature of SUDEP, which involves acute and chronic aspects ranging from systemic to molecular alterations. Thus, we are convinced that elucidation and prevention of SUDEP can be achieved only through the interaction between basic and clinical science.",

Epidemiological studies have established that anxiety disorders are twice as common in patients with epilepsy compared to the general population, while in referral centres their prevalence is even higher. In addition, it has been recently appreciated that anxiety exerts a significant negative impact on the quality of life of patients with epilepsy of any age. With regard to the pathogenesis of anxiety in epilepsy, a number of theories have been put forward including those based on psychodynamics, learning-cognition, and neurobiology. From a clinical point of view, anxiety may occur as a comorbid disorder with epilepsy or be directly linked with epilepsy as a preictal, ictal, postictal or interictal phenomenon. The treatment of anxiety in patients with epilepsy requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, clinical assessment. Regarding pharmacological therapies, it should be recognised that some drugs prescribed for anxiety disorders are associated with a high risk of seizures, whereas some antiepileptic drugs possess anxiolytic properties that could be of use in the management of epileptic patients with anxiety. The correct diagnosis and successful treatment of anxiety is expected to have significant benefits for the quality of life of epileptic patients.",

Thus far, two clinical reports have identified children with different recessive mutations in SZT2 and varying clinical phenotypes. One case report described patients with epileptic encephalopathy and the other noted patients with cognitive deficiencies, but normal MRI and no epilepsy. This case report identifies novel mutations (a compound heterozygous frameshift and a nonsense variant) in the SZT2 gene with distinct clinical and radiographic findings relative to those previously reported. Our patient presented with intractable epilepsy at 2 months of age. Seizures were refractory to numerous antiepileptic medications and the patient finally achieved seizure cessation at age 3 years with a combination of divalproex and lamotrigine. Our patient had similar facial dysmorphisms (macrocephaly, high forehead, and down-slanted palpebral fissures) to a previous case with truncating mutation. While developmental delay and cognitive deficiencies were present, our case had unique MRI findings suggesting migrational abnormalities not previously reported in other cases.",

abstract = "Generalized motor seizures, usually tonic-clonic, tonic-vibratory, myoclonic or clonic, and stimulus-sensitive/action myoclonus are typical features of progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs). Despite the introduction of many anticonvulsants, the treatment of these symptoms, particularly myoclonus, remains challenging, due to the incomplete and often transitory effects of most drugs. Moreover, treatment is only symptomatic, since therapy targeting the underlying aetiology for these genetic conditions is in its infancy. Traditional antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of PMEs are valproate, clonazepam, and phenobarbital (or primidone). These drugs may improve the overall performance of PME patients by decreasing their generalized seizures and, to a lesser extent, their myoclonic jerks. Newer drugs which have been shown to be effective include piracetam, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, and possibly perampanel for Lafora disease. The potential of other drugs (such as L-triptophan and N-acetylcysteine) and procedures (such as vagal and deep brain stimulation) has also been discussed. The available data on the efficacy of drugs are mainly based on small series or anecdotal reports. Two prospective, randomized, double blind studies investigating the novel SV2A ligand, brivaracetam, in genetically confirmed Unverricht-Lundborg patients have been performed with disappointing results. When treating PMEs, particular care should be paid to avoid drugs known to aggravate myoclonus or myoclonic seizures, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, vigabatrin, tiagabine, gabapentin, and pregabalin. The emergency treatment of motor status, which often complicates the course of PMEs, consists of intravenous administration of benzodiazepines, valproate, or levetiracetam.",

abstract = "The identification and characterization of sudden unexpected deaths in epilepsy (SUDEP) may be improved, helping to optimize prevention and intervention. We set out to assess the frequency and demographic and clinical characteristics of SUDEP cases in a sudden death cohort. All out-of-hospital deaths were investigated from March 1, 2013 to February 28, 2015 in Wake County, NC, attended by the Emergency Medical Services. Cases were screened and adjudicated by three physicians to identify sudden death cases from any cause among free-living adults, aged 18-64. In total, 399 sudden death victims were identified during this two-year period. Seizure history, demographic and clinical characteristics, and healthcare utilization patterns were assessed from death records, emergency response scene reports, and medical records. Sudden death cases with a history of seizures were summarized by an experienced chart abstractor (SC) and adjudicated by an experienced neurologist (OD). We then compared demographic and clinical characteristics and healthcare utilization patterns of neurologist-identified SUDEP cases to other sudden death victims in our population-based registry of sudden death from any cause. SUDEP accounted for 5.3\% of sudden deaths. However, seizures or complications of seizures were only considered the primary cause of death on death certificates in 1.5\% of sudden deaths. SUDEP cases were more likely to have a history of alcohol abuse. Mental health disorders and a low level of medication compliance and healthcare utilization were common among SUDEP victims. SUDEP accounts for approximately 5.3\% of sudden deaths from any cause in individuals aged between 18 and 64. Death certificates underestimate the burden of sudden death in epilepsy, attributing only 1.5\% of sudden deaths to seizures or complications of seizures. Accurate documentation of epileptic disorders on death certificates is essential for the surveillance of SUDEP. Further, interventions that promote better use of medical services and patient engagement with healthy living practices may reduce sudden deaths in epilepsy.",

On the contrary, unprovoked seizures and epilepsy - commonly involving the temporal lobe - are now reported at the prodromal stages of these diseases, when cognitive complaints are mild or even minimal and brain imaging inconstantly abnormal. Thus epilepsy must be considered as a part of the phenotypic spectrum at any stages of the neurodegenerative diseases.

Some of these models replicate the natural history of symptomatic focal epilepsy with an initial epileptogenic insult, which is followed by an apparent latent period and by a subsequent period of chronic spontaneous seizures. Seizures are a combination of electrical and behavioral events that are able to induce chemical, molecular, and anatomic alterations. In this review, we summarize the most frequently used models of chronic epilepsy and models of acute seizures induced by chemoconvulsants, traumatic brain injury, and electrical or sound stimuli. Genetic models of absence seizures and models of seizures and status epilepticus in the immature brain were also examined. Major uses and limitations were highlighted, and neuropathological, behavioral, and neurophysiological similarities and differences between the model and the human equivalent were considered.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe ictal and interictal cortical and subcortical perfusion patterns using single- photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). METHODS: Thirty-five interictal-ictal SPECT scans were obtained from 15 patients with DRE. A methodology was developed to get a relative perfusion index (PI) of 74 cortical and sub-cortical brain structures. K-means algorithm, together with modified v-fold cross-validation, was used to identify the two regions of interest (ROIs) that represent hypoperfused and hyperperfused areas. RESULTS: In common with the individual analysis, the statistical analysis evidenced that the hyperperfusion ROIs resulting from group analysis during interictal and ictal involved mainly the cingulate gyrus, cuneus, lingual gyrus, and gyrus rectus as well as the putamen. ROIs hypoperfused included the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, and the medulla. The medians of the group analysis of the hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion ROIs were 0.601-0.565 and 1.133-1.119 for the ictal and interictal states, correspondingly. A group of mostly cortical structures involved in the hyperperfused ROIs in both interictal and ictal states showed no change or negative change in the transition from interictal to ictal state (mean change of -0.002). On the other hand, the brain stem, basal ganglia, red nucleus, and thalamus revealed a mean global change of 0.19, indicating a mild increase in the PI. However, some of these structures (red nucleus, substantia nigra, and medulla oblongata) remained hypoperfused during the interictal to ictal transition. CONCLUSION: The methodology employed made it possible to identify common cortical and subcortical perfusion patterns not directly linked to epileptogenicity, for a better epileptogenic network and sudden unexpected death (SUDEP) mechanism in DRE.",

In the epileptic brain, the well-studied pathologic counterparts to these physiological events are pathological high-frequency oscillations and interictal spikes that could be electrophysiological biomarkers of epilepsy. Establishing these abnormal events as biomarkers of epilepsy will largely depend on a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying their generation, which will not only help distinguish pathological from physiological events, but will also determine what roles these pathological events play in epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity. This article focuses on the properties and neuronal mechanisms supporting the generation of high-frequency oscillations and interictal spikes, and introduces a new phenomenon called Up-spikes.",

abstract = "Recently, we reported hippocampal and temporal lobe abnormalities in 5 toddlers with sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC). The association of these anomalies with a high incidence (40\%) of individual/family histories of simple febrile seizures in the cases raised concern that febrile seizures can be associated with death. In a series of 64 toddlers with sudden death, we tested the hypothesis that an SUDC subset is characterized by hippocampal and temporal lobe maldevelopment and an individual and/or family history of simple familial seizures. Cases of sudden and unexplained death in children aged 1.0 to 5.9 years (median 1.7 years) were divided into groups based upon a history of febrile or nonfebrile seizures, familial febrile seizures, and autopsy classification of cause of death. Forty-nine of the 64 cases (77\%) were classified as SUDC, of which 40\% had an individual/family history of febrile seizures. Of the 26 SUDC cases with available hippocampal sections, 62\% (16/26) had hippocampal and temporal lobe anomalies, including 82\% (9/11) of cases with an individual/family history of febrile seizures. Cases with these anomalies were all found dead during a sleep period, typically in the prone (87\%) position. We conclude that a potential new entity may account for the majority of SUDC in toddlers, defined by sleep-related death in the prone position, individual/family history of febrile seizures, and hippocampal and temporal lobe anomalies. The mechanism of death appears analogous to sudden death in (temporal lobe) epilepsy, with a putative unwitnessed seizure during sleep leading to airway occlusion and death. This study mandates further research into the potential link between simple febrile seizures and death.",

Noradrenergic (NA) neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) are considered to play a role in these changes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NTS NA A2 neurons are required for cardiovascular and HPA axis responses to both acute and chronic stress. Adult male rats received bilateral microinjection into the NTS of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to lesion A2 neurons [cardiovascular study, n = 5; HPA study, n = 5] or vehicle [cardiovascular study, n = 6; HPA study, n = 4]. Rats were exposed to acute restraint stress followed by 14 d of chronic variable stress (CVS). On the last day of testing, rats were placed in a novel elevated plus maze (EPM) to test post-CVS stress responses. Lesions of NTS A2 neurons reduced the tachycardic response to acute restraint, confirming that A2 neurons promote sympathetic activation following acute stress. In addition, CVS increased the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power for heart rate variability, indicative of sympathovagal imbalance, and this effect was significantly attenuated by 6-OHDA lesion. Lesions of NTS A2 neurons reduced acute restraint-induced corticosterone secretion, but did not affect the corticosterone response to the EPM, indicating that A2 neurons promote acute HPA axis responses, but are not involved in CVS-mediated HPA axis sensitization. Collectively, these data indicate that A2 neurons promote both cardiovascular and HPA axis responses to acute stress. Moreover, A2 catecholaminergic neurons may contribute to the potentially deleterious enhancement of sympathetic drive following chronic stress.",

abstract = "OBJECT: Hippocampal sclerosis can be identified in most patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Surgical removal of the sclerotic hippocampus is widely performed to treat patients with drug-resistant mesial TLE. In general, both epilepsy-prone and epilepsy-resistant neurons are believed to be in the hippocampal formation. The hilar mossy cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus are usually considered one of the most vulnerable types of neurons. The aim of this study was to clarify the fate of mossy cells in the hippocampus in epileptic humans. METHODS: Of the 19 patients included in this study, 15 underwent temporal lobe resection because of drug-resistant TLE. Four patients were used as controls because they harbored tumors that had not invaded the hippocampus and they had experienced no seizures. Histological evaluation of resected hippocampal tissues was performed using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Mossy cells were identified in the control as well as the epileptic hippocampi by using cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide immunohistochemistry. In most cases the number of mossy cells was reduced and thorny excrescences were smaller in the epileptic hippocampi than in controls; however, there was a significant loss of pyramidal cells and a partial loss of granule cells in the same epileptic hippocampi in which mossy cell loss was apparent. The loss of mossy cells could be correlated with the extent of hippocampal sclerosis, patient age at seizure onset, duration of epilepsy, and frequency of seizures. CONCLUSIONS: In many cases large numbers of mossy cells were present in the hilus of the dentate gyrus when most pyramidal neurons of the CA1 and CA3 areas of the Ammon's horn were lost, suggesting that mossy cells may not be more vulnerable to epileptic seizures than the hippocampal pyramidal neurons.",

abstract = "Object Occipital resections for epilepsy are rare. Reasons for this are the relative infrequency of occipital epilepsy, difficulty in localizing epilepsy originating in the occipital lobe, imprecisely defined seizure outcome in patients treated with focal occipital resections in the MR imaging era, and concerns about producing visual deficits. The impact of lesion location on vision and seizure biology, the management decision-making process, and the outcomes following resection need elaboration. Methods The authors studied 21 consecutive patients who underwent focal occipital resections for epilepsy at Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center over a 13-year period during which MR imaging was used. Demographics, imaging, and data relating to the epilepsy and its surgical management were collected. The collateral sulcus, the border between the medial surface and the lateral convexity, and the inferior temporal sulcus were used to subdivide the occipital lobe into medial, lateral, and basal zones. Lesions that did not involve most or all of the occipital lobe (sublobar) were spatially categorized into these zones. Visual function, semiology, and scalp electroencephalography were evaluated in relation to these spatial categories. Preresection and postresection visual function and seizure frequency were evaluated and compared. Lastly, an exhaustive review and discussion of the published literature on occipital resections for epilepsy was carried out. Results Five lesions were lobar and 16 were sublobar. Patients with medial or lobar lesions had a much greater likelihood of preoperative visual field defects. Those with basal or lateral lesions had a greater likelihood of having a visual aura preceding some or all of their seizures and a trend (not significant) toward having a concordant lateralized onset by scalp electroencephalography. Invasive recordings were used in 8 cases. All patients had lesions (malformations of cortical development, tumors, or gliosis) that were completely resected, as evaluated on postoperative MR imaging. At last follow-up, 17 patients (81\%) were seizure free or had only occasional auras (Wieser Class 1 or 2). The remaining 4 patients (19\%) had a worthwhile improvement in seizure control (Class 3 or 4). Of the patients for whom both pre- and postoperative visual testing data were available, 50\% suffered no new visual deficits, and 17\% each developed a new quadrantanopia or a hemianopia. Conclusions Lesional occipital lobe epilepsy can be successfully managed with resection to obtain excellent seizure-free rates. Individually tailored resections (in lateral occipital lesions, for example) may help preserve intact vision in a subset of cases (38\% in this series). Invasive recordings may further guide surgical decision-making as delineated by an algorithm generated by the authors. The authors' results suggest that the spatial location of the lesion correlates both with the semiology of the seizure and with the presence of visual deficit.",

Methods: In this case-control study, 26 presurgical mTLE patients and 44 healthy controls were enrolled to undergo 3-T MRI for functional and structural connectivity mapping across an 8-region network of mTLE seizure propagation, including the hippocampus (left and right), insula (left and right), thalamus (left and right), one midline precuneus, and one midline mid-cingulate. Seizure outcome was assessed annually for up to 3 years. Network properties and current outcome prediction methods related to early and long-term seizure outcome were investigated. Results: A network model was previously identified across 8 patients with seizure-free mTLE. Results confirmed that whole-network propagation connectivity patterns inconsistent with the mTLE model predict early surgical failure. In those patients with networks consistent with the mTLE network, specific bilateral within-network hippocampal to precuneus impairment (rather than unilateral impairment ipsilateral to the seizure focus) was associated with mild seizure recurrence. No currently used clinical variables offered the same ability to predict long-term outcome. Conclusions: It is known that there are important clinical differences between early surgical failure that lead to frequent disabling seizures and late recurrence of less frequent mild seizures. This study demonstrated that divergent network connectivity variability, whole-network versus within-network properties, were uniquely associated with these disparate outcomes.

abstract = "Objective: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death for patients with refractory epilepsy, and there is increasing evidence for a centrally mediated respiratory depression as a pathophysiological mechanism. The brain regions responsible for a seizure's inducing respiratory depression are unclear---the respiratory nuclei in the brainstem are thought to be involved, but involvement of forebrain structures is not yet understood. The aim of this study was to analyze intracranial EEGs in combination with the results of respiratory monitoring to investigate the relationship between seizure spread to specific mesial temporal brain regions and the onset of respiratory dysfunction and apnea. Methods: The authors reviewed all invasive electroencephalographic studies performed at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (Chicago) since 2010 to identify those cases in which 1) multiple mesial temporal electrodes (amygdala and hippocampal) were placed, 2) seizures were captured, and 3) patients' respiration was monitored. They identified 8 investigations meeting these criteria in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, and these investigations yielded data on a total of 22 seizures for analysis. Results: The onset of ictal apnea associated with each seizure was highly correlated with seizure spread to the amygdala. Onset of apnea occurred 2.7 $\pm$ 0.4 (mean $\pm$ SEM) seconds after the spread of the seizure to the amygdala, which was significantly earlier than after spread to the hippocampus (10.2 $\pm$ 0.7 seconds; p < 0.01). Conclusions: The findings suggest that activation of amygdalar networks is correlated with central apnea during seizures. This study builds on the authors' prior work that demonstrates a role for the amygdala in voluntary respiratory control and suggests a further role in dysfunctional breathing states seen during seizures, with implications for SUDEP pathophysiology.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Seizure outcome after mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) surgery is complex and diverse, even across patients with homogeneous presurgical clinical profiles. The authors hypothesized that this is due in part to variations in network connectivity across the brain before and after surgery. Although presurgical network connectivity has been previously characterized in these patients, the objective of this study was to characterize presurgical to postsurgical functional network connectivity changes across the brain after mTLE surgery. METHODS: Twenty patients with drug-refractory unilateral mTLE (5 left side, 10 female, age 39.3 $\pm$ 13.5 years) who underwent either selective amygdalohippocampectomy (n = 13) or temporal lobectomy (n = 7) were included in the study. Presurgical and postsurgical (36.6 $\pm$ 14.3 months after surgery) functional connectivity (FC) was measured with 3-T MRI and compared with findings in age-matched healthy controls (n = 44, 21 female, age 39.3 $\pm$ 14.3 years). Postsurgical connectivity changes were then related to seizure outcome, type of surgery, and presurgical disease parameters. RESULTS: The results demonstrated significant decreases of FC from control group values across the brain after surgery that were not present before surgery, including many contralateral hippocampal connections distal to the surgical site. Postsurgical impairment of contralateral precuneus to ipsilateral occipital connectivity was associated with seizure recurrence. Presurgical impairment of the contralateral precuneus to contralateral temporal lobe connectivity was associated with those who underwent selective amygdalohippocampectomy compared to those who had temporal lobectomy. Finally, changes in thalamic connectivity after surgery were linearly related to duration of epilepsy and frequency of consciousness-impairing seizures prior to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The widespread contralateral hippocampal FC changes after surgery may be a reflection of an ongoing epileptogenic progression that has been altered by the surgery, rather than a direct result of the surgery itself. This network evolution may contribute to long-term seizure outcome. Therefore, the combination of presurgical network mapping with the understanding of the dynamic effects of surgery on the networks may ultimately be used to create predictors of the likelihood of long-term seizure recurrence in individual patients after mTLE surgery.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed the clinical relevance of preoperative task-induced high-frequency activity (HFA) for language mapping in patients with refractory epilepsy during stereoelectroencephalography recording. Although HFA evaluation was described as a putative biomarker of cognition, its clinical relevance for mapping language networks was assessed predominantly by studies using electrocorticography (ECOG). METHODS: Forty-two patients with epilepsy who underwent intracranial electrode implantation during both task-induced HFA and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) language mapping were evaluated. The spatial and functional relevance of each method in terms of specificity and sensitivity were evaluated. RESULTS: The results showed that the two methods were able to map classic language regions, and a large and bilateral language network was obtained with induced HFA. At a regional level, differences were observed between methods for parietal and temporal lobes: HFA recruited a larger number of cortical parietal sites, while DCS involved more cortical temporal sites. Importantly, the results showed that HFA predicts language interference induced by DCS with high specificity (92.4\%; negative predictive value 95.9\%) and very low sensitivity (8.9\%; positive predictive value 4.8\%). CONCLUSIONS: DCS language mapping appears to be more appropriate for an extensive temporal mapping than induced HFA mapping. Furthermore, induced HFA should be used as a complement to DCS to preselect the number of stimulated sites during DCS, by omitting those reported as HFA-. This may be a considerable advantage because it allows a reduction in the duration of the stimulation procedure. Several parameters to be used for each method are discussed and the results are interpreted in relation to previous results reported in ECOG studies.",

METHODS: The authors evaluated 218 consecutive patients undergoing SEEG procedures from 1993 through 2018 at a single academic medical center to assess the utility and safety of this technique in both guiding epilepsy surgery and providing single-unit recordings. The hybrid electrodes used in this study contained macrocontacts and microwires to simultaneously record intracranial EEG and single-unit activity (hybrid SEEG). The outcomes of SEEG-guided surgical interventions were examined, as well as the yield and scientific utility of single-unit recordings in 213 patients who participated in the research involving single-unit recordings. RESULTS: All patients underwent SEEG implantation by a single surgeon and subsequent video-EEG monitoring (mean of 10.2 electrodes per patient and 12.0 monitored days). Epilepsy networks were localized in 191 (87.6\%) patients. Two clinically significant procedural complications (one hemorrhage and one infection) were noted. Of 130 patients who underwent subsequent focal epilepsy surgery with a minimum 12-month follow-up, 102 (78.5\%) underwent resective surgery and 28 (21.5\%) underwent closed-loop responsive neurostimulation (RNS) with or without resection. Seizure freedom was achieved in 65 (63.7\%) patients in the resective group. In the RNS group, 21 (75.0\%) patients achieved 50\% or greater seizure reduction. When the initial period of 1993 through 2013 before responsive neurostimulator implantation in 2014 was compared with the subsequent period of 2014 through 2018, the proportion of SEEG patients undergoing focal epilepsy surgery grew from 57.9\% to 79.7\% due to the advent of RNS, despite a decline in focal resective surgery from 55.3\% to 35.6\%. A total of 18,680 microwires were implanted in 213 patients, resulting in numerous significant scientific findings. Recent recordings from 35 patients showed a yield of 1813 neurons, with a mean yield of 51.8 neurons per patient. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid SEEG enables safe and effective localization of epileptogenic zones to guide epilepsy surgery and provides unique scientific opportunities to investigate neurons from various brain regions in conscious patients. This technique will be increasingly utilized due to the advent of RNS and may prove a useful approach to probe neuronal networks in other brain disorders.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Aside from rare case reports, only one study, with 12 patients, has addressed the phenotypic presentation of epilepsy in clinically defined amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, presumed to correspond to the AD prodromal stage): the authors highlighted a pharmacosensitive non-convulsive partial epileptic syndrome most probably related to the temporal or temporo-frontal cortices. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to verify the existence and the syndromic features of epileptic prodromal AD in a tertiary Memory Clinic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of the electro-radio-clinical features of 13 cases of epileptic prodromal AD patients (3.1\% of a cohort of MCI, n = 430 subjects), selected on both clinical criteria and CSF biomarkers. RESULTS: In our patients, a pharmacosensitive temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome, inaugurating prodromal AD, started at a mean age of 63 years ($\pm$12.8 years) and preceded MCI diagnosis by 4 to 7 years. At the stage of aMCI, median MMSE score was 26 and imaging showed mild hippocampal atrophy. After almost one year under treatment, cognitive complaints were not relieved but the MMSE score remained stable at 26 for 11 patients (2 patients were excluded from analysis because of the onset of aphasic or neurovisual symptoms altering MMSE scoring). CONCLUSION: Our data, in conjunction with those of the 12 previously described subjects, suggest the existence of a currently unrecognized inaugural epilepsy syndrome of sporadic AD.

abstract = "The vagus nerve (VN) is the longest nerve of the organism and a major component of the parasympathetic nervous system which, together with the sympathetic nervous system, constitutes the autonomic nervous system. There is classically a balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems which is responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis. An imbalance of the autonomic nervous system is observed in various pathologic conditions. The VN is a mixed nerve with 80\% of afferent and 20\% of efferent fibers and a key component of the neuro-immune axis and the brain-gut axis through a bidirectional communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. A dual anti-inflammatory role of the VN is observed through the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (activation of vagal afferents) and the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (activation of vagal efferents). The sympathetic nervous system and the VN act in synergy, through the splenic nerve, to inhibit the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) by macrophages of the peripheral tissues and the spleen. Because of its anti-inflammatory effect, the VN is a therapeutic target in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders where TNF is a key component. In this review, we will focus on the anti-inflammatory role of the VN in inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The anti-inflammatory properties of the VN could be targeted pharmacologically, with enteral nutrition, by VN stimulation (VNS), with complementary medicines or by physical exercise. VNS, used in the treatment of drug resistant epilepsy and depression, could be an effective tool as a non-drug therapy to treat inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and postoperative ileus which are all characterized by an autonomic imbalance with a low vagal tone.",

To examine the effect of aging on intrinsic neuronal properties in BNST we compared patch clamp recordings from cohorts of female mice at two ages, 3-4 months (Young) and 29-30 months (Aged) focusing on 2 types of BNST neurons. Aged Type I neurons exhibited a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) of circa -80 mV compared to circa -70 mV in the Young. A key finding in this study is a hyper-excitability of Type II neurons with age reflected in an increase in firing frequency in response to depolarizing current injections; activation of Type II neurons is believed to dampen anxiety like responses.

abstract = "The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) is the main regulator of the stress response. The key of the HPA is the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (pPVN) controlled by higher-order limbic stress centers. The reactivity of the HPA axis is considered to be a function of age, but to date, little is known about the background of this age-dependency. Sporadic literature data suggest that the stress sensitivity as assessed by semi-quantitation of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos may also be influenced by age. Here, we aimed at investigating the HPA activity and c-Fos immunoreactivity 2 h after the beginning of a single 60 min acute restraint stress in eight age groups of male Wistar rats. We hypothesized that the function of the HPA axis (i.e., pPVN c-Fos and blood corticosterone (CORT) level), the neuronal activity of nine stress-related limbic areas (i.e., magnocellular PVN (mPVN), medial (MeA), central (CeA), basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, the oval (ovBNST), dorsolateral (dlBNST), dorsomedial (dmBNST), ventral and fusiform (fuBNST) divisions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)), and two brainstem stress centers such as the centrally projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus (cpEW) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) show age dependency in their c-Fos response. The somatosensory barrel cortex area (S1) was evaluated to test whether the age dependency is specific for stress-centers. Our results indicate that the stress-induced rise in blood CORT titer was lower in young age reflecting relatively low HPA activity. All 12 stress-related brain areas showed c-Fos response that peaked at 2 months of age. The magnitude of c-Fos immunoreactivity correlated negatively with age in seven regions (MeA, CeA, ovBNST, dlBNST, dmBNST, fuBNST and pPVN). Unexpectedly, the CeA, ovBNST and cpEW showed a considerable basal c-Fos expression in 1-month-old rats which decreased with age. The S1 showed a U-shaped age-related dynamics in contrast to the decline observed in stress centers. We conclude that the age- and brain area dependent dynamics in stress-induced neuronal activity pattern may contribute to the age dependance of the stress reactivity. Further studies are in progress to determine the neurochemical identity of neurons showing age-dependent basal and/or stress-induced c-Fos expression.",

Previous tract-tracing studies have revealed the axonal connection patterns of these two brain areas, but the intermingling of POMC neurons with other neuron types has made it challenging to precisely identify the inputs and outputs of POMC neurons. In this study, we used the modified rabies virus to map the brain areas that provide direct inputs to the POMC neurons in the ARC and NTS as well as the inputs to the ARC AgRP neurons for comparison. ARC POMC neurons receive inputs from dozens of discrete structures throughout the forebrain and brainstem. The brain areas containing the presynaptic partners of ARC POMC neurons largely overlap with those of ARC AgRP neurons, although POMC neurons receive relatively broader, denser inputs. Furthermore, POMC neurons in the NTS receive direct inputs predominantly from the brainstem and show very different innervation patterns for POMC neurons in the ARC. By selectively expressing fluorescent markers in the ARC and NTS POMC neurons, we found that almost all of their major presynaptic partners are innervated by POMC neurons in the two areas, suggesting that there are strong reciprocal projections among the major POMC neural pathways. By comprehensively chartering the whole-brain connections of the central melanocortin system in a cell-type-specific manner, this study lays the foundation for dissecting the roles and underlying circuit mechanisms of specific neural pathways in regulating energy homeostasis.",

abstract = "UNLABELLED: Trauma- and stress-related disorders are among the most common types of mental illness affecting the U.S. POPULATION: For many of these disorders, there is a striking sex difference in lifetime prevalence; for instance, women are twice as likely as men to be affected by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Gonadal steroids and their metabolites have been implicated in sex differences in fear and anxiety. One example, allopregnanolone (ALLO), is a neuroactive metabolite of progesterone that allosterically enhances GABAA receptor activity and has anxiolytic effects. Like other ovarian hormones, it not only occurs at different levels in males and females but also fluctuates over the female reproductive cycle. One brain structure that may be involved in neuroactive steroid regulation of fear and anxiety is the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). To explore this question, we examined the consequences of augmenting or reducing ALLO activity in the BNST on the expression of Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats. In Experiment 1, intra-BNST infusions of ALLO in male rats suppressed freezing behavior (a fear response) to the conditioned context, but did not influence freezing to a discrete tone conditioned stimulus (CS). In Experiment 2, intra-BNST infusion of either finasteride (FIN), an inhibitor of ALLO synthesis, or 17-phenyl-(3$\alpha$,5$\alpha$)-androst-16-en-3-ol, an ALLO antagonist, in female rats enhanced contextual freezing; neither treatment affected freezing to the tone CS. These findings support a role for ALLO in modulating contextual fear via the BNST and suggest that sex differences in fear and anxiety could arise from differential steroid regulation of BNST function. The susceptibility of women to disorders such as PTSD may be linked to cyclic declines in neuroactive steroid activity within fear circuitry.",

Within the last few decades, several preclinical models of PSTD have been developed to help elucidate the mechanisms underlying dysregulated fear states. One brain area that has emerged as a critical mediator of stress-related behavioral processing in both clinical and laboratory settings is the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). The BNST is interconnected with essential emotional processing regions, including prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. It is activated by stressor exposure and undergoes neurochemical and morphological alterations as a result of stressor exposure. Stress-related neuro-peptides including corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) are also abundant in the BNST, further implicating an involvement of BNST in stress responses. Behaviorally, the BNST is critical for acquisition and expression of fear and is well positioned to regulate fear relapse after periods of extinction. Here, we consider the role of the BNST in stress and memory processes in the context of preclinical models of PTSD.",

author = "Giardino, William J and Pomrenze, Matthew B",
abstract = "Sleep is fundamental to life, and poor sleep quality is linked to the suboptimal function of the neural circuits that process and respond to emotional stimuli. Wakefulness (``arousal'') is chiefly regulated by circadian and homeostatic forces, but affective mood states also strongly impact the balance between sleep and wake. Considering the bidirectional relationships between sleep/wake changes and emotional dynamics, we use the term ``emotional arousal'' as a representative characteristic of the profound overlap between brain pathways that: (1) modulate wakefulness; (2) interpret emotional information; and (3) calibrate motivated behaviors. Interestingly, many emotional arousal circuits communicate using specialized signaling molecules called neuropeptides to broadly modify neural network activities. One major neuropeptide-enriched brain region that is critical for emotional processing and has been recently implicated in sleep regulation is the bed nuclei of stria terminalis (BNST), a core component of the extended amygdala (an anatomical term that also includes the central and medial amygdalae, nucleus accumbens shell, and transition zones betwixt). The BNST encompasses an astonishing diversity of cell types that differ across many features including spatial organization, molecular signature, biological sex and hormonal milieu, synaptic input, axonal output, neurophysiological communication mode, and functional role. Given this tremendous complexity, comprehensive elucidation of the BNST neuropeptide circuit mechanisms underlying emotional arousal presents an ambitious set of challenges. In this review, we describe how rigorous investigation of these unresolved questions may reveal key insights to enhancing psychiatric treatments and global psychological wellbeing.",

In rodents, the anterodorsal BNST is especially affected by chronic exposure to stress, which results in alterations to the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-signaling pathway, including CRF receptors and upstream regulators. Stress increases cellular excitability in BNST CRF+ neurons by potentiating miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude, altering the resting membrane potential, and diminishing M-currents (a voltage-gated K+ current that stabilizes membrane potential). Rodent anterodorsal and anterolateral BNST neurons are also critical regulators of behavior, including avoidance of aversive contexts and fear learning (especially that of sustained threats). These rodent behaviors are historically associated with anxiety.

The dentate gyrus (DG) network plays an important role in regulating the excitability of the entire hippocampus by filtering and integrating information received via the perforant path. Here, we investigated possible epileptogenic abnormalities in the function of the DG neuronal network in the Synapsin II (Syn II) knockout mouse (Syn II−/−), a genetic mouse model of epilepsy. Syn II is a presynaptic protein whose deletion in mice reproducibly leads to generalized seizures starting at the age of 2 months. We made use of a high-resolution microelectrode array (4096 electrodes) and patch-clamp recordings, and found that in acute hippocampal slices of young pre-symptomatic (3--6 week-old) Syn II−/− mice excitatory synaptic output of the mossy fibers is reduced. Moreover, we showed that the main excitatory neurons present in the polymorphic layer of the DG, hilar mossy cells, display a reduced excitability. We also provide evidence of a predominantly inhibitory regulatory output from mossy cells to granule cells, through feed-forward inhibition, and show that the excitatory-inhibitory ratio is increased in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic Syn II−/− mice. These results support the key role of the hilar mossy neurons in maintaining the normal excitability of the hippocampal network and show that the late epileptic phenotype of the Syn II−/− mice is preceded by neuronal circuitry dysfunctions. Our data provide new insights into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in the Syn II−/− mice and open the possibility for early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.",

Stress-induced plasticity of GABAergic inhibition is thought to contribute to changes in neuronal excitability associated with stress, which is particularly relevant for stress-related disorders and seizure susceptibility. Here we review the literature demonstrating several mechanisms altering GABAergic inhibition associated with stress, including brain region-specific alterations in GABAA receptor (GABAAR) subunit expression, changes in chloride homeostasis, and plasticity at GABAergic synapses. Alterations in the expression of specific GABAAR subunits have been documented in multiple brain regions associated with acute or chronic stress. In addition, recent work demonstrates stress-induced alterations in GABAergic inhibition resulting from plasticity in intracellular chloride levels. Acute and chronic stress-induced dephosphorylation and downregulation of the K+/Cl− co-transporter, KCC2, has been implicated in compromising GABAergic control of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons necessary for mounting the physiological response to stress. Acute stress also unmasks the capacity for both long-term potentiation and long-term depression, in distinct temporal windows, at GABAergic synapses on parvocellular neuroendocrine cells (PNCs) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. This review highlights the complexity in the plasticity of GABAergic neurotransmission associated with stress and the relationship to neuronal excitability, including alterations in GABAAR expression, synaptic plasticity at GABAergic synapses, and changes in chloride homeostasis.",

abstract = "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of focal epilepsy in humans, and is often developed after an initial precipitating brain injury. This form of epilepsy is frequently resistant to pharmacological treatment; therefore, the prevention of TLE is the prospective approach to TLE therapy. The lithium-pilocarpine model in rats replicates some of the main features of TLE in human, including the pathogenic mechanisms of cell damage and epileptogenesis after a primary brain injury. In the present study, we investigated changes in the properties of glutamatergic transmission during the first 3 days after pilocarpine-induced acute seizures in Wistar rats (PILO-rats). Using RT-PCR and electrophysiological techniques, we compared the changes in the temporal cortex (TC) and hippocampus, brain areas differentially affected by seizures. On the first day, we found a transient increase in a ratio of $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the excitatory synaptic response in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocampus, but not in the TC. This was accompanied by an increase in the slope of input-output (I/O) curves for fEPSPs recorded in CA1, suggesting an enhanced excitability in AMPARs in this brain area. There was no difference in the AMPA/NMDA ratio in control rats on the third day. We also revealed the alterations in NMDA receptor subunit composition in PILO-rats. The GluN2B/GluN2A mRNA expression ratio increased in the dorsal hippocampus but did not change in the ventral hippocampus or the TC. The kinetics of NMDA-mediated evoked EPSCs in hippocampal neurons was slower in PILO-rats compared with control animals. Ifenprodil, a selective antagonist of GluN2B-containing NMDARs, diminished the area and amplitude of evoked EPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells more efficiently in PILO-rats compared with control animals. These results demonstrate that PILO-induced seizures lead to more severe alterations in excitatory synaptic transmission in the dorsal hippocampus than in the TC. Seizures affect the relative contribution of AMPA and NMDA receptor conductances in the synaptic response and increase the proportion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs in CA1 pyramidal neurons. These alterations disturb normal circuitry functions in the hippocampus, may cause neuron damage, and may be one of the important pathogenic mechanisms of TLE.",

NPY is expressed in the BNST but NPY-expressing neurons in this critical hub in the stress response network have not been addressed before. Therefore, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute slices of anterior BNST from Npy-hrGFP transgenic mice to identify and characterize NPY-expressing neurons. We show that NPY-positive and NPY-negative neurons in anterior BNST match the previous classification scheme of type I (Regular Spiking), type II (Low-Threshold Bursting), and type III (fast Inward Rectifying) cells, although the proportion of these physiological phenotypes was similar within both neuronal subpopulations. However, NPY-positive and NPY-negative neurons possessed distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties. NPY-positive neurons displayed higher input resistance and lower membrane capacitance, corresponding to small cell bodies and shorter less ramified dendrites, as compared to their NPY-negative counterparts. Furthermore, NPY-positive neurons generated higher frequent series of action potentials upon membrane depolarization and displayed significantly lower GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic responsiveness during evoked, spontaneous, and elementary synaptic activity. Taken together, these properties indicate an overall state of high excitability in NPY-positive neurons in anterior BNST. In view of the role of the anterior BNST in anxiety- and stress-related behaviors, these findings suggest a scenario where NPY-positive neurons are preferentially active and responsive to afferent inputs, thereby contributing to adaptation of the organism to stressful environmental encounters.",

The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a compelling region to study the consequences of early alcohol, as it is innervated by cortical structures which undergo continued maturation during adolescence and is critically involved in stress and negative affect-associated relapse. In adult mice, chronic ethanol induces long-term changes in GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs) of the BNST. It remains unclear, however, whether the adolescent BNST is susceptible to such persistent alcohol-induced modifications and, if so, whether they are preserved into adulthood. We therefore examined the short- and long-term consequences of adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) on NMDAR transmission and plasticity in the BNST of male and female mice. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings revealed greater glutamatergic tone in the BNST of AIE-treated males and females relative to air-controls. This change, which corresponded to an increase in presynaptic glutamate release, resulted in altered postsynaptic NMDAR metaplasticity and enhanced GluN2B transmission in males but not females. Only AIE-treated males displayed upregulated GluN2B expression (determined by western blot analysis). While these changes did not persist into adulthood under basal conditions, exposing adult males (but not females) to acute restraint stress reinstated AIE-induced alterations in NMDAR metaplasticity and GluN2B function. These data demonstrate that adolescent alcohol exposure specifically modifies NMDARs in the male BNST, that the plastic changes to NMDARs are long-lasting, and that they can be engaged by stress.",

Clinical manifestations in FCD vary with age at epilepsy onset with a more favorable prognosis in patients with late-onset (LO) compared to that in cases with early-onset (EO). This study was designed to test the hypothesis in FCD that spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated epileptogenicity depends on the age at epilepsy onset and varies between patients with early and late-onset age in FCD. To this end, brain specimens were obtained from the maximal spiking region (MAX) and minimal spiking region (MIN) of the epileptic foci of EO (n = 14, mean age = 10.6 $\pm$ 2.9 years) and LO (n = 10, mean age = 27 $\pm$ 5.6 years) patients undergoing electrocorticography (ECoG) guided surgery. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record spontaneous GABAergic currents from normal-looking pyramidal neurons in slice preparations of resected brain samples. We detected higher frequency and amplitude of GABAergic events in MAX samples compared to MIN samples of LO patients, while they were comparable in MIN and MAX samples of EO patients. Further GABAergic activity in the MIN and MAX samples of EO patients was higher than the MIN samples of LO patients. This suggests that in LO patients, GABAA receptor-mediated epileptogenicity is confined only to the high spiking areas, but in EO patients, it affects low spiking regions as well.",

author = "Lu, Yi-Ling and Scharfman, Helen E",
abstract = "Spreading depolarization (SD) is a sudden, large, and synchronous depolarization of principal cells which also involves interneurons and astrocytes. It is followed by depression of neuronal activity, and it slowly propagates across brain regions like cortex or hippocampus. SD is considered to be mechanistically relevant to migraine, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury (TBI), but there are many questions about its basic neurophysiology and spread. Research into SD in hippocampus using slices is often used to gain insight and SD is usually triggered by a focal stimulus with or without an altered extracellular buffer. Here, we optimize an in vitro experimental model allowing us to record SD without focal stimulation, which we call spontaneous. This method uses only an altered extracellular buffer containing 0 mM Mg2+ and 5 mM K+ and makes it possible for simultaneous patch and extracellular recording in a submerged chamber plus intrinsic optical imaging in slices of either sex. We also add methods for quantification and show the quantified optical signal is much more complex than imaging alone would suggest. In brief, acute hippocampal slices were prepared with a chamber holding a submerged slice but with flow of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) above and below, which we call interface-like. As soon as slices were placed in the chamber, aCSF with 0 Mg2+/5 K+ was used. Most mouse slices developed SD and did so in the first hour of 0 Mg2+/5 K+ aCSF exposure. In addition, prolonged bursts we call seizure-like events (SLEs) occurred, and the interactions between SD and SLEs suggest potentially important relationships. Differences between rats and mice in different chambers are described. Regarding optical imaging, SD originated in CA3 and the pattern of spread to CA1 and the dentate gyrus was similar in some ways to prior studies but also showed interesting differences. In summary, the methods are easy to use, provide new opportunities to study SD, new insights, and are inexpensive. They support previous suggestions that SD is diverse, and also suggest that participation by the dentate gyrus merits greater attention.",

abstract = "Recent advances in parallel computing, including the creation of the parallel version of the NEURON simulation environment, have allowed for a previously unattainable level of complexity and detail in neural network models. Previously, we published a functional NEURON model of the rat dentate gyrus with over 50,000 biophysically realistic, multicompartmental neurons, but network simulations could only utilize a single processor. By converting the model to take advantage of parallel NEURON, we are now able to utilize greater computational resources and are able to simulate the full-scale dentate gyrus, containing over a million neurons. This has eliminated the previous necessity for scaling adjustments and allowed for a more direct comparison to experimental techniques and results. The translation to parallel computing has provided a superlinear speedup of computation time and dramatically increased the overall computer memory available to the model. The incorporation of additional computational resources has allowed for more detail and elements to be included in the model, bringing the model closer to a more complete and accurate representation of the biological dentate gyrus. As an example of a major step toward an increasingly accurate representation of the biological dentate gyrus, we discuss the incorporation of realistic granule cell dendrites into the model. Our previous model contained simplified, two-dimensional dendritic morphologies that were identical for neurons of the same class. Using the software tools L-Neuron and L-Measure, we are able to introduce cell-to-cell variability by generating detailed, three-dimensional granule cell morphologies that are based on biological reconstructions. Through these and other improvements, we aim to construct a more complete full-scale model of the rat dentate gyrus, to provide a better tool to delineate the functional role of cell types within the dentate gyrus and their pathological changes observed in epilepsy.",

The distinctive appearance of mossy cells, the extensive divergence of their axons, and their vulnerability to excitotoxicity relative to granule cells has led to a great deal of interest in mossy cells. Nevertheless, there is no consensus about the normal functions of mossy cells and the implications of their vulnerability. There even seems to be some ambiguity about exactly what mossy cells are. Here we review initial studies of mossy cells, characteristics that define them, and suggest a practical definition to allow investigators to distinguish mossy cells from other hilar neurons even if all morphological and physiological information is unavailable due to technical limitations of their experiments. In addition, hypotheses are discussed about the role of mossy cells in the DG network, reasons for their vulnerability and their implications for disease.",

abstract = "Glutamatergic hilar mossy cells of the dentate gyrus can either excite or inhibit distant granule cells, depending on whether their direct excitatory projections to granule cells or their projections to local inhibitory interneurons dominate. However, it remains controversial whether the net effect of mossy cell loss is granule cell excitation or inhibition. Clarifying this controversy has particular relevance to temporal lobe epilepsy, which is marked by dentate granule cell hyperexcitability and extensive loss of dentate hilar mossy cells. Two diametrically opposed hypotheses have been advanced to explain this granule cell hyperexcitability-the ``dormant basket cell'' and the ``irritable mossy cell'' hypotheses. The ``dormant basket cell'' hypothesis proposes that mossy cells normally exert a net inhibitory effect on granule cells and therefore their loss causes dentate granule cell hyperexcitability. The ``irritable mossy cell'' hypothesis takes the opposite view that mossy cells normally excite granule cells and that the surviving mossy cells in epilepsy increase their activity, causing granule cell excitation. The inability to eliminate mossy cells selectively has made it difficult to test these two opposing hypotheses. To this end, we developed a transgenic toxin-mediated, mossy cell-ablation mouse line. Using these mutants, we demonstrated that the extensive elimination of hilar mossy cells causes granule cell hyperexcitability, although the mossy cell loss observed appeared insufficient to cause clinical epilepsy. In this review, we focus on this topic and also suggest that different interneuron populations may mediate mossy cell-induced translamellar lateral inhibition and intralamellar recurrent inhibition. These unique local circuits in the dentate hilar region may be centrally involved in the functional organization of the dentate gyrus.",

The specific functions of tonic versus phasic GABAergic inhibition in different cell types and the impact on specific neural circuits are only beginning to be unraveled. Here we review the diversity in the magnitude of tonic GABAergic inhibition in various brain regions and cell types, and highlight the impact on neuronal excitability in different neuronal circuits.

The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) comprises one hub for processing fear and reward processes. However, it remains unknown how dorsal BNST (dBNST) circuits process these antagonistic behaviors. Here, we exploited a combined Pavlovian fear and reward conditioning task that exposed mice to conditioned tone stimuli (CS)s, either paired with sucrose delivery or footshock unconditioned stimuli (US). Pharmacological inactivation identified the dorsal BNST as a crucial element for both fear and reward behavior. Deep brain calcium imaging revealed opposite roles of two distinct dBNST neuronal output pathways to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) or paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). dBNST neural activity profiles differentially process valence and Pavlovian behavior components: dBNST-PAG neurons encode fear CS, whereas dBNST-PVH neurons encode reward responding. Optogenetic activation of BNST-PVH neurons increased reward seeking, whereas dBNST-PAG neurons attenuated freezing. Thus, dBNST-PVH or dBNST-PAG circuitry encodes oppositely valenced fear and reward states, while simultaneously triggering an overall positive affective response bias (increased reward seeking while reducing fear responses). We speculate that this mechanism amplifies reward responding and suppresses fear responses linked to BNST dysfunction in stress and addictive behaviors.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for the deaths of 8-17\% of patients with epilepsy. Although the mechanisms of SUDEP are essentially unknown, one proposed mechanism is respiratory arrest initiated by a convulsive seizure. In mice, we have previously observed that extended apnea occurs during the tonic phase of seizures. Although often survived, tonic seizures became fatal when breathing did not immediately recover postictally. We also found that respiratory muscles were tonically contracted during the apnea, suggesting that muscle contraction could be the cause of apnea. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex drive motor units during the tonic phase, which produces apnea. Mice harboring the patient-derived N1768D point mutation of an Scn8a allele were crossed with transgenic mice such that inhibitory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) receptors were selectively expressed in excitatory forebrain neurons. We then triggered audiogenic and hippocampal (HC) stimulated seizures under control conditions and when excitatory forebrain neurons were inhibited with the synthetic ligand Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO). We found that inhibition with CNO was sufficient to increase seizure threshold of HC stimulated, but not audiogenic, seizures. In addition, regardless of seizure type, CNO nearly eliminated epileptiform activity that occurred proximal to the tonic phase; however, the seizure behaviors, notably the tonic phase and concomitant apnea, were unchanged. We interpret these results to indicate that while cortical neurons are likely critical for epileptogenesis and seizure initiation, the behavioral manifestations of tonic seizures are generated by neural circuitry in the mid- and/or hindbrain.",

Therefore, to help understand SUDEP we discuss mechanisms by which seizure activity propagates to the brainstem. Specifically, we highlight clinical and pre-clinical evidence suggesting how seizure activation of: (i) descending inhibitory drive or (ii) spreading depolarization might contribute to brainstem dysfunction. Furthermore, since epilepsy is a highly heterogenous disorder, we also considered factors expected to favor or oppose mechanisms of seizure propagation. We also consider whether epilepsy-associated genetic variants directly impact brainstem function.

While risk factors, monitoring systems, and standard practices are in place, the pathophysiology of SUDEP is still not well understood. Better knowledge of SUDEP and its potential mechanisms of action is crucial to reducing risk in this patient population and developing potential treatment options. Clinical studies and animal models of SUDEP suggest that diminished post-ictal respiratory control may be the dominant mechanism contributing to mortality. Recently, it was demonstrated that the depletion of the neuropeptide galanin in the amygdala occurs in human SUDEP. The amygdala plays a key role in the central integration of respiratory signaling; the depletion of galanin may represent a critical change that predisposes individuals to SUDEP. Materials and methods: To evaluate the impact of enhancing galaninergic signaling to potentially protect against SUDEP, we studied seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) following central (intracerebroventricular, intra-amygdala) and systemic (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous) administration of galanin analogs. Seizure na{\"\i}ve and seizure experienced (fully kindled) mice were tested. Results: Central and systemically administered galanin analogs protect against S-IRA in na{\"\i}ve C57Bl/6J mice. Differential efficacy between receptor subtype-selective analogs varied based on the route of administration. Sub-chronic systemic administration at doses that reduced 6 Hz seizures also protected against S-IRA. Acute treatment benefits also extended to fully kindled mice experiencing tonic extension.

Perhaps because it is anatomically indistinct and difficult to approach surgically, as it clasps the middle cerebral artery, it has, until now, been understandably neglected. In this review, we emphasize how its unique anatomical and functional properties, as primary olfactory cortex, predispose it to involvement in focal epilepsy.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major cause of death in those with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). There is a need for inventories and biomarkers associated with the risk for SUDEP. OBJECTIVE: To explore the revised SUDEP Risk Inventory (SUDEP-7) in a cohort with DRE and determine the association with Heart Rate and other covariates. METHODS: Twenty-five subjects with severe DRE were enrolled in a clinical trial for epilepsy. Baseline demographics, duration of epilepsy, seizure types, seizure frequency, seizure severity, AEDs, and vital signs were collected. Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated from 1-h recordings of ECG. A SUDEP Risk Inventory (SUDEP-7) was administered, which included seven validated and weighted risk factors initially identified by Walczak et al. as factors associated with SUDEP risk. RESULTS: The total score on the revised SUDEP-7 ranged from 1 to 7, mean = 3.4 (SD 1.8). The SUDEP Risk Inventory score was inversely correlated with RMSSD (Pearson r = -0.45, p = 0.027). The following variables were significantly associated with RMSSD: epilepsy duration (p = 0.02), age (p = 0.03), and developmental intellectual disability (p < 0.001). The correlation between RMSSD and SUDEP-7 tended to persist also after the adjustment for patient age (r = -0.40, p = 0.05). Two subjects died of SUDEP: their SUDEP-7 scores were above average and in the upper twenty-fifth and fiftieth percentiles, respectively (6 and 4, mean = 3.4). CONCLUSION: RMSSD, a measure of low frequency HRV, was significantly associated with SUDEP Risk Inventory (SUDEP-7) scores. Using a multivariate model, the covariates of developmental intellectual disability, age, and duration of epilepsy were also significantly associated with decreased HRV. The correlation between decreased HRV and a higher SUDEP-7 score remained unchanged even after the adjustment for patient age. The results suggest that older age, greater duration of epilepsy, and the presence of developmental intellectual disability may increase the risk of SUDEP through their direct influence on decreasing the vagus nerve-mediated HRV. Further validation of the SUDEP-7 inventory is indicated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00871377.",

Purkinje cell alterations or loss appear in sudden infant death and sudden death in epilepsy victims, possibly contributing to the fatal event. We evaluated breathing patterns in 12 wild-type (WT) and Lurcher mutant mice with 100\% developmental cerebellar Purkinje cell loss under baseline (room air), and recovery from hypercapnia, a concern in sudden death events. Six mutant and six WT mice were exposed to 4-min blocks of increasing CO2 (2, 4, 6, and 8\%), separated by 4-min recovery intervals in room air. Breath-by-breath patterns, including depth of breathing and end-expiratory pause (EEP) durations during recovery, were recorded. No baseline genotypic differences emerged. However, during recovery, EEP durations significantly lengthened in mutants, compared to WT mice, following the relatively low levels of CO2 exposure. Additionally, mutant mice exhibited signs of post-sigh disordered breathing during recovery following each exposure. Developmental cerebellar Purkinje cell loss significantly affects compensatory breathing patterns following mild CO2 exposure, possibly by inhibiting recovery from elevated CO2. These data implicate cerebellar Purkinje cells in the ability to recover from hypercarbia, suggesting that neuropathologic changes or loss of these cells contribute to inadequate ventilatory recovery to increased environmental CO2. Multiple disorders, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), appear to involve both cardiorespiratory failure and loss or injury to cerebellar Purkinje cells; the findings support the concept that such neuropathology may precede and exert a prominent role in these fatal events.",

To test this hypothesis, we used the mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy to determine whether use of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 can attenuate hippocampal pathology following status epilepticus. Excess glucocorticoid secretion was evident one day after status epilepticus in the mice, preceding the development of spontaneous seizures (which can take weeks to develop). RU486 treatment blocked the SE-associated elevation of glucocorticoid levels in pilocarpine treated mice. RU486 treatment also mitigated the development of hippocampal pathologies induced by status epilepticus, reducing loss of hilar mossy cells and limiting pathological cell proliferation in the dentate hilus. Mossy cell loss and accumulation of ectopic hilar cells are positively correlated with epilepsy severity, suggesting that early treatment with glucocorticoid antagonists could have anti-epileptogenic effects.",

The leading cause of epilepsy-related premature mortality is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Postmortem investigation of people with SUDEP, including histological and toxicological analysis, does not reveal a cause of death, and the mechanisms of SUDEP remain largely unresolved. In this review we present the possible mechanisms underlying SUDEP, including respiratory dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmia and postictal generalized electroencephlogram suppression. Emerging studies in humans and animal models suggest there may be an underlying genetic basis to SUDEP in some cases. We will highlight a mounting body of evidence for the involvement of genetic risk factors in SUDEP, with a particular focus on the role of cardiac arrhythmia genes in SUDEP.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is rare in well-controlled epilepsy. However, SUDEP is a common cause of death in drug-resistant epilepsy. Over the last 30 years, multiple cohort and population studies have identified clinical risk factors associated with an increased risk for SUDEP. OBJECTIVE: To identify and rank the leading SUDEP risk factors from major cohort and population-based studies. The incidence of SUDEP is also evaluated in special clinical situations, including antiepileptic drug treatment, epilepsy surgery, devices, and assignment to placebo in clinical trials. METHODS: A PubMed search for English language human cohort studies for the terms Sudden, Death, and Epilepsy was performed for the years 1987-2017. Risk factors for SUDEP were identified and ranked by the weighted log adjusted odds ratio (OR)/relative risk ratio (RR). FINDINGS: The top 10 leading risk factors ranked from highest to lowest log adjusted OR/RR are the following: $\geq$3 GTC seizures per year; $\geq$13 seizures in the last year; No Antiepileptic Drug (AED) treatment; $\geq$3 AEDs; $\geq$3 GTCs in the past year; 11-20 GTC seizures in the last 3 months; age of onset 0-15 years old; IQ < 70; 3-5 AED changes in the last year; $\geq$3 AEDs. Two risk factors from separate sources ($\geq$3 GTC seizures and $\geq$3 AEDs) occur twice in the top 10 risk factors. CONCLUSION: The top 10 risk factors for SUDEP are identified and ranked. A ranking of the top risk factors could help clinicians identify patients at highest risk for SUDEP.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is common among young people with epilepsy. Individuals who are at high risk of SUDEP exhibit regional brain structural and functional connectivity (FC) alterations compared with low-risk patients. However, less is known about network-based FC differences among critical cortical and subcortical autonomic regulatory brain structures in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients at high risk of SUDEP. METHODS: 32 TLE patients were risk-stratified according to the following clinical criteria: age of epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and presence of nocturnal seizures, resulting in 14 high-risk and 18 low-risk cases. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signal time courses were extracted from 11 bilateral cortical and subcortical brain regions involved in autonomic and other regulatory processes. After computing all pairwise correlations, FC matrices were analyzed using the network-based statistic. FC strength among the 11 brain regions was compared between the high- and low-risk patients. Increases and decreases in FC were sought, using high-risk > low-risk and low-risk > high-risk contrasts (with covariates age, gender, lateralization of epilepsy, and presence of hippocampal sclerosis). RESULTS: High-risk TLE patients showed a subnetwork with significantly reduced FC (t = 2.5, p = 0.029) involving the thalamus, brain stem, anterior cingulate, putamen and amygdala, and a second subnetwork with significantly elevated FC (t = 2.1, p = 0.031), which extended to medial/orbital frontal cortex, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, subcallosal cortex, brain stem, thalamus, caudate, and putamen. CONCLUSION: TLE patients at high risk of SUDEP showed widespread FC differences between key autonomic regulatory brain regions compared to those at low risk. The altered FC revealed here may help to shed light on the functional correlates of autonomic disturbances in epilepsy and mechanisms involved in SUDEP. Furthermore, these findings represent possible objective biomarkers which could help to identify high-risk patients and enhance SUDEP risk stratification via the use of non-invasive neuroimaging, which would require validation in larger cohorts, with extension to patients with other epilepsies and subjects who succumb to SUDEP.",

It is the first guideline to do this in the United States. It follows precedent set out in the UK by National Institute of Clinical Excellence in 2004. While a significant achievement, the lack of clarity of how to deliver this guidance in an enduring and person-centered manner, raises concerns on how its long-term effectiveness in risk mitigation. Shared decision-making with an emphasis on delivering person-centered communication to foster self-management strategies is increasingly recognized as the ideal model of patient-clinician communication in chronic diseases such as epilepsy. The tension between delivering evidence-based risk information, yet, tailoring it to the individual is complex. It needs to incorporate the potential for change not only in seizure factors but also other health and social factors. Safety advice needs to be dynamic and situation sensitive as opposed to a ``one off'' discussion. As a significant minority of people with epilepsy have drug-resistant seizures, the importance of keeping the advice contextual at different intervals of the person's life cannot be overstated as many of them are managed in primary care. We present some exploratory work, which identifies the need to improve communication at a primary care level and to review risks regularly. Regular reviews using a structured risk factor checklist as a screening tool could identify, sooner, people who's health issues are worsening and justify referrals to specialists.",

abstract = "Objective: Seizure-related autonomic dysregulation occurs in epilepsy patients and may contribute to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). We tested how different types of seizures affect baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV). We hypothesized that BRS and HRV would be reduced after bilateral convulsive seizures (BCS). Methods: We recorded blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG) and oxygen saturation continuously in patients (n = 18) with intractable epilepsy undergoing video-EEG monitoring. A total of 23 seizures, either focal seizures (FS, n = 14) or BCS (n = 9), were analyzed from these patients. We used 5 different HRV measurements in both the time and frequency domains to study HRV in pre- and post-ictal states. We used the average frequency domain gain, computed as the average of the magnitude ratio between the systolic BP (BPsys) and the RR-interval time series, in the low-frequency (LF) band as frequency domain index of BRS in addition to the instantaneous slope between systolic BP and RR-interval satisfying spontaneous BRS criteria as a time domain index of BRS. Results: Overall, the post-ictal modulation of HRV varied across the subjects but not specifically by the type of seizures. Comparing pre- to post-ictal epochs, the LF power of BRS decreased in 8 of 9 seizures for patients with BCS; whereas following 12 of 14 FS, BRS increased. Similarly, spontaneous BRS decreased following 7 of 9 BCS. The presence or absence of oxygen desaturation was not consistent with the changes in BRS following seizures, and the HRV does not appear to be correlated with the BRS changes. These data suggest that a transient decrease in BRS and temporary loss of cardiovascular homeostatic control can follow BCS but is unlikely following FS. Significance: These findings indicate significant post-ictal autonomic dysregulation in patients with epilepsy following BCS. Further, reduced BRS following BCS, if confirmed in future studies on SUDEP cases, may indicate one quantifiable risk marker of SUDEP.",

abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of epilepsy-related death in patients with refractory epilepsy. Convergent lines of evidence suggest that SUDEP occurs due to seizure induced perturbation of respiratory, cardiac, and electrocerebral function as well as potential predisposing factors. It is consistently observed that SUDEP happens more during the night and the early hours of the morning. The aim of this review is to discuss evidence from patient cases, clinical studies, and animal research which is pertinent to the nocturnality of SUDEP. There are a number of factors which might contribute to the nighttime predilection of SUDEP. These factors fall into four categories: influences of (1) being unwitnessed, (2) lying prone in bed, (3) sleep-wake state, and (4) circadian rhythms. During the night, seizures are more likely to be unwitnessed; therefore, it is less likely that another person would be able to administer a lifesaving intervention. Patients are more likely to be prone on a bed following a nocturnal seizure. Being prone in the accouterments of a bed during the postictal period might impair breathing and increase SUDEP risk. Sleep typically happens at night and seizures which emerge from sleep might be more dangerous. Lastly, there are circadian changes to physiology during the night which might facilitate SUDEP. These possible explanations for the nocturnality of SUDEP are not mutually exclusive. The increased rate of SUDEP during the night is likely multifactorial involving both situational factors, such as being without a witness and prone, and physiological changes due to the influence of sleep and circadian rhythms. Understanding the causal elements in the nocturnality of SUDEP may be critical to the development of effective preventive countermeasures.",

abstract = "Introduction: Peri-ictal breathing dysfunction was proposed as a potential mechanism for SUDEP. We examined the incidence and risk factors for both ictal (ICA) and post-convulsive central apnea (PCCA) and their relationship with potential seizure severity biomarkers (i. e., post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) and recurrence. Methods: Prospective, multi-center seizure monitoring study of autonomic, and breathing biomarkers of SUDEP in adults with intractable epilepsy and monitored seizures. Video EEG, thoraco-abdominal excursions, capillary oxygen saturation, and electrocardiography were analyzed. A subgroup analysis determined the incidences of recurrent ICA and PCCA in patients with $\geq$2 recorded seizures. We excluded status epilepticus and obscured/unavailable video. Central apnea (absence of thoracic-abdominal breathing movements) was defined as $\geq$1 missed breath, and $\geq$5 s. ICA referred to apnea preceding or occurring along with non-convulsive seizures (NCS) or apnea before generalized convulsive seizures (GCS). Results: We analyzed 558 seizures in 218 patients (130 female); 321 seizures were NCS and 237 were GCS. ICA occurred in 180/487 (36.9\%) seizures in 83/192 (43.2\%) patients, all with focal epilepsy. Sleep state was related to presence of ICA [RR 1.33, CI 95\% (1.08-1.64), p = 0.008] whereas extratemporal epilepsy was related to lower incidence of ICA [RR 0.58, CI 95\% (0.37-0.90), p = 0.015]. ICA recurred in 45/60 (75\%) patients. PCCA occurred in 41/228 (18\%) of GCS in 30/134 (22.4\%) patients, regardless of epilepsy type. Female sex [RR 11.30, CI 95\% (4.50-28.34), p < 0.001] and ICA duration [RR 1.14 CI 95\% (1.05-1.25), p = 0.001] were related to PCCA presence, whereas absence of PGES was related to absence of PCCA [0.27, CI 95\% (0.16-0.47), p < 0.001]. PCCA duration was longer in males [HR 1.84, CI 95\% (1.06-3.19), p = 0.003]. In 9/17 (52.9\%) patients, PCCA was recurrent. Conclusion: ICA incidence is almost twice the incidence of PCCA and is only seen in focal epilepsies, as opposed to PCCA, suggesting different pathophysiologies. ICA is likely to be a recurrent semiological phenomenon of cortical seizure discharge, whereas PCCA may be a reflection of brainstem dysfunction after GCS. Prolonged ICA or PCCA may, respectively, contribute to SUDEP, as evidenced by two cases we report. Further prospective cohort studies are needed to validate these hypotheses.",

Most SUDEP cases occur in bed at night and are preceded by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS). Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe childhood-onset epilepsy commonly caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene. Affected individuals suffer from refractory seizures and an increased risk of SUDEP. Here, we demonstrate that mice with the Scn1aR1407X/+ loss-of-function mutation (DS) experience more spontaneous seizures and SUDEP during the early night. We also evaluate effects of long-term ketogenic diet (KD) treatment on mortality and seizure frequency. DS mice showed high premature mortality (44\% survival by P60) that was associated with increased spontaneous GTCSs 1-2 days prior to SUDEP. KD treated mice had a significant reduction in mortality (86\% survival by P60) compared to mice fed a control diet. Interestingly, increased survival was not associated with a decrease in seizure frequency. Further studies are needed to determine how KD confers protection from SUDEP. Moreover, our findings implicate time of day as a factor influencing the occurrence of seizures and SUDEP. DS mice, though nocturnal, are more likely to have SUDEP at night, suggesting that the increased incidence of SUDEP at night in may not be solely due to sleep.",

abstract = "In this narrative review, we summarize the current knowledge of neurally mediated blood pressure (BP) control and discuss how recently described epilepsy- and seizure-related BP alterations may contribute to premature mortality and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although people with epilepsy display disturbed interictal autonomic function with a shift toward predominant sympathetic activity, prevalence of arterial hypertension is similar in people with and without epilepsy. BP is transiently increased in association with most types of epileptic seizures but may also decrease in some, illustrating that seizure activity can cause both a decrease and increase of BP, probably because of stimulation or inhibition of distinct central autonomic function by epileptic activity that propagates into different neuronal networks of the central autonomic nervous system. The principal regulatory neural loop for short-term BP control is termed baroreflex, mainly involving peripheral sensors and brain stem nuclei. The baroreflex sensitivity (BRS, expressed as change of interbeat interval per change in BP) is intact after focal seizures, whereas BRS is markedly impaired in the early postictal period following generalized convulsive seizures (GCS), possibly due to metabolically mediated muscular hyperemia in skeletal muscles, a massive release of catecholamines and compromised brain stem function. Whilst most SUDEP cases are probably caused by a cardiorespiratory failure during the early postictal period following GCS, a profoundly disturbed BRS may allow a life-threatening drop of systemic BP in the aftermath of GCS, as recently reported in a patient as a plausible cause of SUDEP in a few patients.",

Based on detailed animal studies that are sometimes impossible in humans, and striking parallels with a growing body of clinical examples, this framework (1) accounts for the autonomic, cardiac, and respiratory data to date by showing the causal relationships between specific elements, and (2) highlights specific kinds of data that can be used to precisely classify various patient outcomes. The framework also justifies a ``near miss'' designation to be applied to any cases with evidence of obstructive apnea even, and perhaps especially, in individuals that do not require resuscitation.

Acute and adaptive changes in heart rhythm in epilepsy implicate cardiac dysfunction as a potential pathogenic mechanism in SUDEP. Furthermore, variants in genes associated with Long QT syndrome (LQTS) have been identified in patients with SUDEP. LQTS is a cardiac arrhythmia condition that causes sudden cardiac death with strong similarities to SUDEP. Here, we discuss the possibility of an additive risk of death due to the functional consequences of a pathogenic variant in an LQTS gene interacting with seizure-mediated changes in cardiac function. Extending this general concept, we propose a hypothesis that common variants in LQTS genes, which cause a subtle impact on channel function and would not normally be considered risk factors for cardiac disease, may increase the risk of sudden death when combined with epilepsy. A greater understanding of the interaction between epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia, and SUDEP will inform our understanding of SUDEP risk and subsequent potential prophylactic treatment.",

In temporal lobe epilepsy, there is volume loss in brainstem regions involved in autonomic control and increasing neuropathological changes with duration of epilepsy suggesting increasingly impaired regulation of ventilation. In animal models, recurrent hypoxic episodes induce long-term facilitation (LTF) of ventilatory function, however, LTF is less robust in older animals. LTF of ventilation may, to some degree, ameliorate the deleterious effects of progressive brainstem atrophy. We investigated the possibility that the duration of epilepsy, or age at epilepsy onset, may impact the severity of seizure-associated respiratory dysfunction. Patients with focal epilepsy undergoing video-EEG telemetry in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) were studied. We found a significant relationship between age at epilepsy onset and duration of peri-ictal oxygen desaturation for focal seizures not progressing to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, with longer duration of peri-ictal oxygen desaturation in patients with epilepsy onset at an older age but no significant relationships between duration of epilepsy or age at EMU admission and ventilatory dysfunction. Our findings suggest an intriguing possibility that LTF of ventilation may be protective when epilepsy starts at a younger age.",

author = "Lucchesi, Michael and Silverman, Joshua B and Sundaram, Krishnamurthi and Kollmar, Richard and Stewart, Mark",
abstract = "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in young adults with uncontrolled seizures. First aid guidance to prevent SUDEP, though, has not been previously published because the rarity of monitored cases has made the underlying mechanism difficult to define. This starkly contrasts with the first aid guidelines for sudden cardiac arrest that have been developed based on retrospective studies and expert consensus and the discussion of resuscitation challenges in various American Heart Association certificate courses. However, an increasing amount of evidence from documented SUDEP cases and near misses and from animal models points to a consistent sequence of events that starts with sudden airway occlusion and suggests a mechanistic basis for enhancing seizure first aid. In monitored cases, this sudden airway occlusion associated with seizure activity can be accurately inferred from inductance plethysmography or (depending on recording bandwidth) from electromyographic (EMG) bursts that are associated with inspiratory attempts appearing on the electroencephalogram (EEG) or the electrocardiogram (ECG). In an emergency setting or outside a hospital, seizure first aid can be improved by (1) keeping a lookout for sudden changes in airway status during a seizure, (2) distinguishing thoracic and abdominal movements during attempts to inspire from effective breathing, (3) applying a simple maneuver, the laryngospasm notch maneuver, that may help with airway management when aggressive airway management is unavailable, (4) providing oxygen early as a preventative step to reduce the risk of death, and (5) performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation before the limited post-ictal window of opportunity closes. We propose that these additions to first aid protocols can limit progression of any potential SUDEP case and prevent death. Risk stratification can be improved by recognition of airway occlusion, attendant hypoxia, and need for resuscitation.",

abstract = "Epilepsy has a high prevalence and can severely impair quality of life and increase the risk of premature death. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in drug-resistant epilepsy and most often results from respiratory and cardiac impairments due to brainstem dysfunction. Epileptic activity can spread widely, influencing neuronal activity in regions outside the epileptic network. The brainstem controls cardiorespiratory activity and arousal and reciprocally connects to cortical, diencephalic, and spinal cord areas. Epileptic activity can propagate trans-synaptically or via spreading depression (SD) to alter brainstem functions and cause cardiorespiratory dysfunction. The mechanisms by which seizures propagate to or otherwise impair brainstem function and trigger the cascading effects that cause SUDEP are poorly understood. We review insights from mouse models combined with new techniques to understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy and SUDEP. These techniques include in vivo, ex vivo, invasive and non-invasive methods in anesthetized and awake mice. Optogenetics combined with electrophysiological and optical manipulation and recording methods offer unique opportunities to study neuronal mechanisms under normal conditions, during and after non-fatal seizures, and in SUDEP. These combined approaches can advance our understanding of brainstem pathophysiology associated with seizures and SUDEP and may suggest strategies to prevent SUDEP.",

abstract = "Objectives: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a catastrophic epilepsy outcome for which there are no reliable premortem imaging biomarkers of risk. Percival respiratory depression is seen in monitored SUDEP and near SUDEP cases, and abnormal chemosensing of raised blood carbon dioxide (CO2) is thought to contribute. Damage to brainstem respiratory control and chemosensing structures has been demonstrated in structural imaging and neuropathological studies of SUDEP. We hypothesized that functional MRI (fMRI) correlates of abnormal chemosensing are detectable in brainstems of persons with epilepsy (PWE) and are different from healthy controls (HC). Methods: We analyzed fMRI BOLD activation and brain connectivity in 10 PWE and 10 age- and sex-matched HCs during precisely metered iso-oxic, hypercapnic breathing challenges. Segmented brainstem responses were of particular interest, along with characterization of functional connectivity metrics between these structures. Regional BOLD activations during hypercapnic challenges were convolved with hemodynamic responses, and the resulting activation maps were passed on to group-level analyses. For the functional connectivity analysis, significant clusters from BOLD results were used as seeds. Each individual seed time-series activation map was extracted for bivariate correlation coefficient analyses to study changes in brain connectivity between PWE and HCs. Results: (1) Greater brainstem BOLD activations in PWE were observed compared to HC during hypercapnic challenges in several structures with respiratory/chemosensing properties. Group comparison between PWE vs. HC showed significantly greater activation in the dorsal raphe among PWE (p < 0.05) compared to HCs. (2) PWE had significantly greater seed-seed connectivity and recruited more structures during hypercapnia compared to HC. Significance: The results of this study show that BOLD responses to hypercapnia in human brainstem are detectable and different in PWE compared to HC. Increased dorsal raphe BOLD activation in PWE and increased seed-seed connectivity between brainstem and adjacent subcortical areas may indicate abnormal chemosensing in these individuals. Imaging investigation of brainstem respiratory centers involved in respiratory regulation in PWE is an important step toward identifying suspected dysfunction of brainstem breathing control that culminates in SUDEP and deserve further study as potential imaging SUDEP biomarkers.",

SUDEP is generally considered to result from seizure-related cardiac dysfunction, respiratory depression, autonomic nervous dysfunction, or brain dysfunction. Frequency of generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS), prone posture, and refractory epilepsy are considered risk factors. SUDEP has also been associated with inherited cardiac ion channel disease and severe obstructive sleep apnea. Most previous studies of SUDEP mechanisms have focused on cardiac and respiratory dysfunction and imbalance of the neural regulatory system. Cardiac-related mechanisms include reduction in heart rate variability and prolongation of QT interval, which can lead to arrhythmias. Laryngospasm and amygdala activation may cause obstructive and central apnea, respectively. Neural mechanisms include impairment of 5-HT and adenosine neuromodulation. The research to date regarding molecular mechanisms of SUDEP is relatively limited. Most studies have focused on p-glycoprotein, catecholamines, potassium channels, and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which affect cardiac and respiratory function.",

abstract = "Despite technological and interpretative advances, the non-invasive modalities used for pre-surgical evaluation of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), fail to generate a concordant anatomo-electroclinical hypothesis for the location of the seizure onset zone in many patients. This requires chronic monitoring with intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), which facilitates better localization of the seizure onset zone, and allows evaluation of the functional significance of cortical regions-of-interest by electrical stimulation mapping (ESM). There are two principal modalities for intracranial EEG, namely subdural electrodes and stereotactic depth electrodes (stereo-EEG). Although ESM is considered the gold standard for functional mapping with subdural electrodes, there have been concerns about its utility with stereo-EEG. This is mainly because subdural electrodes allow contiguous sampling of the dorsolateral convexity of cerebral hemispheres, and permit delineation of the extent of eloquent functional areas on the cortical surface. Stereo-EEG, while having relatively sparse sampling on the cortical surface, offers the ability to access the depth of sulci, mesial and basal surfaces of cerebral hemispheres, and deep structures such as the insula, which are largely inaccessible to subdural electrodes. As stereo-EEG is increasingly the preferred modality for intracranial monitoring, we find it opportune to summarize the literature for ESM with stereo-EEG in this narrative review. Emerging evidence shows that ESM for defining functional neuroanatomy is feasible with stereo-EEG, but probably requires a different approach for interpretation and clinical decision making compared to ESM with subdural electrodes. We have also compared ESM with stereo-EEG and subdural electrodes, for current thresholds required to evoke desired functional responses vs. unwanted after-discharges. In this regard, there is preliminary evidence that ESM with stereo-EEG may be safer than ESM with subdural grids. Finally, we have highlighted important unanswered clinical and scientific questions for ESM with stereo-EEG in the hope to encourage future research and collaborative efforts.",

abstract = "Objective: Electrical stimulation (ES) potentially delineates epileptogenic cortex through induction of typical seizures. Although frequently employed, its value for epilepsy surgery remains controversial. Similarly, ES is used to identify symptomatogenic zones, but with greater success and a long-standing evidence base. Recent work points to new seizure symptoms such as ictal central apnea (ICA) that may enhance presurgical hypotheses. The aims of this review are 2-fold: to determine the value of ES-induced seizures (ESIS) in epilepsy surgery and to analyze current evidence on ICA as a new surrogate of symptomatogenic cortex.Methods: Three databases were searched for ESIS. Investigators independently selected studies according to pre-specified criteria. Studies reporting postoperative outcome in patients with ESIS were included in a meta-analysis. For ES-induced apnea, a thorough search was performed and reference list searching was employed.Results: Of 6,314 articles identified for ESIS, 25 were considered eligible to be reviewed in full text. Fourteen studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (1,069 patients); six studies were included in the meta-analysis (530 patients). The meta-analysis showed that favorable outcome is associated with ESIS prior to surgery (OR: 2.02; 95\% CI: 1.332--3.08). In addition, the overall estimation of the occurrence of favorable outcome among cases with ESIS is 68.13\% (95\% CI: 56.62--78.7). On the other hand, recent studies have shown that stimulation of exclusively mesial temporal lobe structures elicits central apnea and represents symptomatogenic anatomic substrates of ICA. This is in variance with traditional teaching that mesial temporal ES is non-symptomatogenic.Conclusions: ES is a tool highly likely to aid in the delineation of the epileptogenic zone, since ESIS is associated with favorable postoperative outcomes (Engel I). There is an urgent need for prospective evaluation of this technique, including effective stimulation parameters and surgical outcomes, that will provide knowledge base for practice. In addition, ES-induced apnea studies suggest that ICA, especially when it is the first or only clinical sign, is an important semiological feature in localizing the symptomatogenic zone to mesial temporal lobe structures, which must be considered in SEEG explorations where this is planned, and in surgical resection strategies.",

author = "Taugher, Rebecca J and Ghobbeh, Ali and Sowers, Levi P and Fan, Rong and Wemmie, John A",
abstract = "Mice display an unconditioned freezing response to TMT, a predator odor isolated from fox feces. Here we found that in addition to freezing, TMT caused mice to decrease breathing rate, perhaps because of the aversive smell. Consistent with this possibility, olfactory bulb lesions attenuated this effect of TMT, as well as freezing. Interestingly, butyric acid, another foul odor, also caused mice to reduce breathing rate. However, unlike TMT, butyric acid did not induce freezing. Thus, although these aversive odors may affect breathing, the unpleasant smell and suppression of breathing by themselves are insufficient to cause freezing. Because the acid-sensing ion channel-1A (ASIC1A) has been previously implicated in TMT-evoked freezing, we tested whether Asic1a disruption also altered breathing. We found that TMT reduced breathing rate in both Asic1a(+/+) and Asic1a(-/-) mice, suggesting that ASIC1A is not required for TMT to inhibit breathing and that the absence of TMT-evoked freezing in the Asic1a(-/-) mice is not due to an inability to detect TMT. These observations further indicate that ASIC1A must affect TMT freezing in another way. Because the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has been critically implicated in TMT-evoked freezing and robustly expresses ASIC1A, we tested whether ASIC1A in the BNST plays a role in TMT-evoked freezing. We disrupted ASIC1A in the BNST of Asic1a(loxP/loxP) mice by delivering Cre recombinase to the BNST with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. We found that disrupting ASIC1A in the BNST reduced TMT-evoked freezing relative to control mice in which a virus expressing eGFP was injected. To test whether ASIC1A in the BNST was sufficient to increase TMT-evoked freezing, we used another AAV vector to express ASIC1A in the BNST of Asic1a(-/-) mice. We found region-restricted expression of ASIC1A in the BNST increased TMT-elicited freezing. Together, these data suggest that the BNST is a key site of ASIC1A action in TMT-evoked freezing.",

abstract = "This manuscript considers the central but neglected role of the autonomic nervous system in the expression and control of seizures in epilepsy (small) and tics in Tourette Syndrome (TS). In epilepsy, consideration of autonomic involvement is typically confined to differential diagnoses (e.g., syncope), or in relation to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Investigation is more limited in Tourette Syndrome. The role of the autonomic nervous system in the generation and prevention of epileptic seizures is largely overlooked. Emotional stimuli such as anxiety and stress are potent causes of seizures and tic activity in epilepsy and TS, respectively. This manuscript will describe a possible neural mechanism by which afferent autonomic projections linked to cognition and behavior influence central thalamo-cortical regulation, which appears to be an important means for controlling both seizure and tic activity. It also summarizes the link between the integrity of the default mode network and autonomic regulation in patients with epilepsy as well as the link between impaired motor control and autonomic regulation in patients with TS. Two neurological conditions; epilepsy and TS were chosen, as seizures and tics represent parameters that can be easily measured to investigate influences of autonomic functions. The EDA biofeedback approach is anticipated to gain a strong position within the next generation of treatment for epilepsy, as a non-invasive technique with minimal side effects. This approach also takes advantage of the current practical opportunity to utilize growing digital health technology.",

CRF projections from neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) to the brainstem are of particular interest for their role in motivated behavior. To directly examine the anatomy and function of CRF neurons, we generated a BAC transgenic Crh-Cre rat in which bacterial Cre recombinase is expressed from the Crh promoter. Using Cre-dependent reporters, we found that Cre expressing neurons in these rats are immunoreactive for CRF and are clustered in the lateral CeA (CeL) and the oval nucleus of the BNST. We detected major projections from CeA CRF neurons to parabrachial nuclei and the locus coeruleus, dorsal and ventral BNST, and more minor projections to lateral portions of the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and lateral hypothalamus. Optogenetic stimulation of CeA CRF neurons evoked GABA-ergic responses in 11\% of non-CRF neurons in the medial CeA (CeM) and 44\% of non-CRF neurons in the CeL. Chemogenetic stimulation of CeA CRF neurons induced Fos in a similar proportion of non-CRF CeM neurons but a smaller proportion of non-CRF CeL neurons. The CRF1 receptor antagonist R121919 reduced this Fos induction by two-thirds in these regions. These results indicate that CeL CRF neurons provide both local inhibitory GABA and excitatory CRF signals to other CeA neurons, and demonstrate the value of the Crh-Cre rat as a tool for studying circuit function and physiology of CRF neurons.",

abstract = "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has evolved into a well-accepted add-on treatment for patients with severe Parkinsons disease as well as for other chronic neurological conditions. The focal action of electrical stimulation can yield better responses and it exposes the patient to fewer side effects compared to pharmaceuticals distributed throughout the body toward the brain. On the other hand, the current practice of DBS is hampered by the relatively coarse level of neuromodulation achieved. Optogenetics, in contrast, offers the perspective of much more selective actions on the various physiological structures, provided that the stimulated cells are rendered sensitive to the action of light. Optogenetics has experienced tremendous progress since its first in vivo applications about 10 years ago. Recent advancements of viral vector technology for gene transfer substantially reduce vector-associated cytotoxicity and immune responses. This brings about the possibility to transfer this technology into the clinic as a possible alternative to DBS and neuromodulation. New paths could be opened toward a rich panel of clinical applications. Some technical issues still limit the long term use in humans but realistic perspectives quickly emerge. Despite a rapid accumulation of observations about patho-physiological mechanisms, it is still mostly serendipity and empiric adjustments that dictate clinical practice while more efficient logically designed interventions remain rather exceptional. Interestingly, it is also very much the neuro technology developed around optogenetics that offers the most promising tools to fill in the existing knowledge gaps about brain function in health and disease.

abstract = "Parafacial zone (PZ) GABAergic neurons play a major role in slow-wave-sleep (SWS), also called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The PZ also contains glutamatergic neurons expressing the vesicular transporter for glutamate, isoform 2 (Vglut2). We hypothesized that PZ Vglut2-expressing (PZVglut2) neurons are also involved in sleep control, playing a synergistic role with PZ GABAergic neurons. To test this hypothesis, we specifically activated PZVglut2 neurons using the excitatory chemogenetic receptor hM3Dq. Anatomical inspection of the injection sites revealed hM3Dq transfection in PZ, parabrachial nucleus (PB), sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD) or various combinations of these three brain areas. Consistent with the known wake- and REM sleep-promoting role of PB and SLD, respectively, chemogenetic activation of PBVglut2 or SLDVglut2 resulted in wake or REM sleep enhancement. Chemogenetic activation of PZVglut2 neurons did not affect sleep-wake phenotype during the mouse active period but increased wakefulness and REM sleep, similar to PBVglut2 and SLDVglut2 activation, during the rest period. To definitively confirm the role of PZVglut2 neurons, we used a specific marker for PZVglut2 neurons, Phox2B. Chemogenetic activation of PZPhox2B neurons did not affect sleep-wake phenotype, indicating that PZ glutamatergic neurons are not sufficient to affect sleep-wake cycle.

Patients with SCN8A encephalopathy have an elevated risk for SUDEP. While transgenic mouse models have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms of SCN8A encephalopathy etiology, our understanding of seizure-induced death has been hampered by the inability to reliably trigger both seizures and seizure-induced death in these mice. Here, we demonstrate that mice harboring an Scn8a allele with the patient-derived mutation N1768D (D/+) are susceptible to audiogenic seizures and seizure-induced death. In adult D/+ mice, audiogenic seizures are non-fatal and have nearly identical behavioral, electrographical, and cardiorespiratory characteristics as spontaneous seizures. In contrast, at postnatal days 20-21, D/+ mice exhibit the same seizure behavior, but have a significantly higher incidence of seizure-induced death following an audiogenic seizure. Seizure-induced death was prevented by either stimulating breathing via mechanical ventilation or by acute activation of adrenergic receptors. Conversely, in adult D/+ mice inhibition of adrenergic receptors converted normally non-fatal audiogenic seizures into fatal seizures. Taken together, our studies show that in our novel audiogenic seizure-induced death model adrenergic receptor activation is necessary and sufficient for recovery of breathing and prevention of seizure-induced death.",

Despite there being dozens of preventative anti-seizure medications available, these drugs fail to control seizures in nearly 1 in 3 patients with epilepsy. Over the last century, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that internal and external rhythms can modify seizure phenotypes. Physiologically relevant rhythms with shorter periodic rhythms, such as endogenous circadian rhythms and sleep-state, as well as rhythms with longer periodicity, including multidien rhythms and menses, influence the timing of seizures through poorly understood mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to discuss the findings from both human and animal studies that consider the effect of such biologically relevant rhythms on epilepsy and seizure-associated death. Patients with medically refractory epilepsy are at increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The role that some of these rhythms play in the nocturnal susceptibility to SUDEP will also be discussed. While the involvement of some of these rhythms in epilepsy has been known for over a century, applying the rhythmic nature of such phenomenon to epilepsy management, particularly in mitigating the risk of SUDEP, has been underutilized. As our understanding of the physiological influence on such rhythmic phenomenon improves, and as technology for chronic intracranial epileptiform monitoring becomes more widespread, smaller and less invasive, novel seizure-prediction technologies and time-dependent chronotherapeutic seizure management strategies can be realized.",

abstract = "Chronic exposure to social defeat stress (SDS) has been used to investigate the neurobiology of depressive- and anxiety-like responses and mnemonic processes. We hypothesized that these affective, emotional, and cognitive consequences induced by SDS are regulated via glutamatergic neurons located in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), amygdaloid complex, and hippocampus in mice. Here, we investigated the influence of chronic SDS on (i) the avoidance behavior assessed in the social interaction test, (ii) the anxiety-like behavior (e.g., elevated plus-maze, and open field tests) (iii) depressive-like behaviors (e.g., coat state, sucrose splash, nesting building, and novel object exploration tests), (iv) the short-term memory (object recognition test), (v) $\Delta$FosB, CaMKII as well as $\Delta$FosB+CaMKII labeling in neurons located in the BNST, amygdaloid complex, dorsal (dHPC) and the ventral (vHPC) hippocampus. The main results showed that the exposure of mice to SDS (a) increased defensive and anxiety-like behaviors and led to memory impairment without eliciting clear depressive-like or anhedonic effects; (b) increased $\Delta$FosB+CaMKII labeling in BNST and amygdala, suggesting that both areas are strongly involved in the modulation of this type of stress; and produced opposite effects on neuronal activation in the vHPC and dHPC, i.e., increasing and decreasing, respectively, $\Delta$FosB labeling. The effects of SDS on the hippocampus suggest that the vHPC is likely related to the increase of defensive- and anxiety-related behaviors, whereas the dHPC seems to modulate the memory impairment. Present findings add to a growing body of evidence indicating the involvement of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the circuits that modulate emotional and cognitive consequences induced by social defeat stress.",

author = "Lasarge, Candi L and Danzer, Steve C",
abstract = "The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates a variety of neuronal functions, including cell proliferation, survival, growth, and plasticity. Dysregulation of the pathway is implicated in the development of both genetic and acquired epilepsies. Indeed, several causal mutations have been identified in patients with epilepsy, the most prominent of these being mutations in PTEN and tuberous sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 (TSC1, TSC2). These genes act as negative regulators of mTOR signaling, and mutations lead to hyperactivation of the pathway. Animal models deleting PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2 consistently produce epilepsy phenotypes, demonstrating that increased mTOR signaling can provoke neuronal hyperexcitability. Given the broad range of changes induced by altered mTOR signaling, however, the mechanisms underlying seizure development in these animals remain uncertain. In transgenic mice, cell populations with hyperactive mTOR have many structural abnormalities that support recurrent circuit formation, including somatic and dendritic hypertrophy, aberrant basal dendrites, and enlargement of axon tracts. At the functional level, mTOR hyperactivation is commonly, but not always, associated with enhanced synaptic transmission and plasticity. Moreover, these populations of abnormal neurons can affect the larger network, inducing secondary changes that may explain paradoxical findings reported between cell and network functioning in different models or at different developmental time points. Here, we review the animal literature examining the link between mTOR hyperactivation and epileptogenesis, emphasizing the impact of enhanced mTOR signaling on neuronal form and function.",

abstract = "General anesthesia has been used clinically for more than 170 years, yet its underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in the brainstem has been known to be crucial for regulating wakefulness and signs of arousal on the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG). Lesions of the parabrachial complex lead to unresponsiveness and a monotonous high-voltage, and a slow-wave EEG, which are the two main features of general anesthesia. However, it is unclear whether and how the PBN functions in the process of general anesthesia. By recording the levels of calcium in vivo in real-time, we found that the neural activity in PBN is suppressed during anesthesia, while it is robustly activated during recovery from propofol and isoflurane anesthesia. The activation of PBN neurons by ``designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs'' (DREADDs) shortened the recovery time but did not change the induction time. Cortical EEG recordings revealed that the neural activation of PBN specifically affected the recovery period, with a decrease of $\delta$-band power or an increase in $\beta$-band power; no EEG changes were seen in the anesthesia period. Furthermore, the activation of PBN elicited neural activation in the prefrontal cortex, basal forebrain, lateral hypothalamus, thalamus, and supramammillary nucleus. Thus, PBN is critical for behavioral and electroencephalographic arousal without affecting the induction of general anesthesia.",

However, unlike them THIP lacks abuse potential and induces conditioned place aversion in mice. The mechanism underlying the aversive effects of THIP remains elusive. Here, we show that mild aversive effects of THIP were detected 2 hours after administration likely reflecting an anxiety-like state with increased corticosterone release and with central recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor CRF1 receptors. A detailed immunohistochemical c-Fos expression mapping for THIP-activated brain areas revealed a correlation between the activation of CRF-expressing neurons in the oval nucleus of the bed nuclei of stria terminalis and THIP-induced aversive effects. In addition, the neuroplasticity of mesolimbic DA system (24 hours after administration) and conditioned place aversion by THIP after 4 daily acute sessions were dependent on extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (abolished in delta-GABAA receptor knockout mice) and activation of the CRF1 receptors (abolished in wildtype mice by a CRF1 receptor antagonist). A selective THIP-induced activation of CRF-expressing neurons in the oval part of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis may constitute a novel mechanism for inducing plasticity in a population of VTA DA neurons and aversive behavioral states.",

author = "Scharfman, Helen E and Bernstein, Hannah L",
abstract = "The dentate gyrus (DG) is important to many aspects of hippocampal function, but there are many aspects of the DG that are incompletely understood. One example is the role of mossy cells (MCs), a major DG cell type that is glutamatergic and innervates the primary output cells of the DG, the granule cells (GCs). MCs innervate the GCs as well as local circuit neurons that make GABAergic synapses on GCs, so the net effect of MCs on GCs - and therefore the output of the DG - is unclear. Here we first review fundamental information about MCs and the current hypotheses for their role in the normal DG and in diseases that involve the DG. Then we review previously published data which suggest that MCs are a source of input to a subset of GCs that are born in adulthood (adult-born GCs). In addition, we discuss the evidence that adult-born GCs may support the normal inhibitory 'gate' functions of the DG, where the GCs are a filter or gate for information from the entorhinal cortical input to area CA3. The implications are then discussed in the context of seizures and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In TLE, it has been suggested that the DG inhibitory gate is weak or broken and MC loss leads to insufficient activation of inhibitory neurons, causing hyperexcitability. That idea was called the ``dormant basket cell hypothesis.'' Recent data suggest that loss of normal adult-born GCs may also cause disinhibition, and seizure susceptibility. Therefore, we propose a reconsideration of the dormant basket cell hypothesis with an intervening adult-born GC between the MC and basket cell and call this hypothesis the ``dormant immature granule cell hypothesis.''",

abstract = "5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors (5-HT2A-Rs) are G-protein coupled receptors. In agreement with their location in the brain, they have been implicated not only in various central physiological functions including memory, sleep, nociception, eating and reward behaviors, but also in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Interestingly, a bidirectional link between depression and epilepsy is suspected since patients with depression and especially suicide attempters have an increased seizure risk, while a significant percentage of epileptic patients suffer from depression. Such epidemiological data led us to hypothesize that both pathologies may share common anatomical and neurobiological alteration of the 5-HT2A signaling. After a brief presentation of the pharmacological properties of the 5-HT2A-Rs, this review illustrates how these receptors may directly or indirectly control neuronal excitability in most networks involved in depression and epilepsy through interactions with the monoaminergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions. It also synthetizes the preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrating the role of these receptors in antidepressant and antiepileptic responses.",

abstract = "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a refractory epilepsy typically caused by heterozygous mutations of the Scn1a gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes, have recently become attractive treatment modalities for patients with nervous system disease; however, the impact of GLP-1 analogues on DS remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the neuroprotective role of liraglutide in mouse and cell models of Scn1a KO-induced epilepsy. Epileptic susceptibility, behavioral changes, and behavioral seizures were assessed using electroencephalography (EEG), IntelliCage (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany), and the open field task. Morphological changes in brain tissues were observed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Nissl staining. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway were determined using immunofluorescence and western blotting in Scn1a KO-induced epileptic mice in vitro. Scn1a KO model cell proliferation was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and the effect of liraglutide on cellular apoptosis levels was examined using Annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry. Apoptotic signal proteins and mTOR were assessed using reverse transcription - quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. Our results showed that liraglutide significantly increased mRNA ((0.31 $\pm$ 0.04) *10-3 vs. (1.07 $\pm$ 0.08) * 10-3, P = 0.0004) and protein (0.10 $\pm$ 0.02 vs. 0.27 $\pm$ 0.02, P = 0.0006) expression of Scn1a in Scn1a KO-induced epileptic mice. In addition, liraglutide significantly alleviated electroencephalographic seizures, the severity of responses to epileptic seizures (96.53 $\pm$ 0.45 \% vs. 85.98 $\pm$ 1.24 \%, P = 0.0003), cognitive dysfunction, and epileptic-related necrotic neurons (9.76 $\pm$ 0.91 \% vs. 19.65 $\pm$ 2.64 \%, P = 0.0005) in Scn1a KO-induced epileptic mice. Moreover, liraglutide protected against Scn1a KO-induced apoptosis, which was manifested in the phosphorylation of mTOR (KO+NS: 1.99 $\pm$ 0.31 vs. KO+Lira: 0.97 $\pm$ 0.18, P = 0.0004), as well as the downregulation of cleaved caspase-3 (KO+NS: 0.49 $\pm$ 0.04 vs. KO+Lira: 0.30 $\pm$ 0.01, P = 0.0003) and restoration of the imbalance between BAX (KO+NS: 0.90 $\pm$ 0.02 vs. KO+Lira: 0.75 $\pm$ 0.04, P = 0.0005) and BCL-2 (KO+NS: 0.46 $\pm$ 0.02 vs. KO+Lira: 0.61 $\pm$ 0.02, P = 0.0006). Collectively, these results show that liraglutide reduces seizure susceptibility and cognitive dysfunction in the mouse model of Dravet syndrome, and exerts anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects in Scn1a KO mice and cells.",

abstract = "The mammalian diving response is a powerful autonomic adjustment to underwater submersion greatly affecting heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and ventilation. The bradycardia is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system, arterial blood pressure is mediated via the sympathetic system and still other circuits mediate the respiratory changes. In the present study we investigate the cardiorespiratory responses and the brainstem neurons activated by voluntary diving of trained rats, and, compare them to control and swimming animals which did not dive. We show that the bradycardia and increase in arterial blood pressure induced by diving were significantly different than that induced by swimming. Neuronal activation was calculated after immunohistochemical processing of brainstem sections for Fos protein. Labeled neurons were counted in the caudal pressor area, the medullary dorsal horn, subnuclei of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), the nucleus raphe pallidus (RPa), the rostroventrolateral medulla, the A5 area, the nucleus locus coeruleus, the K{\"o}lliker-Fuse area, and the external lateral and superior lateral subnuclei of the parabrachial nucleus. All these areas showed significant increases in Fos labeling when data from voluntary diving rats were compared to control rats and all but the commissural subnucleus of the NTS, A5 area, and RPa were significantly different from swimming rats. These data provide a substrate for more precise experiments to determine the role of these nuclei in the reflex circuits driving the diving response.",

abstract = "It is well known that breathing introduces rhythmical oscillations in the heart rate and arterial pressure levels. Sympathetic oscillations coupled to the respiratory activity have been suggested as an important homeostatic mechanism optimizing tissue perfusion and blood gas uptake/delivery. This respiratory-sympathetic coupling is strengthened in conditions of blood gas challenges (hypoxia and hypercapnia) as a result of the synchronized activation of brainstem respiratory and sympathetic neurons, culminating with the emergence of entrained cardiovascular and respiratory reflex responses. Studies have proposed that the ventrolateral region of the medulla oblongata is a major site of synaptic interaction between respiratory and sympathetic neurons. However, other brainstem regions also play a relevant role in the patterning of respiratory and sympathetic motor outputs. Recent findings suggest that the neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), in the dorsal medulla, are essential for the processing and coordination of respiratory and sympathetic responses to hypoxia. The NTS is the first synaptic station of the cardiorespiratory afferent inputs, including peripheral chemoreceptors, baroreceptors and pulmonary stretch receptors. The synaptic profile of the NTS neurons receiving the excitatory drive from afferent inputs is complex and involves distinct neurotransmitters, including glutamate, ATP and acetylcholine. In the present review we discuss the role of the NTS circuitry in coordinating sympathetic and respiratory reflex responses. We also analyze the neuroplasticity of NTS neurons and their contribution for the development of cardiorespiratory dysfunctions, as observed in neurogenic hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea and metabolic disorders.",

To test the hypothesis that this core circuit is embedded within an anatomically distributed pattern-generating network, we investigated whether local disinhibition of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), the K{\"o}lliker-Fuse nuclei (KFn), or the midbrain periaqueductal gray area (PAG) can similarly affect the respiratory pattern compared to disinhibition of the pre-B{\"o}tC/B{\"o}tC core. In arterially-perfused brainstem preparations of rats, we recorded the three-phase respiratory pattern (inspiration, post-inspiration and late-expiration) from phrenic and vagal nerves before and after bilateral microinjections of the GABA(A)R antagonist bicuculline (50 nl, 10 mM). Local disinhibition of either NTS, pre-B{\"o}tC/B{\"o}tC, or KFn, but not PAG, triggered qualitatively similar disruptions of the respiratory pattern resulting in a highly significant increase in the variability of the respiratory cycle length, including inspiratory and expiratory phase durations. To quantitatively analyze these motor pattern perturbations, we measured the strength of phase synchronization between phrenic and vagal motor outputs. This analysis showed that local disinhibition of all brainstem target nuclei, but not the midbrain PAG, significantly decreased the strength of phase synchronization. The convergent perturbations of the respiratory pattern suggest that the rCPG expands rostrally and dorsally from the designated core but does not include higher mid-brain structures. Our data also suggest that excitation-inhibition balance of respiratory network synaptic interactions critically determines the network dynamics that underlie vital respiratory rhythm and pattern formation.",

abstract = "It is supposed that the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the dorsal medulla includes gas sensor cells responsive to hypercapnia or hypoxia in the central nervous system. In the present study, we analyzed cellular responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia in the NTS region of newborn rat in vitro preparation. The brainstem and spinal cord were isolated from newborn rat (P0-P4) and were transversely cut at the level of the rostral area postrema. To detect cellular responses, calcium indicator Oregon Green was pressure-injected into the NTS just beneath the cut surface of either the caudal or rostral block of the medulla, and the preparation was superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (25-26°C). We examined cellular responses initially to hypercapnic stimulation (to 8\% CO2 from 2\% CO2) and then to hypoxic stimulation (to 0\% O2 from 95\% O2 at 5\% CO2). We tested these responses in standard solution and in two different synapse blockade solutions: (1) cocktail blockers solution including bicuculline, strychnine, NBQX and MK-801 or (2) TTX solution. At the end of the experiments, the superfusate potassium concentration was lowered to 0.2 from 3 mM to classify recorded cells into neurons and astrocytes. Excitation of cells was detected as changes of fluorescence intensity with a confocal calcium imaging system. In the synaptic blockade solutions (cocktail or TTX solution), 7.6 and 8\% of the NTS cells responded to hypercapnic and hypoxic stimulation, respectively, and approximately 2\% of them responded to both stimulations. Some of these cells responded to low K+, and they were classified into astrocytes comprising 43\% hypercapnia-sensitive cells, 56\% hypoxia-sensitive cells and 54\% of both stimulation-sensitive cells. Of note, 49\% of the putative astrocytes identified by low K+ stimulation were sensitive to hypercapnia, hypoxia or both. In the presence of a glia preferential blocker, 5 mM fluoroacetate (plus 0.5 $\mu$M TTX), the percentage of hypoxia-sensitive cells was significantly reduced compared to those of all other conditions. This is the first study to reveal that the NTS includes hypercapnia and hypoxia dual-sensitive cells. These results suggest that astrocytes in the NTS region could act as a central gas sensor.",

abstract = "Introduction: The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of psychotherapy are scarcely understood. In particular, the modifying effects of psychotherapy on neuronal activity are largely unknown. We here present data from an innovative experimental paradigm using the example of a patient with treatment resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (trOCD) who underwent implantation of bilateral electrodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS). The aim of the paradigm was to examine the short term effect of metacognitive therapy (MCT) on neuronal local field potentials (LFP) before and after 5 MCT sessions. Methods: DBS electrodes were implanted bilaterally with stereotactic guidance in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis/ internal capsule (BNST/IC). The period between implantation of the electrodes and the pacemaker was used for the experimental paradigm. DBS electrodes were externalized via extension cables, yielding the opportunity to record LFP directly from the BNST/IC. The experimental paradigm was designed as follows: (a) baseline recording of LFP from the BNST/IC, (b) application of 5 MCT sessions over 3 days, (c) post-MCT recording from the BNST/IC. The Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder- scale (OCD-S) was used to evaluate OCD symptoms. Results: OCD symptoms decreased after MCT. These reductions were accompanied by a decrease of the relative power of theta band activity, while alpha, beta, and gamma band activity was significantly increased after MCT. Further, analysis of BNST/IC LFP and frontal cortex EEG coherence showed that MCT decreased theta frequency band synchronization. Discussion: Implantation of DBS electrodes for treating psychiatric disorders offers the opportunity to gather data from neuronal circuits, and to compare effects of therapeutic interventions. Here, we demonstrate direct effects of MCT on neuronal oscillatory behavior, which may give possible cues for the neurobiological changes associated with psychotherapy.",

It is not known whether mossy fiber sprouting increases the number of synapses in the molecular layer or merely replaces lost contacts. Using the pilocarpine (Pilo) model of status epilepticus to induce mossy fiber sprouting, and cycloheximide (CHX) to block this sprouting, we evaluated at the ultrastructural level the number and type of asymmetric synaptic contacts in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. As expected, whereas Pilo-treated rats had dense silver grain deposits in the inner molecular layer (IML) (reflecting mossy fiber sprouting), pilocarpine + cycloheximide (CHX + Pilo)-treated animals did not differ from controls. Both groups of treated rats (Pilo group and CHX + Pilo group) had reduced density of asymmetric synaptic profiles (putative excitatory synaptic contacts), which was greater for CHX-treated animals. For both treated groups, the loss of excitatory synaptic contacts was even greater in the outer molecular layer than in the best-studied IML (in which mossy fiber sprouting occurs). These results indicate that mossy fiber sprouting tends to replace lost synaptic contacts rather than increase the absolute number of contacts. We speculate that the overall result is more consistent with restored rather than with increased excitability.",

Converging research indicates that the amygdala and BNST play complementary but distinct functional roles during threat processing, with the BNST specializing in the detection of a potential threat to maintain hypervigilance and anxiety, while the amygdala responds to the perceived presence of an aversive stimulus (i.e., fear). Therefore, given that human anxiety is largely driven by future-oriented hypothetical threats that may never occur, studies involving the BNST stand at the forefront of essential future research with the potential to bring about profound insights for understanding and treating anxiety disorders. In this article, we present a narrative review on the BNST, summarizing its roles in anxiety and the stress response and highlighting the most recent advances in the clinical realm. Furthermore, we discuss oversights in the current state of anxiety research and identify avenues for future exploration.",

author = "Koe, Amelia S and Jones, Nigel C and Salzberg, Michael R",
abstract = "The pathogenesis of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the most prevalent form of refractory focal epilepsy in adults, is thought to begin in early life, even though seizures may not commence until adolescence or adulthood. Amongst the range of early life factors implicated in MTLE causation (febrile seizures, traumatic brain injury, etc.), stress may be one important contributor. Early life stress is an a priori agent deserving study because of the large amount of neuroscientific data showing enduring effects on structure and function in hippocampus and amygdala, the key structures involved in MTLE. An emerging body of evidence directly tests hypotheses concerning early life stress and limbic epilepsy: early life stressors, such as maternal separation, have been shown to aggravate epileptogenesis in both status epilepticus and kindling models of limbic epilepsy. In addition to elucidating its influence on limbic epileptogenesis itself, the study of early life stress has the potential to shed light on the psychiatric disorder that accompanies MTLE. For many years, psychiatric comorbidity was viewed as an effect of epilepsy, mediated psychologically and/or neurobiologically. An alternative - or complementary - perspective is that of shared causation. Early life stress, implicated in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders, may be one such causal factor. This paper aims to critically review the body of experimental evidence linking early life stress and epilepsy; to discuss the direct studies examining early life stress effects in current models of limbic seizures/epilepsy; and to suggest priorities for future research.",

Twenty-nine interictal-ictal Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were obtained from nine DRFE patients. A methodology for the relative quantification of cerebral blood flow of 74 cortical and sub-cortical structures was employed. The optimal number of clusters (K) was estimated using a modified v-fold cross-validation for the use of K means algorithm. The two regions of interest (ROIs) that represent the hypoperfused and hyperperfused areas were identified. To select the structures related to the SUDEP-7 inventory score, a data mining method that computes an automatic feature selection was used. During the interictal and ictal state, the hyperperfused ROIs in the largest part of patients were the bilateral rectus gyrus, putamen as well as globus pallidus ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone. The hypoperfused ROIs included the red nucleus, substantia nigra, medulla, and entorhinal area. The findings indicated that the nearly invariability in the perfusion pattern during the interictal to ictal transition observed in the ipsi-lateral putamen F = 12.60, p = 0.03, entorhinal area F = 25.80, p = 0.01, and temporal middle gyrus F = 12.60, p = 0.03 is a potential biomarker of SUDEP risk. The results presented in this paper allowed identifying hypo- and hyperperfused brain regions during the ictal and interictal state potentially related to SUDEP risk stratification.",

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, also known as SUDEP, is the main cause of death in patients with epilepsy. SUDEP has an incidence of 1.2 per 1000 person-years in adults and 0.2 per 1000 person-years in children. SUDEP accounts for 8-17\% of deaths in patients with epilepsy. It is commonly associated with a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and its risk may be increased by other factors such as postictal electroencephalographic suppression, prone sleeping position, altered heart rate variability, conduction abnormalities, gender, or antiepileptic medications. Recently, electrocardiograms, electroencephalograms, and imaging markers have helped clinicians stratify SUDEP risk and identify patients in need of close monitoring. However, the pathophysiology of SUDEP is likely multifactorial and still unknown. Improving the knowledge of SUDEP incidence, risk factors, and biomarkers can help design and implement effective prevention strategies.",

Epilepsy and neuroplasticity seem to be closely related, as the two processes could positively affect one another.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Central sensitization plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of chronic pain induced by chronic pancreatitis (CP). We hypothesized that the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), a primary central site that integrates pancreatic afferents apart from the thoracic spinal dorsal horn, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of visceral hypersensitivity in a rat model of CP. AIM: To investigate the role of the NTS in the visceral hypersensitivity induced by chronic pancreatitis. METHODS: CP was induced by the intraductal injection of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in rats. Pancreatic hyperalgesia was assessed by referred somatic pain via von Frey filament assay. Neural activation of the NTS was indicated by immunohistochemical staining for Fos. Basic synaptic transmission within the NTS was assessed by electrophysiological recordings. Expression of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluTs), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B), and $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subtype 1 (GluR1) was analyzed by immunoblotting. Membrane insertion of NR2B and GluR1 was evaluated by electron microscopy. The regulatory role of the NTS in visceral hypersensitivity was detected via pharmacological approach and chemogenetics in CP rats. RESULTS: TNBS treatment significantly increased the number of Fos-expressing neurons within the caudal NTS. The excitatory synaptic transmission was substantially potentiated within the caudal NTS in CP rats (frequency: 5.87 $\pm$ 1.12 Hz in CP rats vs 2.55 $\pm$ 0.44 Hz in sham rats, P < 0.01; amplitude: 19.60 $\pm$ 1.39 pA in CP rats vs 14.71 $\pm$ 1.07 pA in sham rats; P < 0.01). CP rats showed upregulated expression of VGluT2, and increased phosphorylation and postsynaptic trafficking of NR2B and GluR1 within the caudal NTS. Blocking excitatory synaptic transmission via the AMPAR antagonist CNQX and the NMDAR antagonist AP-5 microinjection reversed visceral hypersensitivity in CP rats (abdominal withdraw threshold: 7.00 $\pm$ 1.02 g in CNQX group, 8.00 $\pm$ 0.81 g in AP-5 group and 1.10 $\pm$ 0.27 g in saline group, P < 0.001). Inhibiting the excitability of NTS neurons via chemogenetics also significantly attenuated pancreatic hyperalgesia (abdominal withdraw threshold: 13.67 $\pm$ 2.55 g in Gi group, 2.00 $\pm$ 1.37 g in Gq group, and 2.36 $\pm$ 0.67 g in mCherry group, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that enhanced excitatory transmission within the caudal NTS contributes to pancreatic pain and emphasize the NTS as a pivotal hub for the processing of pancreatic afferents, which provide novel insights into the central sensitization of painful CP.",

abstract = "In epilepsy, seizures can evoke cardiac rhythm disturbances such as heart rate changes, conduction blocks, asystoles, and arrhythmias, which can potentially increase risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) are widely used clinical diagnostic tools to monitor for abnormal brain and cardiac rhythms in patients. Here, a technique to simultaneously record video, EEG, and ECG in mice to measure behavior, brain, and cardiac activities, respectively, is described. The technique described herein utilizes a tethered (i.e., wired) recording configuration in which the implanted electrode on the head of the mouse is hard-wired to the recording equipment. Compared to wireless telemetry recording systems, the tethered arrangement possesses several technical advantages such as a greater possible number of channels for recording EEG or other biopotentials; lower electrode costs; and greater frequency bandwidth (i.e., sampling rate) of recordings. The basics of this technique can also be easily modified to accommodate recording other biosignals, such as electromyography (EMG) or plethysmography for assessment of muscle and respiratory activity, respectively. In addition to describing how to perform the EEG-ECG recordings, we also detail methods to quantify the resulting data for seizures, EEG spectral power, cardiac function, and heart rate variability, which we demonstrate in an example experiment using a mouse with epilepsy due to Kcna1 gene deletion. Video-EEG-ECG monitoring in mouse models of epilepsy or other neurological disease provides a powerful tool to identify dysfunction at the level of the brain, heart, or brain-heart interactions.",

abstract = "In recent years, optogenetics has been widely used in many fields of neuroscientific research. In many cases, an opsin, such as channel rhodopsin 2 (ChR2), is expressed by a virus vector in a particular type of neuronal cells in various Cre-driver mice. Activation of these opsins is triggered by application of light pulses which are delivered by laser or LED through optic cables, and the effect of activation is observed with very high time resolution. Experimenters are able to acutely stimulate neurons while monitoring behavior or another physiological outcome in mice. Optogenetics can enable useful strategies to evaluate function of neuronal circuits in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states in mice. Here we describe a technique for examining the effect of optogenetic manipulation of neurons with a specific chemical identity during electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) monitoring to evaluate the sleep stage of mice. As an example, we describe manipulation of GABAergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Acute optogenetic excitation of these neurons triggers a rapid transition to wakefulness when applied during NREM sleep. Optogenetic manipulation along with EEG/EMG recording can be applied to decipher the neuronal circuits that regulate sleep/wakefulness states.",

abstract = "We investigated the effect of Rosa damascena Mill, essential oil on the development of induced amygdala kindling seizures. Male Wistar rats were implanted with one tripolar and two monopolar electrodes in right basolateral amygdala and dura surface, respectively. The control group was injected solvent of essential oil and two experimental groups were injected 750 and 1000 mg kg(-1) of essential oil (ip), 30 min before a daily kindling stimulation. The number of stimulations required for the first appearance of seizure stages was significantly larger in two experimental groups than in control group. Mean after discharge duration was significantly different and essential oil reduced the increase of after discharge duration. Mean after discharge amplitude was also shorter in the groups treated with essential oil than in control group. Duration time for 5th stage of seizure at fully-kindled rats was significantly shorter in two experimental groups than control group. These results suggest that Rosa damascena essential oil significantly retarded the development of seizure stages and possesses the ability to counteract kindling acquisition. The flavonoids of Rosa damascena may act via GABAA receptors as previous studies have proposed for flavonoids of other medicinal plants. More detailed studies are recommended to define the effective component(s) of Rosa on different types of epilepsy.",

Although there is no clear pathophysiological pathway for the manifestation of anxiety in epilepsy patients, there are many theories proposed by researchers that include neurological and psychological pathways. Based on this knowledge, pharmacological treatments are constantly being discovered to help patients with their disorder. Nonpharmacological treatments (such as psychotherapy) are strongly encouraged as first-line treatment, more so than reliance on medication due to the high possibility of adverse effects associated with the latter. Nevertheless, comprehensive diagnosis of the disorder is needed prior to treatment in order to avoid false negatives or positives.

These channels play a critical role towards neuronal firing in both conducting calcium ions during action potentials and also in switching neurons between distinct modes of firing. In this review the properties of the CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 T-type channel isoforms is discussed in relation to their individual contributions to action potentials during burst and tonic firing states as well their roles in switching between firing states.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The hallmark of anxiety disorders is excessive fear. Previous studies have suggested that selective neural projections from Basal nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) to amygdala and vice-versa precisely control the fear learning process. However the exact mechanism how the BNST controls fear consolidation and its extinction is largely unknown. In the present study we observed the changes in the BNST sub-regions following fear conditioning and its extinction. METHODS: The change in the number of positive neurons was determined by immunohistochemistry for Acetyl H3 (Histone 3), Acetyl H4 (Histone 4), cAMP response element binding Protein (CBP) and c-fos in three sub-regions of the BNST namely the anterio-lateral BNST (STLP) and anterio-medial BNST (STMA), and lateral-ventral BNST (STLV) of rats subjected to auditory fear conditioning and extinction. RESULTS: We found significant increase in the number of CBP, acetyl H3 and acetyl H4 positive neurons in the STMA and STLV but not in the STLP after fear conditioning. However, following fear extinction the number of CBP, acetyl H3 and acetyl H4 positive neurons increased significantly in the STLP but not in the STMA and STLV. Similar changes were observed in the number of c-fos positive neurons after fear consolidation and extinction. CONCLUSION: The results from this study suggest that the differential histone acetylation in the different sub-regions of the BNST following fear learning and its extinction may be responsible for changes in the neuronal activation patterns resulting in either fear or less fear.",

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Sudden unexpected deaths comprise the most important and worthy investigation case profiles in both neurology and forensic medicine. Epilepsy, which is one of the neuropathological causes of sudden unexpected deaths, is an important disorder having mysterious aspects. The aim of this study is to make common the points of view between neurology and forensic medicine experts and to discuss the features of the findings together with the related clinical hypotheses, leading to the differential diagnosis of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) by presenting autopsy findings and available medical data of patients who had a prior diagnosis of epilepsy. METHODS: In Istanbul, the cases of 20334 autopsied patients who were referred to The Ministry of Justice Council of Forensic Medicine between 2007 and 2011 were identified from the complete forensic autopsy data of the city and were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had a prior diagnosis of epilepsy were included. Both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed through the parameters of demographical data, physical properties, incident features, macroscopic-microscopic autopsy findings, and cause of death initially for all cases and then separately for SUDEP cases. RESULTS: Among the 20334 patients, 112 were determined to have a prior diagnosis of epilepsy. A possible macroscopic and/or microscopic epileptic focus was present in 23 (20.5\%) of these 112 cases. The cause of death was determined to be SUDEP in 40 (35.7\%) cases, while it could not be determined in 28 (25\%) cases. Among patients whose death cause was considered as SUDEP, the male-to-female ratio was 1.1:1, while the mean age was 31.5$\pm$13.9 years in males and 29.6$\pm$12.9 years in females. The presence of hypertrophy and myocardial scar tissue findings in the microscopic examination were significantly more frequent among patients determined to have died from cardiovascular diseases compared to patients in the SUDEP group (p=0.001 for each finding). Besides, in 40 SUDEP cases, 38 (95\%) patients underwent toxicological analysis and no antiepileptic agent was detected in 21 (55.3\%) of these. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that there is equality in gender distribution among SUDEP patients, that the young adult population has a slightly increased risk for SUDEP, and that the inconsistent use of antiepileptic medicines is a greater risk factor for SUDEP than polytherapy. Besides, it is important to emphasize that all clinical and postmortem parameters together should be considered for the differential diagnosis of SUDEP, particularly with cardiovascular diseases.",

abstract = "Intermittent vagus nerve stimulation can reduce the frequency of seizures in patients with refractory epilepsy. Stimulation of vagus nerve afferent fibers can also cause vocal cord dysfunction, laryngeal spasm, cough, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. Vagus nerve stimulation causes an increase in respiratory rate, decrease in respiratory amplitude, decrease in tidal volume, and decrease in oxygen saturation during periods of device activation. It usually does not cause an arousal, or a change in heart rate or blood pressure. Most patients have an increase in their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Patients with VNS can have central apneas, obstructive hypopneas, and obstructive apneas. These respiratory events can be reduced with changes in the vagus nerve stimulator operational parameters or with the use of CPAP. In summary, there are complex relationships between epilepsy and obstructive sleep apneas. In particular, patients with refractory epilepsy need assessment for undiagnosed and untreated obstructive sleep apnea before implantation of vagus nerve stimulator devices. Patients with vagus nerve stimulators often have an increase in apneic events after implantation, and these patients need screening for sleep apnea both before and after implantation.",

Inflammatory mediators, which are known triggers of fever, have also been implicated as contributors to the onset of these seizures. Evidence that inflammation is present following FS and during established epilepsy suggests that it could also influence epileptogenesis. However, the potential involvement of inflammatory mediators to the epileptogenic process that may follow prolonged FS has yet to be fully determined. This article reviews the current state of our knowledge and major gaps that remain by focusing on four questions: Does inflammation contribute to the generation of FS? Does prolonged FS or febrile status epilepticus (SE) cause temporal lobe epilepsy in the absence of predisposing factors? Does inflammation contribute to the process by which febrile SE causes limbic epilepsy? And finally, can inflammation be a foundation for biomarkers and therapy for FS-induced epileptogenesis?",

Possible prevention strategies for SUDEP include improved medication adherence, surgical interventions, nighttime safety, seizure detection devices, and diet. Pediatric providers have a great opportunity to educate families about SUDEP, assess medication adherence, and provide families with tools to improve medication adherence and learn about SUDEP in children and adolescents with epilepsy. Future research in SUDEP aims to further understand the etiology and risk factors of SUDEP, while developing more intervention strategies to prevent SUDEP.",

We measured brain oxygenation in localized areas from freely-moving rodents and discovered a severe hypoxic event (pO2 < 10 mmHg) after the termination of seizures. This event lasted over an hour, is mediated by hypoperfusion, generalizes to people with epilepsy, and is attenuated by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 or L-type calcium channels. Using inhibitors of these targets we separated the seizure from the resulting severe hypoxia and show that structure specific postictal memory and behavioral impairments are the consequence of this severe hypoperfusion/hypoxic event. Thus, epilepsy is much more than a disease hallmarked by seizures, since the occurrence of postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia results in a separate set of neurological consequences that are currently not being treated and are preventable.",

At the cellular level in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), we found inhibitory neurons expressing the Scn1a A1783V variant are less excitable, whereas glutamatergic chemosensitive RTN neurons, which are a key source of the CO2/H+-dependent drive to breathe, are hyper-excitable in slices from Scn1a$\Delta$E26 mice.

Additionally, backward (but not forward) CSs selectively increased Fos in the ventral BNST and in BNST-projecting neurons in the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but not in the hippocampus or amygdala.

Exposure to predator odor during protracted withdrawal from intermittent alcohol drinking resulted in enhanced prefrontal cortex (PFC)-driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the BNST. Furthermore, deletion of prodynorphin in the BNST and chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC-BNST pathway restored abnormal responses to predator odor in alcohol-exposed mice. These findings suggest that increased corticolimbic drive may promote abnormal stress behavioral responses to predator odor during protracted withdrawal. Various nodes of this PFC-BNST dynorphin-related circuit may serve as potential targets for potential therapeutic mediation as well as biomarkers of negative responses to stress following heavy alcohol drinking.",

In the present study we identify neurons projecting to the POA from PBN expressing the opioid peptides dynorphin and enkephalin. Using mouse models, we determine that warm-activated PBN neuronal populations overlap with both prodynorphin (Pdyn) and proenkephalin (Penk) expressing PBN populations.

Convergent data suggest hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) pathology in DS (Scn1a+/-) mice. We performed two-photon calcium imaging in brain slice to uncover a profound dysfunction of filtering of perforant path input by DG in young adult Scn1a+/- mice. This was not due to dysfunction of DG parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons (PV-INs), which were only mildly impaired at this timepoint; however, we identified enhanced excitatory input to granule cells, suggesting that circuit dysfunction is due to excessive excitation rather than impaired inhibition. We confirmed that both optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal cortex and selective chemogenetic inhibition of DG PV-INs lowered seizure threshold in vivo in young adult Scn1a+/- mice. Optogenetic activation of PV-INs, on the other hand, normalized evoked responses in granule cells in vitro. These results establish the corticohippocampal circuit as a key locus of pathology in Scn1a+/- mice and suggest that PV-INs retain powerful inhibitory function and may be harnessed as a potential therapeutic approach toward seizure modulation.",

abstract = "Miniature microscopes have gained considerable traction for in vivo calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, extracting calcium signals from raw videos is a computationally complex problem and remains a bottleneck for many researchers utilizing single-photon in vivo calcium imaging. Despite the existence of many powerful analysis packages designed to detect and extract calcium dynamics, most have either key parameters that are hard-coded or insufficient step-by-step guidance and validations to help the users choose the best parameters. This makes it difficult to know whether the output is reliable and meets the assumptions necessary for proper analysis. Moreover, large memory demand is often a constraint for setting up these pipelines since it limits the choice of hardware to specialized computers. Given these difficulties, there is a need for a low memory demand, user-friendly tool offering interactive visualizations of how altering parameters at each step of the analysis affects data output. Our open-source analysis pipeline, Minian (miniscope analysis), facilitates the transparency and accessibility of single-photon calcium imaging analysis, permitting users with little computational experience to extract the location of cells and their corresponding calcium traces and deconvolved neural activities. Minian contains interactive visualization tools for every step of the analysis, as well as detailed documentation and tips on parameter exploration. Furthermore, Minian has relatively small memory demands and can be run on a laptop, making it available to labs that do not have access to specialized computational hardware. Minian has been validated to reliably and robustly extract calcium events across different brain regions and from different cell types. In practice, Minian provides an open-source calcium imaging analysis pipeline with user-friendly interactive visualizations to explore parameters and validate results.",

abstract = "Febrile seizures, in addition to being the most common seizure type of the developing human, may contribute to the generation of subsequent limbic epilepsy. Our previous work has demonstrated that prolonged experimental febrile seizures in the immature rat model increased hippocampal excitability long term, enhancing susceptibility to future seizures. The mechanisms for these profound proepileptogenic changes did not require cell death and were associated with long-term slowed kinetics of the hyperpolarization-activated depolarizing current (I(H)). Here we show that these seizures modulate the expression of genes encoding this current, the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCNs): In CA1 neurons expressing multiple HCN isoforms, the seizures induced a coordinated reduction of HCN1 mRNA and enhancement of HCN2 expression, thus altering the neuronal HCN phenotype. The seizure-induced augmentation of HCN2 expression involved CA3 in addition to CA1, whereas for HCN4, mRNA expression was not changed by the seizures in either hippocampal region. This isoform- and region-specific transcriptional regulation of the HCNs required neuronal activity rather than hyperthermia alone, correlated with seizure duration, and favored the formation of slow-kinetics HCN2-encoded channels. In summary, these data demonstrate a novel, activity-dependent transcriptional regulation of HCN molecules by developmental seizures. These changes result in long-lasting alteration of the HCN phenotype of specific hippocampal neuronal populations, with profound consequences on the excitability of the hippocampal network.",

abstract = "Animal models of epilepsy have shown that synchronous burst firing is associated with epileptogenesis, yet the evidence from human studies linking neuronal synchrony and burst firing to epileptogenesis remains equivocal. Sleep-wake states have been shown to differentially modulate the generation of epileptiform EEG spikes between brain regions of greater and lesser seizure-generating potential, providing information that helps to identify the primary epileptogenic region. Using these state-dependent mechanisms to assist us in identifying neuronal correlates of human epilepsy, we recorded interictal neuronal activity from mesial temporal lobe (MTL) areas in epileptic patients implanted with depth electrodes required for medical diagnosis during polysomnographically defined sleep-wake states. Results show that single neurons recorded ipsilateral to seizure-initiating MTL (``epileptic'') areas had significantly higher firing rates (p = 0.01) and burst propensity (p = 0.01) and greater synchrony of discharges (p = 0.003) compared with neurons recorded from contralateral non-seizure-generating MTL (``non-epileptic'') areas. In particular, during episodes of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, epileptic hippocampal neurons had significantly higher burst rates compared with non-epileptic hippocampal neurons (both p = 0.01). In contrast, during episodes of wakefulness (Aw), no difference in burst firing between epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampal neurons was observed. Furthermore, synchronous firing was significantly higher between epileptic MTL neurons compared with non-epileptic MTL neurons during SWS (p = 0.04) and REM sleep (p = 0.02), but no difference in neuronal synchrony was found between epileptic and non-epileptic neurons during Aw. These results provide evidence that sleep states differentially modulate abnormal epileptogenic neuronal discharge properties within human MTL and confirm that neuronal burst firing and enhanced neuronal synchrony observed in experimental animal models of epilepsy characterizes human epilepsy as well.",

abstract = "Each year an estimated 1.5 million people sustain traumatic brain injury, and brain trauma is the leading cause of death and disability among young adults (34; 55; 76; 92; 215). Head injury is one of the most significant risk factors for epilepsy and 5\% of head trauma survivors develop post-traumatic epilepsy (8). Although clinical studies have found an association between head injury and temporal lobe epilepsy (67; 100; 141; 175; 237), the mechanisms leading to the development of post-traumatic epilepsy are not understood. Post-mortem examinations of head-injured patients often reveal selective damage to the dentate gyrus (30; 135). Animal models of head injury have shown that the interneurons in the dentate granule cell layer are preferentially injured during trauma, whereas the neighboring granule cells appeared unchanged (174; 224). This pattern of injury could also be observed when the trauma was delivered after the brain has been fixed, cooled and loaded with glutamate receptor antagonists, indicating that purely mechanical processes may play important roles in selective interneuronal vulnerability. A difference in the intracellular supporting structures between interneurons and granule cells could contribute to the differential susceptibility to mechanical insults. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 describe my studies demonstrating that the cytoskeleton in the selectively vulnerable interneurons is different from the neighboring granule cells. Hilar mossy cells are also damaged and lost after head trauma and in epilepsy (30; 53; 126; 135; 224). Chapter 4 reviews the proposed role of mossy cells in epilepsy. One major hypothesis of epileptogenesis, the ``dormant basket cell hypothesis'', proposed that the loss of the glutamatergic mossy cells removes excitatory synapses from interneurons (e.g. basket cells that inhibit granule cells), making these interneurons hypo-active (``dormant'') (205), and causing dentate hyperexcitability. Chapter 5 describes my work showing that the acute ablation of hilar mossy cells actually causes granule cell hypoexcitability and therefore does not underlie epileptogenesis.",

abstract = "Changes in the expression of ion channels, contributing to altered neuronal excitability, are emerging as possible mechanisms in the development of certain human epilepsies. In previous immature rodent studies of experimental prolonged febrile seizures, isoform-specific changes in the expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels (HCNs) correlated with long-lasting hippocampal hyperexcitability and enhanced seizure susceptibility. Prolonged early-life seizures commonly precede human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), suggesting that transcriptional dysregulation of HCNs might contribute to the epileptogenic process. Therefore, we determined whether HCN isoform expression was modified in hippocampi of individuals with TLE. HCN1 and HCN2 expression were measured using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry in hippocampi from three groups: TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (HS; n = 17), epileptic hippocampi without HS, or non-HS (NHS; n = 10), and autopsy material (n = 10). The results obtained in chronic human epilepsy were validated by examining hippocampi from the pilocarpine model of chronic TLE. In autopsy and most NHS hippocampi, HCN1 mRNA expression was substantial in pyramidal cell layers and lower in dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs). In contrast, HCN1 mRNA expression over the GC layer and in individual GCs from epileptic hippocampus was markedly increased once GC neuronal density was reduced by >50\%. HCN1 mRNA changes were accompanied by enhanced immunoreactivity in the GC dendritic fields and more modest changes in HCN2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, similar robust and isoform-selective augmentation of HCN1 mRNA expression was evident also in the pilocarpine animal model of TLE. These findings indicate that the expression of HCN isoforms is dynamically regulated in human as well as in experimental hippocampal epilepsy. After experimental febrile seizures (i.e., early in the epileptogenic process), the preserved and augmented inhibition onto principal cells may lead to reduced HCN1 expression. In contrast, in chronic epileptic HS hippocampus studied here, the profound loss of interneuronal and principal cell populations and consequent reduced inhibition, coupled with increased dendritic excitation of surviving GCs, might provoke a ``compensatory'' enhancement of HCN1 mRNA and protein expression.",

abstract = "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is an idiopathic focal epilepsy syndrome with auditory symptoms and/or receptive aphasia as prominent ictal manifestations. The most common auditory symptoms are simple unformed sounds including humming, buzzing, or ringing; less common forms are distortions (e.g., volume changes) or complex sounds (e.g., specific songs or voices). Ictal receptive aphasia consists of a sudden onset of inability to understand language in the absence of general confusion. Less commonly, other ictal symptoms may occur, including sensory symptoms (visual, olfactory, vertiginous, or cephalic), or motor, psychic, and autonomic symptoms. Most affected individuals have secondarily generalized seizures, usually accompanied by simple partial and complex partial seizures, with auditory symptoms as a major simple partial seizure manifestation. Some persons have seizures precipitated by sounds such as a ringing telephone. Age at onset ranges from four to 50 years but is usually in adolescence or early adulthood. The clinical course of ADPEAF is benign. Seizures are usually well controlled after initiation of medical therapy. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ADPEAF is established by clinical findings, family history, and normal brain imaging studies (MRI or CT). A pathogenic variant in LGI1 has been identified in approximately one third of affected families. A pathogenic variant in RELN has been identified in seven affected families. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Seizure control is usually readily achieved with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used routinely in clinical practice (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Interviewing relatives at risk to identify those with suggestive symptoms may enable early treatment in those who develop seizures. GENETIC COUNSELING: ADPEAF is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with ADPEAF have an affected parent; the proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is believed to be very low. Each child of an individual with ADPEAF has a 50\% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The chance that the offspring who inherits the pathogenic variant will manifest ADPEAF is between 55\% and 78\%, depending on the penetrance. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known. However, requests for prenatal testing for conditions which (like ADPEAF) do not affect intellect and are usually easily treated are not common.",

abstract = "Abstract According to current diagnosis criteria, first seizures constitute beginning epilepsy when they carry recurrence risks of $\geq$60\% over the next 10 years. This is frequently the case and warrants AED treatment. Evidence argues against deferring treatment when provoking factors such as sleep deprivation are reported. There are several characteristics of first seizures which markedly increase recurrence risk but not clearly beyond 60\%. This includes status epilepticus or seizure flurries at first manifestation or focal semiology indicating focal epilepsy. In this situation, there are still various medical, social and individual aspects supporting early initiation of AED. Modern AED allow this safely and at low dosages.",

abstract = "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases in the world; however, a significant number of individuals suffer from uncontrollable epilepsy, placing them at higher risk for post-ictal cardiorespiratory failure and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). A landmark study (MORTEMUS) revealed commonalities in the sequence of events leading to SUDEP in patients, which begins with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) followed by respiratory rate suppression, heart rate suppression, and then then respiratory followed by cardiac arrest. Data from our lab using a novel audiogenic seizure rat model (SSkcnj16-/- rats) showed that GTCSs leads to acute respiratory and heart rate suppression which is exacerbated after repeated GTCSs. However, knowledge gaps remain in understanding how repeated seizures lead to this progressive cardiorespiratory dysfunction. Emerging evidence has shown a strong association between neuroinflammation, seizures and epilepsy. Eliciting seizures in different rodent models of epilepsy has led to recruitment of various inflammatory mediators and activation of microglia and astrocytes. This starts a cascade of events leading to the release of cytokines, chemokines and proteases that can damage the surrounding neuronal architecture and even damage the blood brain barrier (BBB) to recruit peripheral immune cells. Clinical studies have shown that severe GTCSs lead to increased levels of cytokines and chemokines in patient serum and samples. Importantly, researchers and clinicians alike are investigating utilizing different anti-inflammatory drugs to help patients with epilepsy reduce the severity and frequency of seizures. Data from human patients who have succumbed to SUDEP show that chemokine receptors and their ligands, such as CCR2/CCL2 and CXCR5/CXCL13, are upregulated in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in hippocampal, cortical, and cerebellar regions. Therefore, the overarching goal of this project was to understand if repeated seizures lead to neuroinflammation in critical regions of the brainstem important for cardiorespiratory control, and within these regions which cell types play a role, and finally if blocking inflammation may prevent the cardiorespiratory suppression and mortality in our rat model of repeated seizure.Here, I focused on 4 brainstem nuclei critical for cardiorespiratory control: the pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex (preB{\"o}tC; critical for respiratory rhythm generation), the nucleus ambiguous (NA; autonomic and respiratory functions), the B{\"o}tzinger complex (B{\"o}tC; inhibition of inspiration, active expiration), and the medullary raphe nuclei which contains serotonergic (5-HT) neurons that provide critical excitatory drive to breathe and chemoreceptor function. The lab has previously shown that repeated seizures over 10 days led to exacerbation of respiratory rate suppression. In addition, repeated seizure led to increases in Iba-1 (marker for activated microglia) and GFAP (astrocyte/gliosis marker). Preliminary single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) within the medullary raphe indicated the recruitment of inflammation in glia and IL1 signaling activation resulting from repeated seizures. These and other data supported the rationale for my work focusing on key brainstem regions involved in cardiorespiratory control and how seizures potentially lead to inflammation. My initial aim focused on determining if inflammation was present after seizure induction(s) within the brainstem cardiorespiratory control network. To investigate this, animals were exposed no seizures (na{\"\i}ve) or to one seizure/day (d) for 3, 7, or 10 d and NA/preB{\"o}tC was isolated for snRNAseq. Importantly, although it has been shown that this brainstem region contains key neuronal populations that are necessary to generate breathing rhythms, the complete cellular composition of this site is not known. Using this approach, I demonstrated that not only were there several subtypes of neurons present in this region, but also that there are subtle but potentially important differences in cellular expression patterns between male and female rats. Furthermore, this study showed that repeated seizures differentially effect microglia and astrocytes in terms of the induction of specific inflammatory pathways, suggesting their activation could result in either a ``pro-inflammatory'' or ``anti-inflammatory'' phenotype. To further clarify which specific cytokines/chemokines may be changing after repeated seizures in this region, I next collected tissues from this region and others in the brainstem and measured inflammatory molecules using a cytokine array for comparison across the na{\"\i}ve state to 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 d of repeated seizures. The NA/preB{\"o}tC showed the greatest number of significant changes in cytokines, where multiple cytokines were increased especially at 5 d with few changes in cytokines were observed in other brainstem regions across time. This suggested a time- and site-dependent effect of repeated seizures to uniquely increase inflammation within this important brainstem site. My second aim focuses on preventing the adverse effects of repeated seizures in our model by utilizing different classes of anti-inflammatory drugs. Among several cytokines and other inflammation-related molecules we noted that repeated seizures increased IL-1{\ss} and IL-1$\alpha$. Therefore, we sought to broadly inhibit inflammation using a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID; ketoprofen), and a specific antagonist to IL-1 receptors, anakinra, to asses if administration of these drugs could improve ventilatory outcomes and prevent seizure-induced mortality across a 10 d seizure protocol. Interestingly, anakinra and ketoprofen were able to prevent some of the respiratory suppression in the immediate post-ictal period (within 15 min), with anakinra having what appeared to be the most beneficial effects by blocking the progressively enhanced respiratory rate suppression across the 10d of seizure. However, animals treated with ketoprofen showed effects like vehicle-treated rats where respiratory rate suppression increased by 4-6 d and had worsened further by 7-10 d than those treated with anakinra. Although anakinra prevented the progressive effect, it was not able to increase survival across the 10d period (not different than vehicle). However, ketoprofen prevented seizure-related mortality despite the lack of effects during the acute post-ictal period. These results suggest that the different pathways may have differential import in this ventilatory system, meaning that IL-1 signaling may be important in acute breathing control post-ictally, but cyclooxygenase (COX) signaling may play a stronger role in preventing mortality with chronic treatment.Overall, these results suggest that repeated seizures induce neuroinflammation in key regions of cardiorespiratory control in a time-and site-dependent manner which involved multiple cell types and signaling pathways. The gene expression profiling data suggests that astrocytes are contributing to the inflammatory pathways recruited after repeated seizures, consistent with previous studies. Moreover, the drug studies herein indicate that blocking the progressive worsening of acute respiratory suppression in the immediate post-ictal period is not sufficient to increase survival after repeated seizures, and that seizure-induced inflammation mediated through COX signaling may have a greater role in seizure-induced mortality in our model. This work provides a deeper understanding of how repeated seizures may drive neuroinflammation in a critical region of the brainstem and highlights a disconnect between respiratory control dysfunction in the immediate post-ictal period and seizure-related mortality.",

title = "The brain beating and heart breathing: a unifying theory of the neuro- cardiac- respiratory control in infant and adult sudden unexpected deaths",
author = "Paradiso, Beatrice",
abstract = "Background: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is characterized by the death of an infant that cannot be explained, despite a systematic case examination, including death scene investigation, autopsy and review of the clinical history. Nowadays, Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) is a wide-ranging concept used to describe any sudden and unexpected death, whether explained or unexplained, including SIDS, which occurs during the first year of life. Several differing and sometimes contradictory hypotheses of the underlying mechanisms of SIDS have been proposed. The most reliable seems to be the ``triple risk hypothesis''. Based on this theory, unexpected infant deaths might arise as a consequence of the combination of three factors coming together: a vulnerable infant, a vulnerable phase of development and a final insult occurring in this window of vulnerability. Recently, a unified neuropathological theory contributes to describing SIDS. According to this, serotonergic neurons play a crucial homeostatic function in the cardiorespiratory brainstem centres. A high incidence of morphological abnormalities and biochemical defects of serotoninergic neurotransmission have been reported in the brainstem of SIDS victims. This brain region includes the main nuclei and structures that coordinate the vital activities, such as cardiovascular function and breathing, perinatal and after birth. Nevertheless, evidence suggests likely genomic complexity and a degree of overlap among SIDS, Sudden Intrauterine Death (SIUD), Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). In SUDEP, which has clinical parallels with SIDS, alterations to medullary serotoninergic neural populations and autonomic dysregulation have been shown too. Molecular profiling of SUDEP cases and the investigation of genetic models have directed to the identification of putative SUDEP genes of which most are ion channel active along the neurocardiac, neuroautonomic, and neurorespiratory pathway. Concurrently, anomalous time- activation, transcription or regional expression of candidate neuro-cardiac-respiratory genes implicated for SUDEP, could be similarly involved in other unexpected sudden deaths. A small but significant proportion of infants who die suddenly and unexpectedly have been shown on postmortem genetic testing to have Developmental Serotonopathies, Cardiac Channelopathies and Autonomic Nervous System Dysregulation, with considerable implications for surviving and future family members. This has led to the demonstration that neuro-cardiac genes are expressed in both tissues (brain and heart) and recently in the respiratory system. Aim: Despite their decreasing incidence, SIDS and SUDEP are still important causes of death. There are many nuclei in the cardio and respiratory centres of the brain involved in unexpected and sudden deaths. Cardiac, sympathetic, and respiratory motor activities can be viewed as a unified rhythm controlled by brainstem neural circuits for effective and efficient gas exchange. We aim to describe abnormalities in these nuclei, in part because robust molecular or functional examination of these nuclei has not been carefully performed. We intend to perform detailed functional mapping of these brainstem nuclei. Specifically, the cardiorespiratory and cardioventilatory coupling can be understood as a unified vital rhythm controlled by brainstem neural circuits. By cardiorespiratory coupling, we mean the Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) that is characterized by a heart rate (HR) increasing during inspiration and an HR decrease during expiration. Conversely, Cardioventilatory coupling (CVC) is considered the influence of heartbeats and arterial pulse pressure on respiration with the tendency for the next inspiration to start at a preferred latency after the last heartbeat in expiration. We hypothesized that these two reflex systems are not separate, but constitute an integrated network. We defined this last concept as ``unifying theory''. By studying all the maps of the cardiorespiratory nuclei of the Literature, we integrated this concept into a reworking map of brainstem nuclei that could also explain the gasping and blocking cardiorespiratory of sudden deaths. The theory of a unique, unifying cardiorespiratory network, it has been recently demonstrated in some cases of arrhythmia, in some cases of SUDEP with striking systolic hypotensive changes and in some cases of SIDS too. Material and Methods: We investigated articles, reviews indexed in PubMed describing putative neuro-cardiac-respiratory genes and cardiorespiratory, and cardioventilatory coupling theories. Specifically, we evaluated cardiorespiratory brainstem nuclei and whole brains of fetal, infant and adult autopsies respectively to detect congenital errors in the cerebral development or malformations, but also to identify the ``normal'' or ``dysplastic'' brainstem centres. Results: Based on the Literature, we identified a brain-heart gene mapping and a scheme of cardiorespiratory brainstem nuclei network. Contemporary, we collected a large pool of fetal brain malformations and cardiorespiratory nuclei dysgenesis both in infants both in adult sudden deaths. We found dysgenesia, agenesia and hypoplasia of brainstem nuclei associated with SIDS cases, compared with post-mortem infant control cases. However, the arcuate nucleus showed insignificant inter-variations regarding adults autoptic cases. Discussion: Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors increase fetal, perinatal, infant, and adult sudden death susceptibility. The final common pathway for SIDS and SUDEP involves a failure to arouse and autoresuscitate in response to environmental challenge. The different risk factors, among these a prone position, can directly alter the function of cardiorespiratory nuclei and impair the ability of this network to coordinate cardiorespiratory--cardioventilatory coupling. Conclusions: Neuropathological analysis of the infant brainstem and neuro-cardiac-respiratory gene mapping represents a good tool to infer on the final events of SIDS and SUDEP, although nothing it is clear regarding the role of adult cardiorespiratory centres. An integrated study of postmortem neuropathology and molecular autopsies could help to understand the network of this beating-breathing-thinking unit.",

The onset of the seizures was much more rapid (2-45 min vs 3-7 h) than in adult rats, and the convulsant doses were much lower (50 x 10(-12) mol per gram brain weight vs 750 x 10(-12) mol per gram brain weight in adults).

CRH-induced seizures occurred prior to any changes in serum corticosterone, and were eliminated by the administration of a CRH antagonist, as well as of phenytoin.

title = "Characterization and stress induced modulations of {RXFP3+} neurons in the mouse {BNST}",
author = "Fu, Jr, Jingjing",
abstract = "Stress induced relapse and stressful emotional responses occurring during drug withdrawal are common problems for drug addicts. The relaxin-3/relaxin family peptide receptor 3 (RXFP3) system modulates stress responses and reward seeking behaviour. RXFP3 is expressed within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and bilateral intra-BNST injections of an RXFP3 antagonist decreased self-administration and stress induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking in rats. The electrophysiological properties of RXFP3+ neurons in the BNST and whether they are responsive to stress are presently not known. Similarly, the possibility of convergent signalling with other neuropeptides such as corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the BNST is not clear either. Therefore, whole cell recordings were conducted on defined RXFP3+ neurons in brain slices taken from adult RXFP3-Cre x tdTomato mice (n=38 mice for naive group). To study any alterations in RXFP3+ dorsal BNST neurons induced by chronic stress, a group of mice (n=13) were subjected to swim stress daily for 5 days. Mice were anaesthetised (5\% isoflurane), decapitated and 250 µm coronal slices through the BNST were obtained. Based on Hammack's characterization, the majority of recorded RXFP3+ neurons (~75\%) were classified as Type II neurons and a new type of neuron, Type IV neurons were found within the dorsal BNST. Surprisingly, the electrophysiological profile of RXFP3+ neurons was not fixed; five days of swim stress induced plasticity, shifting a population of Type II neurons to Type III or Type IV neurons. Notably, stress induced plasticity of BNST RXFP3+ neurons was not only found in terms of neuron types, but also in their responsiveness to afferent inputs. The decay time of both spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (P=0.0005, Mann-Whitney test) and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (P=0.0028, Mann-Whitney test) were significantly increased after stress (naive, n=70 cells from 38 mice; stress, n=32 cells from 13 mice). Most BNST RXFP3+ neurons from the naive group (6 out of 9) were hyperpolarised following bath application of a selective RXFP3 agonist (A2, 100 nM), in line with an inhibitory role of this neuropeptide. Bath application of CRF (100 or 300 nM) onto brain slices during gap free voltage clamp recordings were conducted (n=14) to examine potential interactions between these peptide systems. CRF induced an increase of GABA release onto RXFP3+ neurons (~40\% of the RXFP3+ neurons recorded), but decreased GABA release for ~35\% of RXFP3+ neurons. In addition, CRF also caused direct postsynaptic effects on RXFP3+ neurons. Overall, these experiments have helped to elucidate the electrophysiological properties of RXFP3+ BNST cells, their responsiveness to stress, their interaction with a prototypic stress neuropeptide and their potential role in stress induced reward-seeking.",

METHODS: Direct treatment-related costs of epilepsy from onset through 6 years were derived from billing and medical chart data for 608 population-based incident cases at two sites in different regions of the country. Indirect productivity-related costs were derived from a survey of 1,168 adult patients visiting regional treatment centers. Direct costs separate the effects of epilepsy and comorbidity conditions. Indirect costs account for the effects of other disabilities and socioeconomic conditions on foregone earnings and household activity. The estimates were applied to 1995 population figures to derive national projections of the lifetime and annual costs of the disorder. RESULTS: The lifetime cost of epilepsy for an estimated 181,000 people with onset in 1995 is projected at $11.1 billion, and the annual cost for the estimated 2.3 million prevalent cases is estimated at $12.5 billion. Indirect costs account for 85\% of the total and, with direct costs, are concentrated in people with intractable epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: Direct costs attributable to epilepsy are below previous estimates. Indirect costs adjusted for the socioeconomic conditions of patients are above previous estimates. Findings indicate that epilepsy is unique in the large proportion of costs that are productivity-related, justifying further investment in the development of effective interventions.",

abstract = "Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy display neuron loss in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. This has been proposed to be epileptogenic by a variety of different mechanisms. The present study examines the specificity and extent of neuron loss in the dentate gyrus of kainate-treated rats, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Kainate-treated rats lose an average of 52\% of their GAD-negative hilar neurons (putative mossy cells) and 13\% of their GAD-positive cells (GABAergic interneurons) in the dentate gyrus. Interneuron loss is remarkably specific; 83\% of the missing GAD-positive neurons are somatostatin-immunoreactive. Of the total neuron loss in the hilus, 97\% is attributed to two cell types-mossy cells and somatostatinergic interneurons. The retrograde tracer wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-apoHRP-gold was used to identify neurons with appropriate axon projections for generating lateral inhibition. Previously, it was shown that lateral inhibition between regions separated by 1 mm persists in the dentate gyrus of kainate-treated rats with hilar neuron loss. Retrogradely labeled GABAergic interneurons are found consistently in sections extending 1 mm septotemporally from the tracer injection site in control and kainate-treated rats. Retrogradely labeled putative mossy cells are found up to 4 mm from the injection site, but kainate-treated rats have fewer than controls, and in several kainate-treated rats virtually all of these cells are missing. These findings support hypotheses of temporal lobe epileptogenesis that involve mossy cell and somatostatinergic neuron loss and suggest that lateral inhibition in the dentate gyrus does not require mossy cells but, instead, may be generated directly by GABAergic interneurons.",

abstract = "We used the pilocarpine model of chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures to evaluate the time course of supragranular dentate sprouting and to assess the relation between several changes that occur in epileptic tissue with different behavioral manifestations of this experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) invariably led to cell loss in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) and to spontaneous recurrent seizures. Cell loss was often also noted in the DG and in hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3. The seizures began to appear at a mean of 15 days after SE induction (silent period), recurred at variable frequencies for each animal, and lasted for as long as the animals were allowed to survive (325 days). The granule cell layer of the DG was dispersed in epileptic animals, and neo-Timm stains showed supra- and intragranular mossy fiber sprouting. Supragranular mossy fiber sprouting and dentate granule cell dispersion began to appear early after SE (as early as 4 and 9 days, respectively) and reached a plateau by 100 days. Animals with a greater degree of cell loss in hippocampal field CA3 showed later onset of chronic epilepsy (r = 0.83, p < 0.0005), suggesting that CA3 represents one of the routes for seizure spread. These results demonstrate that the pilocarpine model of chronic seizures replicates several of the features of human temporal lobe epilepsy (hippocampal cell loss, supra- and intragranular mossy fiber sprouting, dentate granule cell dispersion, spontaneous recurrent seizures) and that it may be a useful model for studying this human condition. The results also suggest that even though a certain amount of cell loss in specific areas may be essential for chronic seizures to occur, excessive cell loss may hinder epileptogenesis.",

abstract = "The research described in this thesis aims to increase understanding of cardiac comorbidities and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). People with epilepsy have a three-fold increased risk of dying prematurely compared to the general population. Common contributors to this are cardiovascular comorbidities, of which I provide an overview. Cardiovascular conditions and epilepsy can both lead to transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) with overlapping semiology. Particularly, myoclonic jerks which are commonly observed during syncope can be mistaken for signs of epilepsy. A misdiagnosis with detrimental consequences. I provide evidence that a careful analysis of motor phenomena can distinguish the two conditions. SUDEP is the commonest direct epilepsy-related premature death (UK >500 people/year). It typically occurs following convulsive seizures (CS). Most victims are found prone and some suggested people should sleep supine. I assessed video-EEG recordings of 180 CS and demonstrated peri-ictal positions often change, and most ending prone turned during CS. Sleeping supine is thus unlikely to prevent a postictal prone position and reduce risk of SUDEP. Pathomechanisms underlying SUDEP are likely a combination of interacting cardiorespiratory and autonomic factors. People with Dravet syndrome (DS) have a particular high SUDEP risk. I show that 49\% of reported deaths in DS are SUDEP cases, most <10 years (78\%). In DS, SCN1A mutations are mostly found, encoding a sodium channel expressed in brain and heart. DS mouse models suggest a key role for peri-ictal cardiac arrhythmias in SUDEP. I conducted a multicentre observational study and recorded 547 seizures in 45 DS participants. No major peri-ictal arrhythmias were found. Peri-ictal QTc-lengthening was, however, more common in DS than controls. This may reflect unstable repolarisation and increased propensity for arrhythmias. Prospective data to determine whether these peri-ictal variables can predict SUDEP risk is warranted.",

abstract = "Long-lasting changes in synaptic function (i.e., synaptic plasticity) have long been thought to contribute to information storage in the nervous system. Although synaptic plasticity mainly has adaptive functions that allow the organism to function in complex environments, it is now clear that certain events or exposure to various substances can produce plasticity that has negative consequences for organisms. Exposure to drugs of abuse, in particular ethanol, is a life experience that can activate or alter synaptic plasticity, often resulting in increased drug seeking and taking and in many cases addiction.Two brain regions subject to alcohol's effects on synaptic plasticity are the striatum and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), both of which have key roles in alcohol's actions and control of intake. The specific effects depend on both the brain region analyzed (e.g., specific subregions of the striatum and BNST) and the duration of ethanol exposure (i.e., acute vs. chronic). Plastic changes in synaptic transmission in these two brain regions following prolonged ethanol exposure are thought to contribute to excessive alcohol drinking and relapse to drinking. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this plasticity may lead to new therapies for treatment of these and other aspects of alcohol use disorder.",

author = "Zappone, Colin Anthony",
abstract = "Hippocampal associational and commissural pathways of the dentate gyrus include inhibitory and excitatory elements, but which inhibitory and excitatory neurons contribute to this pathway remain unclear. In addition, it is not known whether hilar mossy cells establish a recurrent excitatory network with dentate granule cells or generate lateral inhibition by activating inhibitory neurons. Improved methods for detecting neuronal markers and the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG) were used to identify associationally and commissurally projecting neurons of the rat hippocampus and describe their three-dimensional organization. FG-positive, commissurally projecting interneurons of the dentate granule cell layer and hilus were detected in numbers greater than previously reported. FG labeling of interneurons was as high as 96\% of hilar somatostatin-positive interneurons, 84\% of parvalbumin-positive cells of the granule cell layer and hilus, and 33\% of hilar calretinin positive cells. Whereas hilar mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells were FG-labeled throughout the contralateral longitudinal axis, FG-positive interneurons exhibited a relatively homotopic distribution contralaterally. In addition, retrograde transport revealed that few inhibitory interneurons were among the many retrogradely labeled hilar neurons 2.5-4.5 mm longitudinal and ipsilateral to the FG injection site. Conversely, GluR2-positive hilar mossy cells were the only with significant longitudinal associational projections. During perforant pathway stimulation in urethane-anesthetized rats, diffusion of the GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide from the tip of a glass recording electrode evoked granule cell discharges and c-Fos expression in granule cells, mossy cells, and inhibitory interneurons within a ∼400 $\mu$m radius of the tip. This focally-evoked activity powerfully suppressed distant granule cell responses recorded ∼2.5-4.5 mm longitudinally. Three days after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus or prolonged perforant pathway stimulation, longitudinal inhibition was intact in rats with 85\%) hilar cell loss. These data suggest that hilar mossy cells establish surround inhibition by activating inhibitory neurons and that mossy cell loss, which is observed in the disease process of temporal lobe epilepsy, may represent a network-level mechanism underlying post-injury hippocampal dysfunction and epileptic network hyperexcitability.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: Interhemispheric propagation of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy is frequently noted during intracranial EEG monitoring. We hypothesized that a distinct secondary electrographic seizure (DSES) in the temporal lobe contralateral to primary seizure onset may be an unfavorable prognostic indicator. METHODS: We reviewed intracranial depth electrode EEG recordings, 1-year outcome, and medical records of 51 patients (M 29, F 22: age 15-64 years) who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy during 1988-96. We defined DSES as a seizure that spread to the contralateral temporal lobe and produced distinct contralateral EEG features. The distinct feature was focal involvement of one or two electrode contacts at onset, which starts and evolves independently from the ipsilateral temporal lobe. We considered DSES as the predominant seizure pattern when it occurred in more than one half of the patients' recorded seizures. RESULTS: Only nine of 19 (47\%) patients with predominant DSES had a 1-year seizure-free outcome, whereas 27 of 32 (84\%) patients without predominant DSES had a 1-year seizure-free outcome (p < 0.01). Bitemporal independent seizures were more common in patients with predominant DSES (9/19 versus 0/32; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that distinct contralateral secondary electrographic seizure is a predictor of unfavorable outcome and is also more likely to be associated with bitemporal seizures.",

title = "The recurrent mossy fiber pathway of the epileptic brain",
author = "Nadler, J Victor",
abstract = "The dentate gyrus is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy. In normal brain the dentate granule cells serve as a high-resistance gate or filter, inhibiting the propagation of seizures from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus. The filtering function of the dentate gyrus depends in part on the near absence of monosynaptic connections among granule cells. In humans with temporal lobe epilepsy and in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy, dentate granule cells form an interconnected synaptic network associated with loss of hilar interneurons. This recurrent mossy fiber pathway mediates reverberating excitation that can reduce the threshold for granule cell synchronization. Factors that augment activity in this pathway include modest increases in [K+]o; loss of GABA inhibition; short-term, frequency-dependent facilitation (frequencies of 1-2 Hz); feedback activation of kainate autoreceptors; and release of zinc from recurrent mossy fiber boutons. Factors that diminish activity include short-term, frequency-dependent depression (frequencies < 1 Hz); feedback activation of type II metabotropic glutamate receptors; and the potential release of GABA, neuropeptide Y, adenosine, and dynorphin from recurrent mossy fiber boutons. The axon sprouting and reactive synaptogenesis that follow seizure-related brain damage can also create or strengthen recurrent excitation in other brain regions. These changes are expected to facilitate participation of these regions in seizures. Thus, reactive processes that are often considered important for recovery of function after most brain injuries probably contribute to neurological dysfunction in epilepsy.",

abstract = "Whole-cell patch-clamp and extracellular field recordings were obtained from 450-microns-thick brain slices of infant rats (10-13 days postnatal) to determine the actions of corticotropin-releasing hormone on glutamate- and GABA-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Synthetic corticotropin-releasing hormone (0.15 microM) reversibly increased the excitability of hippocampal pyramidal cells, as determined by the increase in the amplitude of the CA1 population spikes evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway. This increase in population spike amplitude could be prevented by the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist alpha-helical (9-41)-corticotropin-releasing hormone (10 microM). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that, in the presence of blockers of fast excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, corticotropin-releasing hormone caused only a small (1-2 mV) depolarization of the resting membrane potential in CA3 pyramidal cells, and it did not significantly alter the input resistance. However, corticotropin-releasing hormone, in addition to decreasing the slow afterhyperpolarization, caused an increase in the number of action potentials per burst evoked by depolarizing current pulses. Corticotropin-releasing hormone did not significantly change the frequency, amplitude or kinetics of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. However, it increased the frequency of the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in CA3 pyramidal cells, without altering their amplitude and single exponential rise and decay time constants. Corticotropin-releasing hormone did not change the amplitude of the pharmacologically isolated (i.e. recorded in the presence of GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline) excitatory postsynaptic currents in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells evoked by stimulation of the mossy fibers and the Schaffer collaterals, respectively. Current-clamp recordings in bicuculline-containing medium showed that, in the presence of corticotropin-releasing hormone, mossy fiber stimulation leads to large, synchronized, polysynaptically-evoked bursts of action potentials in CA3 pyramidal cells. In addition, the peptide caused a small, reversible decrease in the amplitude of the pharmacologically isolated (i.e. recorded in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists) evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents in CA3 pyramidal cells, but it did not significantly alter the frequency, amplitude, rise and decay time constants of spontaneous or miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These data demonstrate that corticotropin-releasing hormone, an endogenous neuropeptide whose intracerebroventricular infusion results in seizure activity in immature rats, has diverse effects in the hippocampus which may contribute to epileptogenesis. It is proposed that the net effect of corticotropin-releasing hormone is a preferential amplification of those incoming excitatory signals which are strong enough to reach firing threshold in at least a subpopulation of CA3 cells. These findings suggest that the actions of corticotropin-releasing hormone on neuronal excitability in the immature hippocampus may play a role in human developmental epilepsies.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by febrile seizures (FS) and a variety of afebrile generalized seizure types. GEFS+ has previously been linked to mutations in two genes encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-subunit (SCN1A) and beta1-subunit (SCN1B). We studied a large family with FS and partial as well as generalized seizure types. METHODS: All but two living affected family members were interviewed and examined. Information on deceased affected family members was sought. EEG for 11 affected family members and one unaffected family member were obtained. Genetic linkage analysis and mutation screening of SCN1A were performed on blood samples from 16 affected individuals and their first-degree relatives. RESULTS: There were 27 affected family members; 18 were alive at the time of the study. All affected family members had FS; seven had FS only, and 19 also had afebrile seizures. Eleven individuals continued to have FS beyond 6 years of age. FS were complex in 12 family members, usually with prolonged duration. The index patient had right temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis. Four other patients had strong historical evidence of temporal lobe epilepsy, and three others had nonlocalizing evidence of partial epilepsy. Pedigree analysis indicated autosomal dominant transmission. All affected individuals who were tested and one asymptomatic individual had a sodium channel mutation of SCN1A, an A-->C transversion at nucleotide 3809 resulting in the substitution of lysine 1270 by threonine in the D3/S2 segment (designated as K1270T). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that partial epilepsy preceded by FS can be associated with sodium channel mutations and may represent a variant of GEFS+.",

abstract = "The cellular and network mechanisms of the transition of brief interictal discharges to prolonged seizures are a crucial issue in epilepsy. Here we used hippocampal slices exposed to ACSF containing 0 Mg(2+) to explore mechanisms for the transition to prolonged (3-42 sec) seizure-like (``ictal'') discharges. Epileptiform activity, evoked by Shaffer collateral stimulation, triggered prolonged bursts in CA1, in 50-60\% of slices, from both adult and young (postnatal day 13-21) rats. In these cases the first component of the CA1 epileptiform burst was followed by a train of population spikes at frequencies in the gamma band and above (30-120 Hz, reminiscent of tetanically evoked gamma oscillations). The gamma burst in turn could be followed by slower repetitive ``tertiary'' bursts. Intracellular recordings from CA1 during the gamma phase revealed long depolarizations, action potentials rising from brief apparent hyperpolarizations, and a drop of input resistance. The CA1 gamma rhythm was completely blocked by bicuculline (10-50 microm), by ethoxyzolamide (100 microm), and strongly attenuated in hyperosmolar perfusate (50 mm sucrose). Subsequent tertiary bursts were also blocked by bicuculline, ethoxyzolamide, and in hyperosmolar perfusate. In all these cases intracellular recordings from CA3 revealed only short depolarizations. We conclude that under epileptogenic conditions, gamma band oscillations arise from GABA(A)ergic depolarizations and that this activity may lead to the generation of ictal discharges.",

In TLE with hippocampal sclerosis, several lines of evidence implicate the hippocampus as the predominant focus of seizure origin and maintenance In sclerotic hippocampi, two major pathological processes are observed. (1) The reorganization of the neural circuitry of the dentate gyrus that favors the hyperexcitability of dentate granule cells. These changes include the loss of populations of subgranular hilar interneurons, hilar mossy cells and granule cells. Additionally there is sprouting of granule cell mossy fiber recurrent collaterals into the dentate inner molecular layer and the sprouting of neuropeptide Y, somatostatin and substance P containing axons throughout the molecular layer. (2) The second process consists of glial activation and proliferation throughout Ammon's horn along with neuronal loss. These astrocytes show a number of changes -- increased expression of specific glutamate receptors, redistribution of the water transporter AQP4, increased expression of Na+ and Ca2+ ion channels with down regulation of the Kir4.1 channels. The enzymes glutamine synthetase and lactate dehydrogenase are reduced whereas a number of molecules associated with immune function are upregulated. The density of the microvasculature is increased. The ``astrocytes'' associated with these changes may be subcategorized into two populations -- the strongly GFAP positive astrocytes and weakly GFAP reactive cells, which resemble the GluR astrocytes also known as NG2 cells. The functions of these two subpopulations may favor the creation of a high extracellular glutamate and K+ containing environment in the sclerotic hippocampus, which in turn may trigger seizure spread through a fairly normal subiculum. These changes may even provide an excitable substrate through which the hyperexcitability of dentate granule cells may spread out of the hippocampus to generate seizures.",

author = "Wuarin, J P and Dudek, F E",
abstract = "Temporal lobe epilepsy is usually associated with a latent period and an increased seizure frequency following a precipitating insult. After kainate treatment, the mossy fibers of the dentate gyrus are hypothesized to form recurrent excitatory circuits between granule cells, thus leading to a progressive increase in the excitatory input to granule cells. Three groups of animals were studied as a function of time after kainate treatment: 1-2 wk, 2-4 wk, and 10-51 wk. All the animals studied 10-51 wk after kainate treatment were observed to have repetitive spontaneous seizures. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings in hippocampal slices showed that the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in granule cells increased with time after kainate treatment. This increased excitatory synaptic input was correlated with the intensity of the Timm stain in the inner molecular layer (IML). Flash photolysis of caged glutamate applied in the granule cell layer evoked repetitive EPSCs in 10, 32, and 66\% of the granule cells at the different times after kainate treatment. When inhibition was reduced with bicuculline, photostimulation of the granule cell layer evoked epileptiform bursts of action potentials only in granule cells from rats 10-51 wk after kainate treatment. These data support the hypothesis that kainate-induced mossy fiber sprouting in the IML results in the progressive formation of aberrant excitatory connections between granule cells. They also suggest that the probability of occurrence of electrographic seizures in the dentate gyrus increases with time after kainate treatment.",

author = "Brandt, C and Potschka, H and L{\"o}scher, W and Ebert, U",
abstract = "Most patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of epilepsy, show pronounced loss of neurons in limbic brain regions, including the hippocampus. The massive neurodegeneration in the hippocampus is known as hippocampal sclerosis, and is considered one of the hallmarks of this type of difficult-to-treat epilepsy. There is a long and ongoing debate on whether this sclerosis is the result of an initial pathological event, such as a status epilepticus (S.E.), stroke or head trauma, which often precedes the development of TLE, or is caused by the spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) once epilepsy has developed. At present, pharmacological prevention of limbic sclerosis is not available. In a clinical situation, such prevention would only be possible if delayed cell death developing after an initial pathological event is involved. Assuming that sclerotic brain lesions provoke epileptogenesis and that delayed cell death is involved in these lesions, it should be possible to prevent both the lesions and the epilepsy by a prophylactic treatment after an initial insult such as an S.E. In order to test this hypothesis, we used a rat model of TLE in which limbic brain lesions and epilepsy with SRS develop after a kainate-induced S.E. A single low dose of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker dizocilpine (MK-801) significantly reduced the damage in limbic regions, including the hippocampus and piriform cortex, and completely protected several rats from such damage when given after an S.E. of 90 min induced by kainate, strongly suggesting that delayed cell death is involved in the damage. This was substantiated by the use of molecular and immunohistochemical markers of delayed active (``programmed'') cell death. However, the neuroprotection by dizocilpine did not prevent the development of SRS after the S.E., suggesting that structures not protected by dizocilpine may play a role in the genesis of SRS or that epileptogenesis is not the consequence of structural lesions in the limbic system. The only brain regions that exhibited neuronal damage in all rats with SRS were the hilus of the dentate gyrus and the mediodorsal thalamus, although treatment with dizocilpine reduced the severity of damage in the latter region. The data indicate that NMDA receptor blockade immediately after a prolonged S.E. is an effective means to reduce the damage produced by a sustained S.E. in several brain regions, including the hippocampus, but show that this partial neuroprotection of the limbic system does not prevent the development of epilepsy.",

author = "Moln{\'a}r, P and Nadler, J V",
abstract = "Dentate granule cells become synaptically interconnected in the hippocampus of persons with temporal lobe epilepsy, forming a recurrent mossy fiber pathway. This pathway may contribute to the development and propagation of seizures. The physiology of mossy fiber-granule cell synapses is difficult to characterize unambiguously, because electrical stimulation may activate other pathways and because there is a low probability of granule cell interconnection. These problems were addressed by the use of scanning laser photostimulation in slices of the caudal hippocampal formation. Glutamate was released from a caged precursor with highly focused ultraviolet light to evoke action potentials in a small population of granule cells. Excitatory synaptic currents were recorded in the presence of bicuculline. Minimal laser photostimulation evoked an apparently unitary excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) in 61\% of granule cells from rats that had experienced pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus followed by recurrent mossy fiber growth. An EPSC was also evoked in 13-16\% of granule cells from the control groups. EPSCs from status epilepticus and control groups had similar peak amplitudes ( approximately 30 pA), 20-80\% rise times (approximately 1.2 ms), decay time constants ( approximately 10 ms), and half-widths (approximately 8 ms). The mean failure rate was high (approximately 70\%) in both groups, and in both groups activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors contributed a small component to the EPSC. The strong similarity between responses from the status epilepticus and control groups suggests that they resulted from activation of a similar synaptic population. No EPSC was recorded when the laser beam was focused in the dentate hilus, suggesting that indirect activation of hilar mossy cells contributed little, if at all, to these results. Recurrent mossy fiber growth increases the density of mossy fiber-granule cell synapses in the caudal dentate gyrus by perhaps sixfold, but the new synapses appear to operate very similarly to preexisting mossy fiber-granule cell synapses.",

Subjective manifestations were described in all cases, more frequently in a sensory rather than an emotional or psychological fashion. Focal seizures limited to subjective features were recorded in two patients. In one, psychological illusions and visual hallucinations were related to the superior frontal sulcus. Another presented isolated paraesthesia in the left arm with the implication of the supplementary motor area. Electrical stimulation of an electrode located in the premotor area evoked isolated subjective manifestations in three other patients. One patient reported sensory manifestations and another, ideational manifestations. Cephalic sensations and emotional manifestations were associated in one case. Subjective manifestations were observed in all patients, and were proved to be related to a discharge restricted to the premotor area in five. These were non-specific signs, but were always the same in a given patient. Spontaneous, isolated sensations and stimulation data tended to be contradictory. This illustrates the complexity of analyzing subjective signs, as well as the complexity of the neuronal networks participating in the propagation of discharges arising in the premotor frontal area.",

Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic drug marketed since 2000. Its novel mechanism of action is modulation of synaptic neurotransmitter release through binding to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A in the brain. Its pharmacokinetic advantages include rapid and almost complete absorption, minimal insignificant binding to plasma protein, absence of enzyme induction, absence of interactions with other drugs, and partial metabolism outside the liver. The availability of an intravenous preparation is yet another advantage. It has been demonstrated effective as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and myoclonic seizures of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. In addition, it was found equivalent to controlled release carbamazepine as first-line therapy for partial-onset seizures, both in efficacy and tolerability. Its main adverse effects in randomized adjunctive trials in adults have been somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness. In children, the behavioral adverse effects of hostility and nervousness were also noted. Levetiracetam is an important addition to the treatment of epilepsy.",

editor = "Buchanan, Gordon F",
abstract = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. The exact etiology underlying SUDEP is unknown, but cardiorespiratory dysfunction and arousal impairment have been implicated. One proposed risk marker for SUDEP is the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES), a period of reduced EEG activity and impaired arousal that occurs following some seizures. The mechanisms underlying PGES are unknown. Substantial circumstantial evidence suggests serotonin (5-HT) is pertinent to SUDEP as it modulates sleep/wake regulation, breathing, and arousal. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is a major 5-HT center and a component of the ascending arousal system. Seizures disrupt firing of DRN neurons, which may contribute to reduced post-ictal responsiveness. However, the relevance of the DRN to PGES and SUDEP remains unclear.We hypothesized that ictal dysregulation of DRN 5-HT neuron activity contributes to PGES and SUDEP and that increasing 5-HT neurotransmission or activating the DRN before a seizure would decrease PGES or reduce mortality. Pre-ictal administration of selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and activation of DRN 5-HT neurons reduced PGES duration following seizures induced in amygdala kindled mice, a seizure model with low mortality. During PGES, animals exhibited immobility and suppression of EEG activity that was reduced by SSRI pretreatment. In a seizure model with a high mortality rate, we determined that peri-ictal activation of the 5-HT neurons in a specific DRN subnucleus, the dorsomedial dorsal raphe (DRD), reduced mortality without affecting respiratory parameters. These results implicate 5-HT and arousal-promoting regions such as the DRN and its subnuclei in PGES and seizure-induced mortality. It is our hope that these results and future experiments will further define DRN circuit mechanisms that could ultimately inform treatments for SUDEP.",

abstract = "Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate heart rate variability (HRV) parameters in drug-resistant epilepsy patients and to analyze possible associations of HRV parameters with risk factors of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Methods: Forty-five drug-resistant epilepsy patients (23 F, 22 M, mean age 34.7$\pm$11.4) and 37 healthy controls (22 F, 15 M, mean age 32.3$\pm$7.6) were included for 24-hour ambulatory ECG Holter recordings after their consent. The SUDEP-7 inventory was used to estimate the risk of SUDEP. Moreover video-EEGs with generalized convulsive seizures were investigated for postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) which has been suggested as a cause of SUDEP. SUDEP-7 score, EEG and clinical findings were compared with the HRV parameters between the groups statistically. Results: Patients displayed lower SDNN (standard deviation of all R-R intervals) and SDANN-index (standard deviation of mean NN intervals in 5 min recordings) than healthy subjects (p50 ms from adjacent interval divided by the total number of all R-R intervals) and RMSSD (root-mean-square of successive differences) values than the healthy subjects , these findings did not reach statistical significance. The total score on the SUDEP-7 inventory ranged from 1-11, median 4. We did not find any correlations with HRV measures and SUDEP-7 scores. However, the subgroup of patients who displayed PGES on EEG (12 of 45 patients) had significantly lower SDNN than other patients (p=0.02), remarkably. Conclusion: Our HRV findings suggested a decreased sympathetic tone in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy but they did not correlate with known risk factors of SUDEP, except PGES.

author = "Sato, M",
abstract = "Recent advances in kindling studies were reviewed to search a neurobiological mechanism of the epileptogenesis in intractable epilepsy. Consistent findings that indicate the following three issues were available. First, a long-lasting epileptogenesis can develop acquisitively by the repetition of self-sustained epileptic discharges, which may be produced by recurrent changes in the excitatory amino acid system (EAA) via NMDA receptors. Another brief seizure-induced cascading change that occurs in the third and fourth messenger systems through the metabolic EAA receptor may be critical for the persistence of acquired epileptogenesis. Secondly, an unstable balance between the altered EAAergic facilitatory system and insufficient GABAergic inhibitory system may exist in interictal epileptic disorder. The GABAergic inhibition failure as well as excessive EAA transmission may cause the emergence of epileptic seizures. Thirdly, neuronal sprouting in the mossy fiber of the dentate gyrus and a decrease in the neuronal density in the hilar region seem not to be an essential change for induction of the kindling effect. The clinical validity of these histological changes should be further examined in an over-kindling model sufficient to produce spontaneous seizures.",

abstract = "The advance of functional genomics revealed the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Hundreds of GPCRs have been cloned but many of them are orphan GPCRs with unidentified ligands. The first identified orphan GPCR is the opioid receptor like orphan receptor, ORL1. It was cloned in 1994 during the identification of opioid receptor subtypes and was de-orphanized in 1995 by the discovery of its endogenous ligand, nociceptin or orphanin FQ (N/OFQ). This receptor was renamed as N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor. Several selective ligands acting at NOP receptors or other anti-N/OFQ agents have been reported. These include N/OFQ-derived peptides acting as agonists (cyclo[Cys(10),Cys(14)]N/OFQ, [Arg(14), Lys(15)]N/OFQ, [pX]Phe(4)N/OFQ(1-13)-NH(2), UFP-102, [(pF)Phe(4),Aib(7), Aib(11),Arg(14),Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2)) or antagonists (Phe(1)psi(CH(2)-NH)Gly(2)]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH(2), [Nphe(1)]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH(2), UFP-101, [Nphe(1), (pF)Phe(4),Aib(7),Aib(11),Arg(14),Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2)), hexapeptides, other peptide derivatives (peptide III-BTD, ZP-120, OS-461, OS-462, OS-500), non-peptide agonists (NNC 63-0532, Ro 64-6198, (+)-5a compound, W-212393, 3-(4-piperidinyl)indoles, 3-(4-piperidinyl) pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines) and antagonists (TRK-820, J-113397, JTC-801, octahydrobenzimidazol-2-ones, 2-(1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-1 H-indole, N-benzyl-D-prolines, SB-612111), biostable RNA Spiegelmers specific against N/OFQ, and a functional antagonist, nocistatin. Buprenorphine and naloxone benzoylhydrazone are two opioid receptor ligands showing high affinity for NOP receptors. NOP receptor agonists might be beneficial in the treatment of pain, anxiety, stress-induced anorexia, cough, neurogenic bladder, edema, drug dependence, and, less promising, in cerebral ischemia and epilepsy, while antagonists might be of help in the management of pain, depression, dementia and Parkinsonism. N/OFQ is also involved in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and immune regulation. Altered plasma levels of N/OFQ have been reported in patients with various pain states, depression and liver diseases.

abstract = "Objective: We aimed to determine whether patient and provider ratings of the Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) Risk Inventory (SUDEP-7) scores were concordant, and which specific items were best correlated between raters.Background: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for significant mortality in patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). The SUDEP-7 quantifies risk for SUDEP using population-based risk factors, and has been previously correlated with factors that may portend SUDEP such as heart rate variability and ictal cerebral hypoxia.Design/Methods: We distributed questionnaires to patients with DRE (n=181) in our epilepsy monitoring unit, and asked providers to rate these same patients following interview while remaining blinded to patient scores. Patients with psychological or other non-epileptic spells were excluded. Agreement between patient and provider ratings was determined by kappa statistics, and level of agreement for individual Inventory items was determined by factor analysis using JMP software.Results: Overall there was good agreement (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.61) between patient and provider rated SUDEP-7 scores. The factors that correlated best between the raters included >=1 GTCS (kappa−0.72), >=3 GTCS (kappa−0.62) and >3 AEDs (kappa−0.69). Factors that were poorly correlated were >1 any seizure type in last 12 months (kappa−0.35) and >50 any seizure type per month in last 12 months (kappa−0.33). Overall mean SUDEP-7 score values were similar between the raters, mean provider score= 2.0 (SD 1.96, range 0--10), mean patient score=2.2 (SD 1.72, range 0--8).Conclusions: Agreement between patient and provider SUDEP-7 ratings was good, indicating that patient or provider completion of SUDEP-7 surveys is reasonable.

Systemic administration of the glutamatergic agonist kainic acid (KA) is a well characterized model to study epilepsy-induced brain damage. KA-evoked seizures in mice result in hippocampal cell death, with the exception of some strains that are resistant to KA excitotoxicity. Little is known about the factors that prevent epilepsy-related neurodegeneration. Here we show that dopamine has such a function through the activation of the D2 receptor (D2R). D2R gene inactivation confers susceptibility to KA excitotoxicity in two mouse strains known to be resistant to KA-induced neurodegeneration. D2R-/- mice develop seizures when administered KA doses that are not epileptogenic for wild-type (WT) littermates. The spatiotemporal pattern of c-fos and c-jun mRNA induction well correlates with the occurrence of seizures in D2R-/- mice. Moreover, KA-induced seizures result in extensive hippocampal cell death in D2R-/- but not WT mice. In KA-treated D2R-/- mice, hippocampal neurons die by apoptosis, as indicated by the presence of fragmented DNA and the induction of the proapoptotic protein BAX. These results reveal a central role of D2Rs in the inhibitory control of glutamate neurotransmission and excitotoxicity.",

Fos is a nuclear protein that is expressed under conditions of high neuronal activity. We utilized fos immunolabeling techniques on Sprague-Dawley rat brains to identify regions that are activated by antiepileptic stimulation of the left vagus nerve. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) induced specific nuclear fos immunolabeling in several forebrain structures, including the posterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus, cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, ventromedial and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei. In the brainstem, there was specific immunolabeling in vagus nerve nuclei, in the A5 and locus ceruleus noradrenergic nuclei, and in the cochlear nucleus. No labeling of these structures occurred in sham-operated, unstimulated control animals. Intense labeling also occurred in habenular nucleus of thalamus after vagus nerve stimulation, whereas only mild staining occurred in unstimulated animals. Several of the brain structures activated by VNS are important for genesis or regulation of seizures in the forebrain. These structures may mediate the antiepileptic effect of VNS.",

title = "Corticotropin releasing factor receptor type 1 signaling in epilepsy and traumatic brain injury",
author = "Narla, V V Chakravarthi",
abstract = "Stress increases the frequency by which epileptic seizures occur. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) coordinates neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral response to stress. This thesis sought to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CRF regulates the activity of neural circuits in the piriform cortex (PC) in normal and epileptic states. The PC is richly innervated by CRF and 5-HT containing axons arising from the central amygdala and raphe nucleus. CRFR1 and 5-HT2A/CRs have been shown to interact in a manner where CRFR activation subsequently potentiates the activity of 5-HT2A/CRs. The first purpose of this thesis was to determine how the activation of CRFR1 and/or 5-HT2Rs modulates PC activity at both the circuit and cellular level. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging showed that CRF acting through CRFR1 dampened activation of layer II in the PC and interneurons of the endopiriform nucleus. Application of the selective 5-HT2A/CRagonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) following CRFR1 activation potentiated this effect. Blocking the interaction between CRFR1 and 5-HT2R with a Tat-CRFR1-CT peptide abolished this potentiation. Application of forskolin did not mimic CRFR1 activity but instead blocked it, while a protein kinase A antagonist had no effect. However, activation and antagonism of protein kinase C (PKC) either mimicked or blocked CRF modulation respectively. DOI had no effect when applied alone indicating that the prior activation of CRFR1 receptors was critical for the DOI activity. This data shows that CRF and 5-HT, acting through 5-HT2A/CRs, reduce the activation of the PC. This modulation may be an important blunting mechanism of stressor behaviors mediated through the olfactory cortex. Anxiety and stress conditions induce neurons arising from the central amygdala and local interneurons to release CRF in PC, where it normally dampens excitability. The second aim of this thesis was to determine the role of CRF in stress associated epilepsy. We showed that CRF increased the excitability of PC in rats subjected to kindling, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In non-kindled rats, CRF activates its receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and signals through a Gaq/11 mediated pathway as identified in the first aim of this thesis. After seizure induction, CRF signaling occurred through a pathway involving Gas. This change in signaling was associated with reduced abundance of regulator of G-protein signaling protein-2 (RGS2), which promotes the switch in CRFR1 signaling cascade to a Gas dependent mechanism. RGS2 knockout mice responded to CRF in a similar manner as epileptic rats. These observations indicate that",

METHOD: A cross sectional study was carried out in a cohort of 550 patients with refractory epilepsy followed up by the Epilepsy Surgery Program of the University Hospital of PUCRS, Porto Alegre, Brazil, between January, 1992 and July, 2002. Patients were allocated in two groups (operated and non operated). Seizure type, distribution of interictal spikes and MRI findings were correlated with the SUDEP outcome. RESULTS: The estimated incidence of probable SUDEP amounted to 29:1000 individuals. Probable SUDEP occurred in 1.2\% of the 166 patients of the non operated group and in 3.7\% of the 384 patients who were operated (OR=3.02, 95\% CI 0.69-13.16) (p=0.11). Comparing patients who died to patients alive in the operated group a significant difference was observed concerning the following variables: SUDEP patients had a predominance of generalized seizures (p=0.002), extratemporal lesion on MRI (p<0.001) and epileptiform activity over extratemporal regions (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: In surgically treated patients with refractory epilepsy, an extratemporal location of the lesion and of the epileptiform discharges significantly correlated to SUDEP. Thus it is possible that in those patients; the underlying disease may play a role in the pathogenesis of SUDEP.",

abstract = "The expression of fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) has been used widely as a marker of neural activation following the induction of seizures in several experimental models of epilepsy. The purpose of the present study was to provide a more detailed regional analysis of FLI expression following the induction of seizures by maximal electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Tonic-clonic seizures, matched for duration, were induced by MES applied by earclips (40 mA, 1 s) and intraperitoneal injections of PTZ (60 mg/kg); tonic hindlimb extension was present only after MES. Two hours after the induction of seizures brain tissue was processed for FLI. High levels of FLI were induced by both convulsion-inducing processes in a range of structures, including the dentate gyrus, the caudal amygdala, parts of the cerebral cortex, the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, various thalamic nuclei, the lateral parabranchial nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. In other structures, such as the medial and rostral amygdala, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the peripeduncular area, the central gray, and parts of the pretectum and superior colliculus, significantly greater FLI was induced by MES. Only in relatively few structures, such as the reticular thalamic nucleus and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, did PTZ cause a much larger expression of FLI than MES. Insofar as the c-fos technique reflects neuronal activation, the present data reveal potentially important differences in the circuitry underlying the seizures induced in two major experimental models of epilepsy.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To describe the effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on sleep-related breathing in a sample of 16 epilepsy patients. METHODS: Sixteen adults with medically refractory epilepsy (nine men, seven women, ages 21-58 years) underwent baseline polysomnograms (PSGs). Three months after VNS therapy was initiated, PSGs were repeated. In addition, patient 7 had a study with esophageal pressure monitoring, and patient 1 had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) trial. RESULTS: Baseline PSGs: One of 16 patients had an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >5 (6.8). Treatment PSGs: Five of 16 patients had treatment AHIs >5. Respiratory events were more frequent during periods with VNS activation (on-time) than without VNS activation (off-time; p = 0.016). Follow-up studies: Esophageal pressure monitoring in patient 7 showed crescendos in esophageal pressure during VNS activation, supporting an obstructive pattern. The CPAP trial of patient 1 showed that all respiratory events were associated with VNS stimulation at low CPAP levels. They were resolved at higher CPAP levels. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with VNS affects respiration during sleep and should be used with care, particularly in patients with preexisting obstructive sleep apnea. The AHI after VNS treatment remained <5 in the majority of patients and was only mildly elevated (<12) in five patients. In one patient, CPAP resolved VNS-related respiratory events.",

Subsequently, urethane-anesthetized rats were used to study the integrated response to electrical stimulation (1-1.5 hr) of the pontine parabrachial nucleus (PBN), an important center for relay of autonomic information in the brain. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in the brain. To approximate amounts of FLI in the conscious animal, rats were killed immediately after attaining surgical anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) or urethane (1.2-1.7 gm/kg). No FLI was found in the brains of these rats. In rats killed 1 hr after anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital, FLI was found only in the habenulae. After 1 h of urethane anesthesia, low levels of FLI were found in the following areas: nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS); caudal and rostral ventrolateral medulla (VLM); lateral PBN; ventromedial, paraventricular, and supraoptic nuclei (SON) of the hypothalamus; medial preoptic area; central nucleus of the amygdala (ACE); endopiriform cortex; insular cortex; piriform cortex; and islands of Calleja. Electrical stimulation of the PBN (10 sec on, 10 sec off; 15-50 microA at 20 Hz for 60-90 min) in rats anesthetized with urethane led to increases in mean arterial pressure (10-30 mm Hg) and to ipsilateral increases of FLI in the lateral PBN, dorsal division of SON, ACE, endopiriform nucleus, insular cortex, piriform cortex, and islands of Calleja. In two animals, ipsilateral increases were found in the ventromedial hypothalamus and medial amygdaloid nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

abstract = "Despite intensive study, the neurobiological basis of epilepsy and persistent memory impairment following traumatic head injury remains unknown. Since abnormalities of the hippocampus are known to be associated with temporal lobe seizures and memory dysfunction, we investigated the effects of experimental traumatic brain injury on hippocampal structure and function in the rat. Using a model of fluid- percussion injury, we have discovered that neurons of the dentate hilus are vulnerable to a brief, unilateral impact to the extradural surface of the brain. One week after trauma, there was a dramatic reduction in hilar neurons ipsilateral to the impact, and a milder but significant decrease in neurons on the contralateral side as well. This neuronal loss was highly selective since adjacent dentate granule and pyramidal neurons appeared relatively unaffected. Immunocytochemistry showed that the hilar cell loss included a loss of somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons, and degeneration stains provided evidence that irreversible hilar injury occurred within 4 hr of impact. To assess the functional effects of the hilar damage, dentate granule cell field potentials were measured in response to perforant path stimulation. This revealed abnormal dentate granule cell hyperexcitability at 2.0 Hz stimulation in many of the injured animals. The presence of abnormal hyperexcitability correlated with the loss of hilar neurons. Thus, a momentary impact to the surface of the brain can cause selective, bilateral hippocampal injury with associated abnormalities in dentate gyrus physiology. Furthermore, the pattern of cell loss is similar to that observed in some patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

abstract = "This study characterized the electrophysiological and neuropathological changes in rat brains caused by pilocarpine (PILO)-induced status epilepticus (SE) of different duration. SE induced by PILO (375 mg/kg, i.p. adm.) were terminated with a bolus dose of diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.v. adm.) injected 7.5, 15, 30, 60 or 120 min after initiation of the secondary generalization of the SE. Three weeks later, the gain in body weight was significantly reduced in the rats exposed to PILO-induced SE lasting 30 min or more, when compared to controls. Spontaneous seizures were not detected in rats with PILO-induced SE of 7.5 min duration whereas 50 and 25\% of the rats exposed to seizure durations of 30 and 120 min expressed motor seizures. Significant alterations reflecting hyperexcitability (increased number of population spikes (PSs)) and reduced paired-pulse inhibition were observed in recordings of hippocampal field potentials from rats with PILO-induced SE of at least 30 min duration. This was substantiated by brain lesions (necrosis in olfactory cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus) in all rats manifesting a SE of at least 30 min duration. Thus, the results of the present study demonstrate that rats exposed to PILO-induced SE of at least 30 min duration manifest an epileptogenic process, revealed 3 weeks later by several parameters. Among these, hippocampal field potentials appear to represent the most sensitive marker, potentially useful for pharmacological evaluation of drugs with putative antiepileptogenic properties.",

author = "Steven Bradley King, University of Vermont and {Authors}",
abstract = "Chronic or repeated exposure to stressful stimuli can result in several maladaptive consequences, including increased anxiety-like behaviors and altered peptide expression in brain structures involved in emotion. Among these structures, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has been implicated in emotional behaviors as well as regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. In rodents, chronic variate stress (CVS) has been shown to increase BNST pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and its cognate PAC1 receptor transcript, and BNST PACAP signaling may mediate the maladaptive changes associated with chronic stress. In order to determine whether chronic stress would potentiate the behavioral and/or endocrine response to subthreshold BNST PACAP infusion, rats were exposed to a 7 day CVS paradigm previously shown to upregulate BNST PAC1 receptor transcripts; control rats were not stressed. Twenty-four hours following the last stressor, stressed and control rats were bilaterally infused into the BNST with 0.5 µg PACAP. Startle response to intra-BNST PACAP infusion was assessed post-infusion in Experiment 1. In Experiments 2 and 3, blood was sampled via a tail nick 30 min following PACAP infusion to assess the corticosterone response to PACAP following CVS. We found an increase in startle amplitude and an increase in plasma corticosterone levels 30 minutes following BNST PACAP infusion only in rats that had been previously exposed to CVS. These results were likely mediated via PAC1 receptors, as equimolar infusion of the VPAC1/2 receptor ligand vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) had no effect on plasma corticosterone levels. These results suggest that repeated exposure to stressors sensitizes the neural circuits underlying the behavioral and endocrine responses to BNST PACAP infusion and BNST PACAP/PAC1 receptor signaling likely plays a critical role in mediating stress responses.",

author = "Frucht, M M and Quigg, M and Schwaner, C and Fountain, N B",
abstract = "PURPOSE: Previous studies of patient-reported seizure precipitants have not evaluated whether different epilepsy syndromes are differentially affected. METHODS: Patients of a tertiary-care epilepsy center were consecutively surveyed with the use of a standardized questionnaire that lists precipitants that might trigger or exacerbate seizures (alcohol, caffeine, fasting, fatigue, fever or illness, flashing lights, heat or humidity, menstrual cycle, sleep, sleep deprivation, emotional stress, unknown, or other). Patients were classified into epilepsy syndromes according to International League Against Epilepsy criteria. Age and gender within groups defined by major precipitants were compared. Pearson's correlation was performed to evaluate common patterns of precipitants. RESULTS: Of 400 patients, 62\% cited at least one precipitant. In order of frequency, stress (30\%), sleep deprivation (18\%), sleep (14\%), fever or illness (14\%), and fatigue (13\%) were noted by at least 10\% of patients. Stress, fatigue, and sleep deprivation positively correlated, but sleep tended to negatively correlate with other major precipitants. Rankings of precipitants varied within epilepsy syndromes, with patients with temporal lobe epilepsy citing sleep infrequently compared with patients with other epilepsy syndromes. Menstrual effects were ranked highly within major precipitants among women over age 12 and were especially noted by women with temporal lobe epilepsy (28\%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with epilepsy identify a precipitant that triggers or exacerbates seizures. The high correlation of stress, sleep deprivation, and fatigue suggests that they act through common mechanisms to worsen seizure control. Through identification of the effect of both endogenous and exogenous precipitants among syndromes, more research and counseling can be directed to specific precipitants.",

title = "Expanding the role of cannabinoids in the synaptic physiology of the hippocampus",
author = "Hofmann, Mackenzie E",
abstract = "Since the initial discovery that endogenous cannabinoids can act as a retrograde messenger, there has been an explosion of research demonstrating the diverse role they can play in modulating neurotransmission. In the hippocampus they have been shown to modulate both short term and long term plasticities and they have been implicated in the etiology and potential treatment of epilepsy. While much is known about cannabinoid function in the hippocampus, there still remain many unanswered questions. The studies in this dissertation were designed to answer some of these questions about how cannabinoids can modulate synaptic transmission in this area of the brain. In our initial study, we investigated the role of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor at glutamatergic synapses in CA3 pyramidal cells because CB1 at glutamatergic synapses has been understudied compared to CB1 at GABAergic synapses in the hippocampus. We discovered bath application of a cannabinoid agonist inhibited glutamate release from associational/commissural (A/C) synapses but not mossy fiber (MF) synapses demonstrating differential expression of the CB1 receptor. Depolarization of CA3 pyramidal cells caused a calcium dependent release of endogenous cannabinoids (ECs) resulting in a transient decrease in the release of glutamate from A/C synapses. This effect was also sensitive to a CB1 receptor antagonist and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of depolarization induced suppression of excitation (DSE) in CA3 pyramidal cells. Finally, during a previous study on DSI in hilar mossy cells we discovered a novel effect of cannabinoids in the dentate gyrus that we have now further investigated. We found that both endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids could cause an increase in action potential independent exocytosis of GABA through a CB1 receptor independent mechanism. This was unlike traditional cannabinoid signaling which causes a decrease in action potential dependent exocytosis of GABA through the CB1 receptor. The excitatory effect of cannabinoids was still present in CB1, CB2, and TRPV1 antagonists and preserved in CB1 -/- mice. Our data indicate that uncoupling G-proteins from their receptors with suramin prevents the facilitation of action potential independent exocytosis suggesting a role for a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). In support of these results, we found that activation of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A were also necessary for the novel cannabinoid effect suggesting the signaling cascade: GPCR [arrow right] G S [arrow right] adenylyl cyclase [arrow right] cAMP [arrow right] protein kinase A. Finally, we report that a depolarization that could induce EC production and DSI could cause a small but significant increase in action potential independent exocytosis. Our results imply cannabinoids can have a novel, CB1 independent effect on synaptic transmission in the dentate hilus. Overall these studies add significant results to the growing literature of cannabinoid mediated modulation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. We have demonstrated that CB1 is present at glutamatergic synapses in CA3 pyramidal cells, ADPs are potential mechanisms for the physiological induction of DSI, and cannabinoids can have a CB1 independent effect on synaptic transmission.",

The amygdala and hippocampus are implicated in epileptogenesis and autonomic and respiratory control. We examined cardiac and respiratory correlations with single cell discharge in hippocampus and amygdala of patients with epilepsy. We recorded respiration, ECG, and neuronal discharge of amygdala and hippocampus from patients undergoing chronic depth electrode monitoring. Cross-correlation histograms were used to test for neuronal discharge timing relationships with inspiration or the ECG. Inspiratory time, respiratory period and heart rate were calculated for each breath, and linear regression was used to test for correlations with tonic unit rate. Of 183 cells from 24 patients, 20\% had cardiac timing relationships and 23\% showed tonic correlations with changes in heart rate. Only 2\% had timing relationships with the respiratory cycle, while 15\% showed tonic rate relationships with respiratory period. Recording sites did not differ in mean discharge rate or proportion of cells showing these correlations. These results indicate that a significant number of human forebrain cells show discharge modulation by the cardiac cycle and discharge rate correlation with changes in respiration and heart rate. This is supportive of animal models designed to explore the role of mesial temporal lobe structures in regulation of cardiovascular and respiratory systems, although a lower proportion of cells in human temporal lobe showed timing relationships with respiration and there was no clear evidence of anatomic specificity between amygdala and hippocampus.",

Multiple, small injections in this cortical region labeled fibers and terminals throughout the rostro-caudal extent of NTS. Small, single injection showed that the projection is topologically organized: Rostral points along the cortical strip project to rostral parts of NTS, intermediate points to the intermediate levels of NTS and caudal parts of the cortical field to caudal parts of NTS. In NTS the primary cranial nerve afferents distribute along a rostral to caudal gradient with the VII nerve rostral, the IX intermediate and the Xth caudal [2, 6, 37]. The present results indicate that the cortical sensory representation of these cranial nerve afferents reflects their topographic distribution in NTS. This suggests that there is an organized anatomical substrate by which the cerebral cortex may selectively influence the central processing of both gustatory and visceral afferent information in the primary CNS relay for these modalities. This insulofugal pathway also terminates in parts of NTS and additional medullary areas that contain preganglionic parasympathetic motoneurons. This appears to be the first anatomical demonstration of a projection from any part of the cerebral cortex to parasympathetic motor nuclei. The pathway provides a substantial direct channel by which higher cortical activity may modulate parasympathetic function.",

abstract = "Depression represents one of the most disabling comorbidities of epilepsy and impacts profoundly negatively on the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. Some of the clinical features of depression in patients with epilepsy suggest a neurobiological connection, although it is difficult to eliminate psychosocial and iatrogenic factors in human studies. Basic research in animal models has involved the study of depression in a model of absence epilepsy as well as models of limbic epilepsy. In this chapter we focus on studies on animal models with emphasis on discernible mechanistic connections between epilepsy and depression. Depression-like behaviors of despair (immobility in the forced swim test) and anhedonia (loss of preference for sweetened water) have been described in the generalized spike-wave epilepsy model involving the WAG/Rij strain of rats as well as models of limbic epilepsy. The rapid-kindling model of epileptogenesis is not accompanied by discernible injury to the hippocampus or other structures. The lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus (SE)-induced temporal lobe epilepsy displays hippocampal and extra-hippocampal injury and plasticity associated with human temporal lobe epilepsy. Both models produced despair, anhedonia, and alterations in the raphe-hippocampal serotonergic pathways. Pharmacologic studies on the post-SE animals revealed enhanced interleukin-1$\beta$ signaling in the hippocampus and augmentation of ``gain'' in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Chronic infusion of recombinant interleukin receptor antagonist into the hippocampus, as well as infusion of a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist or selective 5-HT1A blocker into the raphe restored evoked serotonin release and behavior. These studies furnish a model system to serve as a screening platform for developing therapies to manage the comorbidity between epilepsy and depression.",

abstract = "Previous immunocytochemical investigations performed in our laboratory on the human hippocampus surgically resected for the treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) have demonstrated an increased expression of the AMPA-receptor subunit GluR1 on neurons in the hilus and area CA3. Light microscopically, many of these neurons exhibited peculiar filamentous extensions and grape-like excrescences that protruded from their somata and proximal dendrites, suggesting that these neurons may be mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons, respectively. The present electron microscopic study was carried out to further characterize these cells. The filamentous extensions were identified as dendrites from which spines often protruded, and the grape-like excrescences represented clusters of closely associated dendrites and spines. A variety of synapses were formed by the GluR1-positive profiles. These arrangements ranged from simple contacts between a single unlabelled axon terminal and a single labelled postsynaptic element, to complex contacts involving multiple unlabelled axon terminals and labelled postsynaptic elements. Many of the axon terminals involved in these arrangements were mossy fibre boutons. Thus, a large proportion of the GluR1-positive neurons were identified as hilar mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons, cells hitherto thought to be absent or greatly reduced in the MTLE hippocampus. Taken together, these data suggest the presence of a highly efficient excitatory circuit involving AMPA receptors, mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons in the sclerotic hippocampus. Such a circuit could be critically involved in the genesis and maintenance of temporal lobe epilepsy.",

abstract = "Objective: To investigate whether abnormal interictal heart rate variability is predictive of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).Background: SUDEP is a tragic and devastating event for people with epilepsy and their families. Unfortunately, the underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood, limiting efforts to develop interventions to prevent this phenomenon. Among people with epilepsy, those with mutations in sodium channel genes are at particularly high risk for SUDEP. Alterations in heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic function, has been proposed as a SUDEP contributing factor, but direct evidence of a relationship has not been shown.Design/Methods: We developed a technique that allowed for retrospective evaluation of HRV, utilizing the ECG derivation from clinical EEG studies. We then studied HRV patterns in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, in order to evaluate the potential contribution of autonomic dysregulation to SUDEP risk. We extracted HRV data, in wakefulness and sleep, from 80 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy; 40 patients with mutations in sodium channel genes (SCN), and 40 control patients with non-SCN drug-resistant epilepsy. From the SCN group, 10 patients had died of SUDEP.Results: The SUDEP patients had the most severe autonomic dysregulation, showing lower awake HRV and either extremely high or low ratios of sleep-to-awake HRV. In a secondary analysis, we also found that patients with SCN mutations had lower awake HRV than the non-SCN drug-resistant epilepsy group.Conclusions: These data demonstrate that autonomic dysregulation is a major contributor to SUDEP. HRV has potential to be used as a biomarker of SUDEP risk, and could allow for more accurate counseling of mortality risk for patients with epilepsy. This biomarker could also facilitate development of therapeutic interventions aimed at SUDEP prevention.Study Supported by:This study was supported by funding from the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, CURE and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council ((NHMRC) Program Grant; IES has a NHMRC Practitioner Fellowship).Disclosure: Dr. Myers has nothing to disclose.

author = "Vicini, Stefano and Dzakpasu, Rhodna",
abstract = "Local field potentials (LFPs) mediated by GABAergic transmission have been recorded from resected human epileptic brain tissue, as confirmed by blockade of these events upon exposure to GABAergic transmission antagonists, and are generated through an unknown mechanism. To better understand the underlying causes of this abnormal synchronization of action potential firing of neurons it is therefore important to study the generation of GABAergic transmission-mediated LFPs. In the 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in vitro model of epilepsy it has been previously established that one type of epileptiform LFP recorded in the hippocampus is generated by GABAergic transmission. Using a 60-channel perforated multi-electrode array (pMEA) I record LFPs and characterize the initiation and propagation of these events in mouse hippocampal slices. I found that LFPs initiated primarily in CA3. Most LFPs were of short duration and were restricted to CA3. I hypothesize that GABA-releasing interneurons in hippocampus are able to synchronize large groups of principal cells through depolarizing GABAergic transmission. Upon spike sorting of single unit activity I uncovered groups of neurons with interneuron characteristics, such as short action potential durations, that appeared to drive the propagation of the LFP from CA3 to DG. By utilizing juxtacellular and voltage clamp recordings and calcium imaging in combination with the pMEA, I also recorded low activity in granule cells during CA3-restricted LFPs and high activity when LFPs propagated to DG. This also suggests interneuron entrainment driving propagation into DG. Therefore, long duration LFPs that propagated to DG from CA3 appeared to recruit GABAergic transmission-mediated mechanisms that allowed for depolarization of most granule cells.",

abstract = "kappa opioid receptor activation inhibits granule cell-mediated excitatory neurotransmission in the hippocampal formation via a decrease in glutamate release from both perforant path and mossy fiber terminals. We now report a third, anatomically and pharmacologically distinct site of such kappa opioid inhibition within the hippocampus. Granule cell population responses to selective stimulation of an excitatory hilar pathway were decreased by the kappa(1) opioid receptor agonist U69,593, an effect blocked by the kappa(1) antagonist norbinaltorphimine. U69,593 also inhibited hilar path induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of granule cell responses. LTP in this pathway was also blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, unlike granule cell mossy fiber LTP in CA3. The kappa opioid peptide dynorphin is present in hilar mossy fiber collaterals. Ultrastructural analysis of these collaterals demonstrated dynorphin-containing vesicles in asymmetric synapses formed between axon terminals and granule cell dendrites, suggesting direct granule cell-granule cell connections. Evoked release of endogenous dynorphin within the hilus was effective in reducing hilar excitation of granule cells, although this release, in contrast to the release of dynorphin in the dentate molecular layer, was not dependent on L-type calcium channels. No hilar path excitation was observed in the absence of bicuculline, suggesting a strong GABA(A)-mediated inhibition of this pathway. However, hilar path activity could be seen after LTP, with or without bicuculline. Thus, kappa opioids can inhibit granule cell recurrent excitation, likely via effects on excitatory mossy fiber collaterals. Such collaterals are thought to be important in mediating temporal lobe epilepsy.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is associated with respiratory effects such as hoarseness, dyspnea, and laryngeal irritation. The effects of VNS on sleep-related breathing in humans have not been reported previously. METHODS: Four epilepsy patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) before and after 3 months of treatment with VNS. Two of the four patients also underwent follow-up PSG to assess the effects of changing stimulus parameters on sleep-related breathing. RESULTS: All patients showed consistent sleep-related decreases in airflow and effort coinciding with VNS activation, although most events did not meet laboratory criteria for apneas or hypopneas. Apneas and hypopneas were more frequent during VNS activation than during nonactivation. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) for three subjects during VNS treatment PSG was <5 apneas and hypopneas/hour. In one patient with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) before VNS treatment, AHI rose from 4 (pretreatment) to 11.3 (treatment). In this patient and in another patient without clinically significant OSA, lowering stimulus frequency, but not stimulus intensity, pulse width, or on-time, ameliorated VNS-related apneas and hypopneas. CONCLUSIONS: VNS is associated with adverse changes in respiration during sleep. In patients without preexisting OSA, this VNS effect is probably not clinically significant. In patients with preexisting OSA, VNS should be administered with care. Lowering VNS stimulus frequency or prolonging off-time may prevent exacerbation of OSA.",

abstract = "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: DEPDC5-related epilepsy encompasses a range of epilepsy syndromes, almost all of which are characterized by focal seizures, with seizure onset in a discrete area of the brain. While most individuals with DEPDC5-related epilepsy have a normal brain MRI, some have epilepsy associated with a cortical malformation, usually focal cortical dysplasia. Seizure syndromes include familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF), autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsies (FMTLE), autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF), and infantile spasms. Although psychomotor development is usually normal, intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder has been reported in some individuals. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of DEPDC5-related epilepsy is established in a proband with focal epilepsy and identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in DEPDC5 on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: The response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is variable. While some individuals respond well to first-line AEDs, others are more refractory to treatment. There is currently no evidence that seizures respond better to one particular AED. In patients with focal cortical dysplasia, the possibility of epilepsy surgery should be explored early in the disease course. Surveillance: Serial EEGs are appropriate when seizure frequency increases or when seizures of new symptomatology occur. Repeat brain MRI with a higher resolution technique is recommended in individuals with treatment-resistant seizures whose first brain MRI was normal. GENETIC COUNSELING: DEPDC5-related epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although de novo DEPDC5 pathogenic variants have been reported, the overall proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with DEPDC5-related epilepsy is at a 50\% risk of inheriting the DEPDC5 pathogenic variant. Once the DEPDC5 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible options.",

Prior studies have implicated amygdala and limbic system in pathogenesis of SUDEP, likely via their role in the autonomic instability. We set out to explore potential predictive markers of SUDEP using morphometric analysis.Design/Methods: Age matched SUDEP (n=8), focal epilepsy with secondary generalization (FEWSG, n=6), primary generalized epilepsy (PGE, n=8) and healthy control (HC, n=8) patients were included in this retrospective study. Structural MRI consisting of high resolution T1 weighted images were used in FreeSurfer to extract cortical thickness and deep gray matter volumes. Multivariate analysis was performed, followed by Mann-Whitney test (SPSS v23) to evaluate group differences in each morphometric variable. Volumes are reported in cubic centimeters, and cortical thickness in millimeters.Results: Patients with FEWSG and PGE had smaller cortical thickness and deep gray matter structures when compared to healthy controls. With exception of amygdala, cortical thickness and striatum in patients with SUDEP were also smaller when compared to healthy controls, but were larger when compared to other epilepsies. Amygdala volume was significantly higher in the SUDEP group (3.42$\pm$0.5, pConclusions: A relatively larger amygdala volume, along with lower cortical thickness and striatal volume may predict the risk of SUDEP in patients with epilepsy. Furthermore, our data supports the role of amygdala, possibly through the retroflex fasciculus or other functional pathway projecting onto the pre-Botzinger complex in ventro-lateral medulla, in pathogenesis of SUDEP.

Although control slices showed steady EPSP depression at frequencies greater than 20 Hz, slices taken from animals 48 h after the last seizure presented pronounced EPSP facilitation at 50 and 100 Hz, followed by steady depression. However, 28 days after kindling, the EPSP facilitation was no longer detectable.

Forty-eight hours after kindling, the fractional AMPA and NMDA receptor--mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) components shifted dramatically in favor of the NMDA receptor--mediated response. Four weeks after kindling, however, AMPA and NMDA receptor--mediated EPSCs reverted to control-like values. Although the granule cells of the dentate gyrus contain mRNA-encoding kainate receptors, neither single nor repetitive perforant path stimuli evoked kainate receptor--mediated EPSCs in control or in kindled rats. The enhanced excitability of the kindled dentate gyrus 48 h after the last seizure, as well as the breakdown of its gating function, appear to result from transiently enhanced NMDA receptor activation that provides significantly slower EPSC kinetics than those observed in control slices and in slices from kindled animals with a 28-day seizure-free interval. Therefore, NMDA receptors seem to play a critical role in the acute throughput of seizure activity and in the induction of the kindled state but not in the persistence of enhanced seizure susceptibility.",

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The factors that influence seizure timing are poorly understood, and seizure unpredictability remains a major cause of disability. Work in chronobiology has shown that cyclical physiological phenomena are ubiquitous, with daily and multiday cycles evident in immune, endocrine, metabolic, neurological, and cardiovascular function. Additionally, work with chronic brain recordings has identified that seizure risk is linked to daily and multiday cycles in brain activity. Here, we provide the first characterization of the relationships between the cyclical modulation of a diverse set of physiological signals, brain activity, and seizure timing. METHODS: In this cohort study, 14 subjects underwent chronic ambulatory monitoring with a multimodal wrist-worn sensor (recording heart rate, accelerometry, electrodermal activity, and temperature) and an implanted responsive neurostimulation system (recording interictal epileptiform abnormalities and electrographic seizures). Wavelet and filter-Hilbert spectral analyses characterized circadian and multiday cycles in brain and wearable recordings. Circular statistics assessed electrographic seizure timing and cycles in physiology. RESULTS: Ten subjects met inclusion criteria. The mean recording duration was 232 days. Seven subjects had reliable electroencephalographic seizure detections (mean = 76 seizures). Multiday cycles were present in all wearable device signals across all subjects. Seizure timing was phase locked to multiday cycles in five (temperature), four (heart rate, phasic electrodermal activity), and three (accelerometry, heart rate variability, tonic electrodermal activity) subjects. Notably, after regression of behavioral covariates from heart rate, six of seven subjects had seizure phase locking to the residual heart rate signal. SIGNIFICANCE: Seizure timing is associated with daily and multiday cycles in multiple physiological processes. Chronic multimodal wearable device recordings can situate rare paroxysmal events, like seizures, within a broader chronobiology context of the individual. Wearable devices may advance the understanding of factors that influence seizure risk and enable personalized time-varying approaches to epilepsy care.",

author = "Lepeak, Lauren K",
abstract = "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide whose functions range over the entire body, from cell functions and apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation, to metabolic, cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological processes. It is upregulated during chronic stress and implements further activation of the stress pathway, while also being protective for both neurons and various cells during cellular damage and inflammation. PACAP mRNA has been found throughout the entire central nervous system, from the most anterior part of the brain in the olfactory cortex, down into sensory and motor spinal nuclei. PACAP expression has been found in both liver and cardiovascular tissue. In regards to chronic stress and anxiety, PACAP is highly active in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), as well as the central amygdala and hypothalamus. The vast range of structures and resulting functions that PACAP influences makes it a promising neuropeptide to study to understand the concept of whole body stress. This study focused on the expression of PACAP throughout the whole brain of both stressed and unstressed mice to better understand the relationship of PACAP and other body systems that are affected by stress. This was achieved by infusion of a virus, that would fluorescently express PACAP cells, into the BNST to see how stress impacts the expression of PACAP throughout the brain stemming from the BNST. While no stark difference was found between stressed and unstressed brains, new areas and pathways were discovered that had not been previously implicated in PACAP and stress. The medial habenular nucleus (MHb) and stria medullaris pathway were expressed robustly for almost all of the brains; this structure and pathway are important in mood disorders, PTSD, stress, memory and addiction. The BNST and PACAP play vital roles in these behaviors as well.",
